the	at

Given	vbn

how	wrb
could	md
anyone	pn
have	hv
questioned	vbn
this	dt
principle	nn
?	.
?	.

First	od
,	,
the	at
observational	jj
reasons	nns
.	.

The	at
obvious	jj
natural	jj
fact	nn
to	in
ancient	jj

was	bedz
the	at
diurnal	jj
rotation	nn
of	in
the	at

The	at
conclusion	nn
--	--
the	at
distances	nns

did	dod
not	*
vary	vb
and	cc
their	pp$

The	at

were	bed
also	rb
felt	vbn
to	to

the	at

of	in

things	nns
.	.

This	dt
,	,
conjoined	vbn
with	in
the	at
considerations	nns
above	rb
,	,
made	vbd
the	at
circular	jj
motions	nns
of	in
heavenly	jj
bodies	nns
appear	vb
an	at
almost	ql
directly	rb
observed	vbn
fact	nn
.	.

By	in
distinguishing	vbg
superlunary	jj
(	(
celestial	jj
)	)
and	cc
sublunary	jj
(	(
terrestrial	jj
)	)
existence	nn
,	,
and	cc
reinforcing	vbg
this	dt
with	in
the	at
four-element	jj
physics	nn
of	in
Empedocles	np

came	vbd

which	wdt

in	in
only	rb
a	at

,	,
viz.	rb
in	in
a	at

Because	cs
motion	nn
which	wdt
begins	vbz
and	cc
ends	vbz
at	in
discrete	jj
places	nns
would	md
(	(
e.g.	rb
for	in

be	be

Circular	jj
motion	nn
,	,
however	rb
,	,
since	cs
it	pps
is	bez
eternal	jj
and	cc
perfectly	ql
continuous	jj
,	,
lacks	vbz

Perfect	jj

if	cs

move	vb
at	in
all	abn

do	do
not	*
move	vb

what	wdt
they	ppss

Thus	rb
,	,
circular	jj
motion	nn
is	bez
itself	ppl
one	cd
of	in
the	at
essential	jj
characteristics	nns
of	in
completely	ql

The	at

on	in

However	rb

In	in

to	to

This	dt
is	bez

to	to

His	pp$

which	wdt

All	abn

this	dt

One	cd

of	in

he	pps

It	pps

Brakes	nns
howled	vbd

So	cs
the	at

Now	rb

He	pps
