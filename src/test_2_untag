The
jury
further
said
in
term-end
presentments
that
the
City
Executive
Committee
,
which
had
over-all
charge
of
the
election
,
deserves
the
praise
and
thanks
of
the
City
of
Atlanta
for
the
manner
in
which
the
election
was
conducted
.

The
September-October
term
jury
had
been
charged
by
Fulton
Superior
Court
Judge
Durwood
Pye
to
investigate
reports
of
possible
irregularities
in
the
hard-fought
primary
which
was
won
by
Mayor-nominate
Ivan
Allen
Jr.
.

However
,
the
jury
said
it
believes
these
two
offices
should
be
combined
to
achieve
greater
efficiency
and
reduce
the
cost
of
administration
.

Implementation
of
Georgia's
automobile
title
law
was
also
recommended
by
the
outgoing
jury
.

This
is
one
of
the
major
items
in
the
Fulton
County
general
assistance
program
,
the
jury
said
,
but
the
State
Welfare
Department
has
seen
fit
to
distribute
these
funds
through
the
welfare
departments
of
all
the
counties
in
the
state
with
the
exception
of
Fulton
County
,
which
receives
none
of
this
money
.

Four
additional
deputies
be
employed
at
the
Fulton
County
Jail
and
a
doctor
,
medical
intern
or
extern
be
employed
for
night
and
weekend
duty
at
the
jail
.

The
jury
praised
the
administration
and
operation
of
the
Atlanta
Police
Department
,
the
Fulton
Tax
Commissioner's
Office
,
the
Bellwood
and
Alpharetta
prison
farms
,
Grady
Hospital
and
the
Fulton
Health
Department
.

His
petition
charged
mental
cruelty
.

The
petition
listed
the
mayor's
occupation
as
attorney
and
his
age
as
71
.

Henry
L.
Bowden
was
listed
on
the
petition
as
the
mayor's
attorney
.

The
mayor's
present
term
of
office
expires
Jan.
1
.

State
Party
Chairman
James
W.
Dorsey
added
that
enthusiasm
was
picking
up
for
a
state
rally
to
be
held
Sept.
8
in
Savannah
at
which
newly
elected
Texas
Sen.
John
Tower
will
be
the
featured
speaker
.

Five
per
cent
of
the
voters
in
each
county
must
sign
petitions
requesting
that
the
Republicans
be
allowed
to
place
names
of
candidates
on
the
general
election
ballot
,
or
2

The
Republicans
must
hold
a
primary
under
the
county
unit
system
--
a
system
which
the
party
opposes
in
its
platform
.

Caldwell's
resignation
had
been
expected
for
some
time
.

The
Georgia
Legislature
will
wind
up
its
1961
session
Monday
and
head
for
home
--
where
some
of
the
highway
bond
money
it
approved
will
follow
shortly
.

The
bond
issue
will
go
to
the
state
courts
for
a
friendly
test
suit
to
test
the
validity
of
the
act
,
and
then
the
sales
will
begin
and
contracts
let
for
repair
work
on
some
of
Georgia's
most
heavily
traveled
highways
.

Pelham
said
Sunday
night
there
was
research
being
done
on
whether
the
quickie
vote
on
the
increase
can
be
repealed
outright
or
whether
notice
would
have
to
first
be
given
that
reconsideration
of
the
action
would
be
sought
.

The
new
school
superintendent
is
Harry
Davis
,
a
veteran
agriculture
teacher
,
who
defeated
Felix
Bush
,
a
school
principal
and
chairman
of
the
Miller
County
Democratic
Executive
Committee
.

This
was
the
coolest
,
calmest
election
I
ever
saw
,
Colquitt
Policeman
Tom
Williams
said
.

Ordinary
Williams
said
he
,
too
,
was
subjected
to
anonymous
calls
soon
after
he
scheduled
the
election
.

Everything
went
real
smooth
,
the
sheriff
said
.

His
contention
was
denied
by
several
bankers
,
including
Scott
Hudson
of
Sherman
,
Gaynor
B.
Jones
of
Houston
,
J.

Brady
of

Senators
unanimously
approved
Thursday
the
bill
of
Sen.
George
Parkhouse
of
Dallas
authorizing
establishment
of
day
schools
for
the
deaf
in
Dallas
and
the
four
other
largest
counties
.

The
bill
is
designed
to
provide
special
schooling
for
more
deaf
students
in
the
scholastic
age
at
a
reduced
cost
to
the
state
.

Operating
budget
for
the
day
schools
in
the
five
counties
of
Dallas
,
Harris
,
Bexar
,
Tarrant
and
El
Paso
would
be
$451,500
,
which
would
be
a
savings
of
$157,460
yearly
after
the
first
year's
capital
outlay
of
$88,000
was
absorbed
,
Parkhouse
told
the
Senate
.

The
TEA
estimated
there
would
be
182
scholastics
to
attend
the
day
school
in
Dallas
County
,
saving
them
from
coming
to
Austin
to
live
in
the
state
deaf
school
.

We
are
getting
more
'

said
Ratcliff
.

One
validated
acts
of
school
districts
.

The
third
amended
the
enabling
act
for
creation
of
the
Lamar
county
Hospital
District
,
for
which
a
special
constitutional
amendment
previously
was
adopted
.

One
,
by
Sen.
Louis
Crump
of
San
Saba
,
would
aid
more
than
17,000
retailers
who
pay
a
group
of
miscellaneous
excise
taxes
by
eliminating
the
requirement
that
each
return
be
notarized
.

An
adverse
vote
of
81
to
65
kept
in
the
State
Affairs
Committee
a
bill
which
would
order
the
referendum
on
the
April
4
ballot
,
when
Texas
votes
on
a
U.S.
senator
.

Rep.
James
Cotten
of
Weatherford
insisted
that
a
water
development
bill
passed
by
the
Texas
House
of
Representatives
was
an
effort
by
big
cities
like
Dallas
and
Fort
Worth
to
cover
up
places
like
Paradise
,
a
Wise
County
hamlet
of
250
people
.

--
A
Houston
teacher
,
now
serving
in
the
Legislature
,
proposed
Thursday
a
law
reducing
the
time
spent
learning
educational
methods
.

Dr.
Clark
holds
an
earned
Doctor
of
Education

from

University

Principals
of
the
13
schools
in
the
Denton
Independent
School
District
have
been
re-elected
for
the
1961-62
session
upon
the
recommendation
of
Supt.
Chester
O.
Strickland
.

State
and
federal
legislation
against
racial
discrimination
in
employment
was
called
for
yesterday
in
a
report
of
a
blue
ribbon
citizens
committee
on
the
aid
to
dependent
children
program
.

The
report
called
racial
discrimination
in
employment
one
of
the
most
serious
causes
of
family
breakdown
,
desertion
,
and
ADC
dependency
.

Judge
Parsons
leaned
over
the
bench
and
inquired
,
You
mean
some
of
the
defendants
made
statements
admitting
this
?
?

Shortly
after
the
Chief
Executive
returned
to
Washington
in
midmorning
from
Hyannis
Port
,
Mass.
,
a
White
House
spokesman
said
the
address
text
still
had
quite
a
way
to
go
toward
completion
.

Mayer
Goldberg
,
attorney
for
election
judges
in
the
58th
precinct
of
the
23d
ward
,
argued
this
procedure
constituted
intimidation
.

Wexler
had
charged
the
precinct
judges
in
these
cases
with
complementary
miscount
of
the
vote
,
in
which
votes
would
be
taken
from
one
candidate
and
given
to
another
.

The
case
of
the
judges
in
the
58th
precinct
of
the
23d
ward
had
been
heard
previously
and
taken
under
advisement
by
Karns
.

After
reading
his
statement
discharging
the
23d
ward
case
,
Karns
told
Wexler
that
if
the
seven
cases
scheduled
for
trial
also
involved
persons
who
had
been
subpenaed
,
he
would
dismiss
them
.

It
would
be
financed
by
boosting
the
social
security
payroll
tax
by
as
much
as
$37
a
year
for
each
of
the
workers
now
paying
such
taxes
.

The
social
security
payroll
tax
is
now
6
per
cent
--
3
per
cent
on
each
worker
and
employer
--
on
the
first
$4,800
of
pay
per
year
.

Similar
payroll
tax
boosts
would
be
imposed
on
those
under
the
railroad
retirement
system
.

The
aged
care
plan
carries
these
benefits
for
persons
over
65
who
are
under
the
social
security
and
railroad
retirement
systems
:
1

A
patient
could
receive
up
to
300
days
paid-for
nursing
home
care
under
a
unit
formula
allowing
more
of
such
care
for
those
who
use
none
or
only
part
of
the
hospital-care
credit
.

Officials
estimated
the
combined
programs
would
cost
5.1
million
dollars
the
first
year
and
would
go
up
to
21
millions
by
1966
.

More
for
nursing
homes

He
further
proposed
grants
of
an
unspecified
sum
for
experimental
hospitals
.

He
also
asked
Congress
to
approve
establishment
of
a
national
child
health
institute
.

The
President
said
his
proposals
combine
the
indispensable
elements
in
a
sound
health
program
--
people
,
knowledge
,
services
,
facilities
,
and
the
means
to
pay
for
them
.

Those
who
backed
a
similar
plan
last
year
hailed
the
message
.

In
the
last
eight
years
,
all
Presidential
appointments
,
including
those
of
cabinet
rank
,
have
been
denied
immediate
action
because
of
a
Senate
rule
requiring
at
least
a
24
hour
delay
after
they
are
reported
to
the
floor
.

The
general
,
remarkably
courteous
,
explanation
has
left
basic
positions
unchanged
,
but
there
has
been
no
explosion
in
the
council
.

There
should
even
be
no
more
bitter
surprises
in
the
UN
General
Assembly
as
to
NATO
members'
votes
,
since
a
new
ad
hoc
NATO
committee
has
been
set
up
so
that
in
the
future
such
topics
as
Angola
will
be
discussed
in
advance
.

The
Secretary
of
State
himself
,
in
his
first
speech
,
gave
some
idea
of
the
tremendous
march
of
events
inside
and
outside
the
United
States
that
has
preoccupied
the
new
administration
in
the
past
four
months
.

The
annual
spring
meeting
has
given
an
impetus
in
three
main
directions
:
more
,
deeper
,
and
more
timely
political
consultation
within
the
alliance
,
the
use
of
the
Organization
for
Economic
Cooperation
and
Development
(
when
ratified
)
as
a
method
of
coordinating
aid
to
the
underdeveloped
countries
,
and
the
need
for
strengthening
conventional
forces
as
well
as
the
maintenance
of
the
nuclear
deterrent
.

This
increase
in
the
threshold
,
as
the
conventional
forces
strengthening
is
called
,
will
prove
one
of
the
alliance's
most
difficult
problems
in
the
months
to
come
.

The
Kennedy
administration
moves
haltingly
toward
a
Geneva
conference
on
Laos
just
as
serious
debate
over
its
foreign
policy
erupts
for
the
first
time
.

But
it
is
apparent
that
no
acceptable
formula
has
been
found
to
prevent
such
a
possibility
.

It
excuses
these
actions
as
being
the
chain
reaction
to
basic
errors
made
in
the
previous
administration
.

But
with
the
months
moving
on
--
and
the
immediate
confrontations
with
the
Communists
showing
no
gain
for
the
free
world
--
the
question
arises
:

He
was
critical
of
what
he
feels
is
President
Kennedy's
tendency
to
be
too
conciliatory
.

Very
early
in
his
administration
he
informed
the
Kremlin
through
diplomatic
channels
,
a
high
official
source
disclosed
,
that
the
new
administration
would
react
even
tougher
than
the
Eisenhower
administration
would
during
the
formative
period
of
the
administration
.

(
Some
SEATO
nations
disagreed
,
however
.

There
was
the
further
complication
that
the
administration
had
very
early
concluded
that
Laos
was
ill
suited
to
be
an
ally
,
unlike
its
more
determined
neighbors
,
Thailand
and
South
Viet
Nam
.

The
pro-Western
government
,
which
the
United
States
had
helped
in
a
revolt
against
the
Souvanna
Phouma
neutralist
government
,
never
did
appear
to
spark
much
fighting
spirit
in
the
Royal
Lao
Army
.

He
is
not
interested
in
being
named
a
full-time
director
.

He
expressed
the
opinion
the
city
could
hire
a
CD
director
for
about
$3,500
a
year
and
would
only
have
to
put
up
half
that
amount
on
a
matching
fund
basis
to
defray
the
salary
costs
.

He
would
assign
one
of
the
rescue
trucks
to
the
Riverside
section
of
the
city
and
the
other
to
the
Rumford
area
.

Should
there
be
evidence
they
are
shirking
,
he
has
said
,
the
state
police
will
step
into
the
situation
.

There
has
been
more
activity
across
the
state
line
in
Massachusetts
than
in
Rhode
Island
in
recent
weeks
toward
enforcement
of
the
Sunday
sales
laws
.

Mr.
Reama
told
the
Rotary
Club
of
Providence
at
its
luncheon
at
the
Sheraton-Biltmore
Hotel
that
about
half
of
the
people
in
the
country
want
the
welfare
type
of
government
and
the
other
half
want
a
free
enterprise
system
.

He
steered
me
to
the
right
track
--
the
free
enterprise
track
.

He
said
he
favors
wage
increases
for
workers
--
but
manufacturers
are
caught
in
a
profit
squeeze
--
and
raises
should
only
come
when
the
public
is
conditioned
to
higher
prices
,
he
added
.

The
law
which
governs
home
rule
charter
petitions
states
that
they
must
be
referred
to
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
canvassers
for
verification
of
the
signatures
within
10
days
and
Mr.
Martinelli
happens
to
hold
that
post
.

At
present
all
offenses
must
be
taken
to
Sixth
District
Court
for
disposition
.

James
P.
Mitchell
and
Sen.
Walter
H.
Jones
R-Bergen
,
last
night
disagreed
on
the
value
of
using
as
a
campaign
issue
a
remark
by
Richard
J.
Hughes
,
Democratic
gubernatorial
candidate
,
that
the
GOP
is
Campaigning
on
the
carcass
of
Eisenhower
Republicanism
.

Mitchell
was
for
using
it
,
Jones
against
,
and
Sen.
Wayne
Dumont
Jr.
R-Warren
did
not
mention
it
when
the
three
Republican
gubernatorial
candidates
spoke
at
staggered
intervals
before
100
persons
at
the
Park
Hotel
.

It
was
greeted
with
a
chorus
of
boos
by
500
women
in
Trenton
Monday
at
a
forum
of
the
State
Federation
of
Women's
Clubs
.

He
then
launched
into
what
the
issues
should
be
in
the
campaign
.

Earlier
,
Mitchell
said
in
a
statement
:

It
is
a
desperate
effort
to
prop
up
a
sagging
candidate
who
has
proven
he
cannot
answer
any
questions
about
New
Jersey's
problems
.

Sandman
announced
the
appointment
of
Mrs.
Harriet
Copeland
Greenfield
of
330
Woodland
Ave.
,
Westfield
,
as
state
chairman
of
the
Republican
Women
for
Jones
Committee
.

County
Supervisor
Weldon
R.
Sheets
,
who
is
a
candidate
for
the
Democratic
gubernatorial
nomination
,
today
called
for
an
end
to
paper
ballots
in
those
counties
in
the
state
which
still
use
them
.

Sheets
added
that
he
would
ask
for
exclusive
use
of
voting
machines
in
the
state
by
January
,
1964
.

My
experience
as
public
safety
commissioner
,
Roos
said
,
has
shown
me
that
the
office
of
sheriff
is
best
filled
by
a
man
with
law
enforcement
experience
,
and
preferably
one
who
is
a
lawyer
.

Jim
Sheeran
fits
that
description
.

In
his
only
attack
on
the
Republicans
,
Hughes
said
,
The
three
Republican
candidates
for
governor
are
tripping
over
their
feet
for
popular
slogans
to
win
the
primary
.

He
urged
New
Jersey
to
become
a
full
partner
in
the
courageous
actions
of
President
Kennedy
.

The
other
$15
million
is
to
be
alloted
to
municipalities
on
a
matching
fund
basis
.

She
served
one
four-year
term
on
the
national
committee
.

At
the
same
time
reaction
among
anti-organization
Democratic
leaders
and
in
the
Liberal
party
to
the
Mayor's
reported
plan
was
generally
favorable
.

As
usual
,
he
made
no
attempt
to
get
in
touch
with
Carmine
G.
De
Sapio
,
the
Manhattan
leader
.

--
A
wave
of
public
resentment
against
corruption
in
government
is
rising
in
Massachusetts
.

The
taxi
driver
taking
the
visitor
from
the
airport
remarks
that
politicians
in
the
state
are
all
the
same
.

Corruption
is
hardly
a
recent
development
in
the
city
and
state
that
were
widely
identified
as
the
locale
of
Edwin
O'Connor's
novel

The
Last
Hurrah
.

Washington
,
June
18

In
the
House
,
the
Southern-Republican
coalition
is
expected
to
make
another
major
stand
in
opposition
to
the
Administration's
housing
bill
,
while
more
jockeying
is
expected
in
an
attempt
to
advance
the
aid-to-education
bill
.

It
is
expected
to
be
reported
out
Tuesday
,
but
this
is
a
little
uncertain
.

In
the
$40,000,000
budget
that
has
been
submitted
for
Congressional
approval
,
$26,000,000
would
be
spent
through
universities
and
private
voluntary
agencies
.

There
are
a
number
of
ways
this
could
happen
,
the
churchmen
pointed
out
,
and
here
is
an
example
:

Why
do
you
worry
?
?

The
U.
S.
Government
is
paying
for
it
.

The
hotel
owner
shrugged
.

And
then
,
some
churchmen
remarked
,
there
is
a
more
classical
church-state
problem
:

This
was
disclosed
today
by
a
responsible
source
amid
intensified
efforts
by
the
Soviet
Union
to
gain
a
greater
role
in
the
staff
and
operation
of
the
United
Nations
.

Each
member
would
get
one
post
for
each
10,000,000
people
in
its
population
up
to
150,000,000
people
or
a
maximum
of
fifteen
posts
.

Barnett
,
as
the
titular
head
of
the
Democratic
party
,
apparently
must
make
the
move
to
reestablish
relations
with
the
national
Democratic
party
or
see
a
movement
come
from
the
loyalist
ranks
to
completely
bypass
him
as
a
party
functionary
.

The
year
will
probably
start
out
with
segregation
still
the
most
troublesome
issue
.

The
transition
from
segregation
to
finances
might
already
be
in
progress
,
in
the
form
of
an
administration
proposal
to
hike
the
state
sales
tax
from
2
per
cent
to
3
per
cent
.

But
the
tardiness
of
the
administration
in
making
the
dedication
has
caused
legislators
to
suspect
the
tax
bill
was
related
more
directly
to
an
over-all
shortage
of
cash
than
to
segregation
.

If
it
fails
to
pass
,
he
can
throw
up
his
hands
and
say
the
Legislature
would
not
support
him
in
his
efforts
to
prevent
integration
.

He
could
terminate
special
sessions
of
the
Legislature
.

They
would
like
to
convey
the
notion
something
is
being
done
,
even
though
it
is
something
they
know
to
be
ineffectual
.

Passage
of
the
sales
tax
measure
would
also
give
Davis
the
means
to
effect
a
transition
.

Then
he
could
tell
them
to
go
home
,
while
the
administration
continued
to
wage
the
battle
with
the
$28
million
in
extra
revenues
the
sales
tax
measure
would
bring
in
over
an
eight
months
period
.

But
if
the
administration
should
find
it
does
not
need
the
$28
million
for
a
grant-in-aid
program
,
a
not
unlikely
conclusion
,
it
could
very
well
seek
a
way
to
use
the
money
for
other
purposes
.

It
is
one
that
most
try
to
avoid
,
as
long
as
they
can
see
an
alternative
approach
to
the
problem
.

The
new
year
might
see
some
house-cleaning
,
either
genuine
or
token
,
depending
upon
developments
,
to
give
Davis
an
opportunity
to
combat
some
of
these
criticisms
.

The
Controller's
charge
of
rigging
was
the
latest
development
in
an
investigation
which
also
brought
these
disclosures
Tuesday
:

The
city
has
sued
for
the
full
amount
of
the
$172,400
performance
bond
covering
the
contract
.

Varani
has
been
fired
on
charges
of
accepting
gifts
from
the
contractor
.

The
suit
was
filed
later
in
the
day
in
Common
Pleas
Court
7
against
the
Hughes
company
and
two
bonding
firms
.

At
Berger's
direction
,
the
city
also
intervened
in
the
Hughes
bankruptcy
case
in
U.
S.
District
Court
in
a
move
preliminary
to
filing
a
claim
there
.

I
am
taking
the
position
that
the
contract
was
clearly
violated
,
Berger
said
.

Wide
range
in
bids

We
won't
know
the
full
amount
until
we
get
a
full
report
,
Wagner
said
.

We
can
claim
on
the
maximum
amount
of
the
bond
,
Berger
said
.

The
PTC
is
investigating
the
whole
matter
,
Pratt
said
.

The
new
fees
are
expected
to
raise
an
additional
$740,000
in
the
remainder
of
1961
and
$2,330,000
more
a
year
after
that
.

A
proposal
to
raise
dog
license
fees
drew
an
objection
from
Councilwoman
Virginia
Knauer
,
who
formerly
raised
pedigreed
dogs
.

Mrs.
Knauer
said
she
did
not
think
dog
owners
should
be
penalized
for
the
city's
services
to
animal
care
.

The
City
Planning
Commission
on
Tuesday
approved
agreements
between
two
redevelopers
and
the
Redevelopment
Authority
for
the
purchase
of
land
in
the
$300,000,000
Eastwick
Redevelopment
Area
project
.

One
of
the
agreements
calls
for
the
New
Eastwick
Corp.
to
purchase
a
1311
acre
tract
for
$12,192,865
.

It
is
designated
as
Stage
1
Residential
on
the
Redevelopment
Authority's
master
plan
and
will
feature
row
houses
,
garden
apartments
,
four
small
parks
,
schools
,
churches
,
a
shopping
center
and
several
small
clusters
of
stores
.

The
plan
calls
for
dividing
the
project
into
16
sectors
which
would
be
barred
to
vehicular
traffic

The
fire

association
here
offered
a
$5,000
reward
for
information
leading
to
the

Martin
,
who
has
been
in
office
in
Washington
,
D.
C.
,
for
13
months
spoke
at
the
council's
annual
meeting
at
the
Multnomah
Hotel
.

We
must
persuade
them
to
enjoy
a
way
of
life
which
,
if
not
identical
,
is
congenial
with
ours
,
he
said
but
adding
that
if
they
do
not
develop
the
kind
of
society
they
themselves
want
it
will
lack
ritiuality
and
loyalty
.

He
cited
East
Germany
where
after
15
years
of
Soviet
rule
it
has
become
necessary
to
build
a
wall
to
keep
the
people
in
,
and
added
,
so
long
as
people
rebel
,
we
must
not
give
up
.

Dr.
Melvin
W.
Barnes
,
superintendent
,
said
he
thought
the
schools
were
waiting
for
some
leadership
,
perhaps
on
the
national
level
,
to
make
sure
that
whatever
steps
of
planning
they
took
would
be
more
fruitful
,
and
that
he
had
found
that
other
school
districts
were
not
as
far
along
in
their
planning
as
this
district
.

Los
Angeles
has
said
they
would
send

His
exaltation
to
the

Friday
afternoon
the
Rev.
T.
F.
Zimmerman
was
reelected
for
his
second
consecutive
two-year
term
as
general
superintendent
of
Assemblies
of
God
.

To
step
up
the
denomination's
program
,
the
Rev.
Mr.
Brandt
suggested
the
vision
of
8,000
new
Assemblies
of
God
churches
in
the
next
10
years
.

To
accomplish
this
would
necessitate
some
changes
in
methods
,
he
said
.

--
Arranging
for
ministerial
graduates
to
spend
from
6-12
months
as
apprentices
in
well-established
churches
.

Denials
were
of
motions
of
dismissal
,
continuance
,
mistrial
,
separate
trial
,
acquittal
,
striking
of
testimony
and
directed
verdict
.

It
is
not
necessary
that
a
defendant
actually
have
conpired
to
use
the
U.S.
mails
to
defraud
as
long
as
there
is
evidence
of
a
conspiracy
,
and
the
mails
were
then
used
to
carry
it
out
.

In
the
afternoon
,
defense
attorneys
began
the
presentation
of
their
cases
with
opening
statements
,
some
of
which
had
been
deferred
until
after
the
government
had
called
witnesses
and
presented
its
case
.

A
two-run
homer
by
Norm
Siebern
and
a
solo
blast
by
Bill
Tuttle
tied
the
game
,
and
single
runs
in
the
eighth
and
ninth
gave
the
Athletics
their
fifth
victory
in
eight
starts
.

Catcher
Frank
House's
throw
in
an
effort
to
nab
Throneberry
was
wide
and
in
the
dirt
.

Rookie
southpaw
George
Stepanovich
relieved
Hyde
at
the
start
of
the
ninth
and
gave
up
the
A's
fifth
tally
on
a
walk
to
second
baseman
Dick
Howser
,
a
wild
pitch
,
and
Frank
Cipriani's
single
under
Shortstop
Jerry
Adair's
glove
into
center
.

The
Orioles
once
again
performed
at
the
plate
in
powderpuff
fashion
,
gathering
only
seven
blows
off
the
offerings
of
three
Kansas
City
pitchers
.

The
Flock
added
a
pair
of
tallies
in
the
third
on
three
straight
hits
after
two
were
out
.

Then
Robinson
slammed
a
long
double
to
left
center
to
score
both
runners
.

When
Robinson
tried
to
stretch
his
blow
into
a
triple
,
he
was
cut
down
in
a
close
play
at
third
,
Tuttle
to
Andy
Carey
.

Then
Throneberry
rapped
into
a
fast
double
play
.

--
The
flavor
of
Baltimore's
Florida
Grapefruit
League
news
ripened
considerably
late
today
when
the
Orioles
were
advised
that
Ron
Hansen
has
fulfilled
his
obligations
under
the
Army's
military
training
program
and
is
ready
for
belated
spring
training
.

The
6-foot
3-inch
Hansen
checked
in
close
to
200
pounds
,
15
pounds
lighter
than
his
reporting
weight
last
spring
.

He
hopes
to
melt
off
an
additional
eight
pounds
before
the
Flock
breaks
camp
three
weeks
hence
.

When
he
was
inducted
into
the
Army
at
Fort
Knox
,
Ky.
,
Hansen's
weight
had
dropped
to
180
--
too
light
for
me
to
be
at
my
best
he
said
.

Unfortunately
,
Brooks's
teammates
were
not
in
such
festive
mood
as
the
Orioles
expired
before
the
seven-hit
pitching
of
three
Kansas
City
rookie
hurlers
.

Richard
M.
Forbes's
Paget
,
which
had
what
seemed
to
be
a
substantial
lead
in
the
early
stages
,
tired
rapidly
nearing
the
wire
and
was
able
to
save
place
money
only
a
head
in
front
of
Glen
T.
Hallowell's
Milties
Miss
.

Prior
to
the

race
,
the
stewards
announced
that
apprentice
James

Verrone
is
suspended
ten
days
for
crowding
horses
and
crossing
the
field
sharply
in

races
on

Time
stands
still
every
time
Moritz
,
a
26-year-old
Army
Signal
Corps
veteran
,
goes
into
the
field
.

Moritz
is
listed
on
the
Longhorn
roster
as
a
right
halfback
,
the
position
at
which
he
lettered
on
the
1956
team
.

But
ask
coach
Darrell
Royal
what
position
he
plays
and
you'll
get
the
quick
response
,
place-kicker
.

So
I
started
practicing
on
it
in
spring
training
.

He
missed
the
1955
season
because
of
an
operation
on
the
ailing
knee
,
then
played
77
minutes
in
1956
.

His
statistical
record
that
year
,
when
Texas
won
only
one
game
and
lost
nine
,
was
far
from
impressive
:
he
carried
the
ball
three
times
for
a
net
gain
of
10
yards
,
punted
once
for
39
yards
and
caught
one
pass
for
13
yards
.

I've
tried
to
teach
some
of
the
other
boys
to
kick
and
some
of
them
can't
seem
to
get
the
feel
.

If
you
kick
too
much
,
your
leg
gets
kinda
dead
,
he
explained
.

In
their
first
three
games
,
the
Longhorns
have
had
the
ball
41
times
and
scored
16
times
,
or
40
per
cent
;
;

Tailback
James
Saxton
already
has
surpassed
his
rushing
total
for
his
brilliant
sophomore
season
,
when
he
netted
271
yards
on
55
carries
;
;

Wingback
Jack
Collins
injured
a
knee
in
the
Washington
State
game
but
insists
he'll
be
ready
for
Oklahoma
.

Monday
,
he
had
four
Longhorns
in
the
top
four
.

Meek
expressed
particular
gratification
at
the
defensive
performances
of
end
Happy
Nelson
and
halfback
Billy
Gannon
.

He'll
be
out
of
action
all
this
week
.

He's
looking
a
lot
better
,
and
he's
able
to
run
,
Meek
explained
.

We'll
work
out
about
an
hour
on
Saturday
,
then
we'll
work
Monday
and
Tuesday
of
next
week
,
then
taper
off
.

Rabb
,
the
former
Louisiana
State
field
general
,
came
off
the
bench
for
his
debut
with
the
Bills
Sunday
and
directed
his
new
team
to
a
22-12
upset
victory
over
the
Houston
Oilers
,
defending
league
champions
.

The
Texans
made
themselves
a
comforting
break
on
the
opening
kickoff
when
Denver's
Al
Carmichael
was
jarred
loose
from
the
ball
when
Dave
Grayson
,
the
speedy
halfback
,
hit
him
and
Guard
Al
Reynolds
claimed
it
for
Dallas
.

The
early
Southwest
Conference
football
leaders
--
Texas
,
Arkansas
and
Texas
A
&
M
--
made
a
big
dent
in
the
statistics
last
week
.

Completing
12
of
15
passes
for
174
yards
,
the
Aggies
had
a
total
offense
of
361
yards
.

Rookie
Ron
Nischwitz
continued
his
pinpoint
pitching
Monday
night
as
the
Bears
made
it
two
straight
over
Indianapolis
,
5-3
.

Jay
Porter
drew
a
base
on
balls
to
fill
the
bases
but
Don
Wert's
smash
was
knocked
down
by
Rudolph
for
the
putout
.

Nischwitz
was
working
on
a
3-hitter
when
the
Indians
bunched
three
of
their
eight
hits
for
two
runs
in
the
sixth
.

It
was
the
season's
first
night
game
and
an
obvious
refocusing
of
the
lights
are
in
order
.

with
the
winning
run
with
two
out
in
the
last
of
the
ninth
to
give
the
Minnesota
Twins

Examiner
went
to
his
compartment
to
talk
with
him
.

He's
mad
at
the
world
.

I
told
him
who
I
was
and
he
was
quite
cold
.

But
he
warmed
up
after
a
while
.

I
told
him
what
Liston
had
said
and
he
said
Liston
was
a
double-crosser
and
said
anything
he
(
Liston
)
got
was
through
a
keyhole
.

Just
when
it
seems
baseball
might
be
losing
its
grip
on
the
masses
up
pops
heroics
to
start
millions
of
tongues
to
wagging
.

And
so
it
was
over
the
weekend
what
with
40-year-old
Warren
Spahn
pitching
his
no-hit
masterpiece
against
the
Giants
and
the
Giants'
Willie
Mays
retaliating
with
a
record-tying
4-homer
spree
Sunday
.

Yes
,
with
Bob
Grove
,
Carl
Hubbell
,
Herb
Pennock
,
Art
Nehf
,
Vernon
Gomez
,
et
al
.

The
spectacular
Mays
,
who
reaches
a
decade
in
the
big
leagues
come
May
25
,
joined
six
other
sluggers
who
walloped
four
home
runs
in
a
span
of
nine
innings
.

The
record
books
,
however
,
would
favor
the
Giants'
ace
.

In
four
of
his
nine
previous
seasons
Mays
hit
as
many
as
25
home
runs
and
stole
as
many
as
25
bases
.

Once
the
figure
was
30-30
.

There
are
two
more
Sunday
afternoons
when
the
situation
will
arise
.

It
is
an
irritable
rule
that
does
baseball
more
harm
than
good
,
especially
at
the
minor
league
level
.

--
The
powerful
New
York
Yankees
won
their
19th
world
series
in
a
5-game
romp
over
outclassed
Cincinnati
,
crushing
the
Reds
in
a
humiliating
13-5
barrage
Monday
in
the
loosely
played
finale
.

With
Mickey
Mantle
and
Yogi
Berra
both
out
of
action
due
to
injuries
,
the
American
League
champs
still
mounted
a
15-hit
attack
against
a
parade
of
eight
Cincinnati
pitchers
,
the
most
ever
used
by
one
team
in
a
series
game
.

Hector
Lopez
,
subbing
for
Berra
,
smashed
a
3-run
homer
off
Bill
Henry
during
another
5-run
explosion
in
the
fourth
.

The
Yanks
also
took
advantage
of
three
Cincinnati
errors
.

The
crowd
of
32,589
had
only
two
chances
to
applaud
.

In
the
third
Frank
Robinson
hammered
a
long
home
run
deep
into
the
corner
of
the
bleachers
in
right
center
,
about
400
feet
away
,
with
two
men
on
.

Only
Bucky
Harris
,
the
boy-manager
of
Washington
in
1924
,
and
Eddie
Dyer
of
the
St.
Louis
Cardinals
in
1946
had
accomplished
the
feat
.

Philadelphia
,
Jan.
23

Philadelphia
permitted
him
to
seek
a
better
connection
after
he
had
refused
to
reconsider
his
decision
to
end
his
career
as
a
player
.

He
began
his
coaching
career
at
Pittsburgh
Central
Catholic
High
School
in
1949
.

He
was
there
one
season
before
rejoining
the
Steelers
as
an
assistant
coach
.

Shaw
and
Skorich
headed
a
group
of
players
,
coaches
and
team
officials
who
received
an
engrossed
copy
of
an
official
city
citation
and
a
pair
of
silver
cufflinks
shaped
like
a
football
.

Flushing
stadium
in
works

The
New
York
franchise
is
headed
by
Mrs.
Charles
Shipman
Payson
.

Palmer
,
golf's
leading
money-winner
in
1960
,
and
Snead
will
be
saluted
as
the
winning
team
in
the
Canada
Cup
matches
last
June
in
Dublin
.

It
was
neither
a
spirit
of
self-sacrifice
nor
a
yen
to
encourage
the
downtrodden
that
motivated
Arnold
.

He
merely
became
victimized
by
a
form
of
athletics
that
respects
no
one
and
aggravates
all
.

Willie's
partner
was
Long
Jim
Barnes
,
who
tried
to
keep
count
.

A
formula
to
supply
players
for
the
new
Minneapolis
Vikings
and
the
problem
of
increasing
the
1961
schedule
to
fourteen
games
will
be
discussed
by
National
Football
League
owners
at
a
meeting
at
the
Hotel
Warwick
today
.

However
,
this
would
require
a
lengthening
of
the
season
from
thirteen
to
fourteen
weeks
.

Nine
of
the
league's
teams
play
in
baseball
parks
and
therefore
face
an
early-season
conflict
in
dates
.

Solly
Hemus
announced
a
switch
in
his
starting
pitcher
,
from
Bob
Gibson
to
Ernie
Broglio
,
for
several
reasons
:
1
Broglio's
4-0
won-lost
record
and
1.24
earned-run
mark
against
Pittsburgh
a
year
ago
;
;

2
The
desire
to
give
Broglio
as
many
starts
as
possible
;
;

Lindy
McDaniel
threw
batting
practice
about
25
minutes
,
and
he
looked
good
,
Hemus
said
.

He
should
be
getting
back
in
the
groove
before
long
.

The
statistics
hardly
indicated
that
the
Pirates
needed
extra
batting
practice
,
but
Murtaugh
also
turned
his
men
loose
at
Busch
Stadium
yesterday
.

We
are
getting
Friend
some
runs
for
a
change
,
and
he
has
been
pitching
good
,
Murtaugh
said
.

A
year
later
they
were
4-13
.

The
club
that
overcame
the
worst
start
in
a
comparable
period
to
win
the
pennant
was
New
York's
'51
Giants
,
who
dropped
11
of
their
first
13
.

Benington
recalled
that
he
once
told
Hartweger
that
he
doubted
Gordon
would
ever
play
much
for
him
because
he
seemed
to
be
lacking
in
all
of
the
accepted
basketball
skills
.

After
the
coach
listed
all
the
boy's
faults
,
Hartweger
said
,
Coach
before
I
leave
here
,
you'll
get
to
like
me
.

Mrs.
Benington
admired
Gordon's
spirit
and
did
what
she
could
to
persuade
her
husband
that
the
boy
might
help
the
team
.

Bob
Burnes
,
sports
editor
of
the
Globe-Democrat
,
presented
Bob
Nordmann
with
his
award
.

On
the
clock
given
him
was
the
inscription
,
For
Outstanding
Contribution
to
Billiken
Basketball
,
1960-61
.

This
team
set
a
precedent
that
could
be
valuable
in
the
future
,
Benington
pointed
out
.

By
winning
against
Bradley
,
Kentucky
and
Notre
Dame
on
those
teams'
home
courts
,
they
showed
that
the
home
court
advantage
can
be
overcome
anywhere
and
that
it
doesn't
take
a
super
team
to
do
it
.

St.
Louis
University
found
a
way
to
win
a
baseball
game
.

Larry
Scherer
last
night
pitched
a
no-hit
game
,
said
to
be
the
first
in
Billiken
baseball
history
,
as
the
Blue
and
White
beat
Southeast
Missouri
State
College
,
5-1
,
at
Crystal
City
.

St.
Louis
U.
was
to
be
in
action
again
today
with
a
game
scheduled
at
4
against
Washington
University
at
Ligget
Field
.

For
that
matter
,
Stan
Musial
is
rare
,
possessing
the
disposition
that
enabled
him
to
put
out
the
same
for
seven
managers
,
reserving
his
opinions
,
but
not
his
effort
.

With
the
speed
and
power
of
the
body
beautiful
he
saw
before
him
,
Ol'
Case
wanted
No.
7
to
be
not
only
the
best
homerun
hitter
,
but
also
the
best
bunter
,
base-runner
and
outfielder
.

Willie's
wonderful
walloping
Sunday
--
four
home
runs
--
served
merely
to
emphasize
how
happy
he
is
to
be
playing
for
Alvin
Dark
.

In
the
small
group
will
be
the
junior
and
senior
Mrs.
Walter
Monroe
;
;

and
his
brother
,
Mr.
Wendell
Jr.
,
and
his
wife
,
who
will
arrive
from
Boston
.

The
bridegroom's
children
were
here
for
the
Christmas
holidays
and
can't
return
.

Mr.
Wendell
and
his
bride
will
live
in
his
Lake
Forest
house
.

The
New
York
Metropolitan
Opera
Company
will
be
here
in
May
,
and
the
board
will
sponsor
the
Saturday
night
,
May
13
,
performance
of
Turandot
as
a
benefit
.

A
small
reception
will
follow
in
the
Oak
Park
Arms
hotel
.

Mrs.
Hamm
will
not
come
from
Vero
Beach
,
Fla.
,
for
the
wedding
.

Later
,
a
bus
will
carry
members
to
the
Chicago
Stadium
to
see
Jack
Kramer's
professional
tennis
matches
at
8
p.m.
.

With
loud
huzzahs
for
the
artistic
success
of
the
Presbyterian-St.
Luke's
Fashion
show
still
ringing
in
her
ears
,
its
director
,
Helen
Tieken
Geraghty
(
Mrs.
Maurice
P.
Geraghty
)
is
taking
off
tomorrow
on
a
56
day
world
trip
which
should
earn
her
even
greater
acclaim
as
director
of
entertainment
for
next
summer's
International
Trade
fair
.

The
Richard
S.
Burkes'
home
in
Wayne
may
be
the
setting
for
the
wedding
reception
for
their
daughter
,
Helen
Lambert
,
and
the
young
Italian
she
met
last
year
while
studying
in
Florence
during
her
junior
year
at
Smith
college

If
W.

he
ain't

La
Russell's
run
in
Skylark
,
debuting
next

But
on
to

Johnny
Weissmuller
,
the

telephoned
Maureen
O'Sullivan
,
his

Me

this
Jane

Actually
Johnny
is
a
glib

garrulous
guy

with
a
rare
sense
of
humor

My
idea
of
masterful
movie
making
.

William

up

Mrs.
John
C.
Vroman

spending
several
days
in
her
Sherman

on
the
panel
of
the
Eastern
Women's
Liberal

College
panel
on
Wednesday
evening
in
the
Security
Life
Bldg.
.

Guests
were
juniors
in
the

is
the
former
Miss

Rickenbaugh
.

Her
position
covers
a
number
of
daily
tasks
common
to
any
social
director
.

The
Denverite
has
worked
out
an
entire
program
to
achieve
this
using
the
facilities
of
the
center
.

In
addition
to
the
tickets
to
the
movies
,
sporting
events
and
concerts
,
Mrs.
Marr
lines
up
candy
and
cookies
because
alcoholics
require
a

of
sweets
to
replace
the
sugar
in
their
system

By
July

,
six
weeks
from

,
motel-keepers

will
,
by
6
p.m.
,
be
switching
on
that
bleak

No
Vacancy

Ah
,
that
is
simple
.

Home
is
where
a
man
was
born
,
reared
,
went
to
school
and
,
most
particularly
,
where
grandma
is
.

There
are
motels
for
all
purposes
and
all
tastes
.

Innumerable
motels
from
Tucson
to
New

boast
swimming
pools
(
swim
at
your
own
risk
is
the
hospitable
sign
poised
at
the
brink
of
most
pools
)
.

Dr.
W.
B.
I.
Martin
officiated

and
the

We've
been
working
for
weeks
.

We
are
keeping
a
number
of
surprises
under
our
hats
.

It
is
just
bad
luck
that
we
are
having
the
party
in
a
month
with
no
R's
,
so
no
oysters
.

There
will
be
masses
of
flowers
,
reproductions
of
the
handsome
old
buildings
with
their
grillwork
and
other
things
that
are
typical
of
New
Orleans
.

Some
idea
of
the
competence
of
the
women
is
indicated
in
the
contribution
made
by
them
during
the
past
25
years
that
totals
$840,000

Louis
Glazer

The
event
is
the
sixth
on
the
annual
calendar
of
the
local
members
of
the
National
Council
of
Jewish
Women
.

It
originated
with
the
Wissahickon

Mrs.
Clayton
Nairne
,
whose
daughter
,
was

chose
a
deep

--
The
Anne
Arundel
county
school
superintendent
has
asked
that
the
Board
of
Education
return
to
the
practice
of
recording
its
proceedings
mechanically
so
that
there
will
be
no
more
question
about
who
said
what
.

The
proposal
was
made
by
Dr.
David
S.
Jenkins
after
he
and
Mrs.
D.
Ellwood
Williams
,
Jr.
,
a
board
member
and
long-time
critic
of
the
superintendent
,
argued
for
about
fifteen
minutes
at
this
week's
meeting
.

I
hate
to
have
these
things
come
up
again
and
again
,
Dr.
Jenkins
commented
as
he
made
his
suggestion
.

Doctors
at
the
hospital
said
he
was
partially
paralyzed
on
the
right
side
.

Police
said
he
became
ill
while
parked
in
front
of
a
barber
shop
at
229
West
Pratt
Street
.

Sent
home
for
rest

The
victims
were
H.
Malone
Dresbach
,
47
,
and
his
wife
,
Shirley
,
46
.

Younger
son
calls
police

Soon
after
10
A.M.
,
when
police
reached
the
brick
home
in
the
Franklin
Manor
section
,
15
miles
south
of
here
on
the
bay
,
in
response
to
a
call
from
the
Dresbach's
other
son
,
Lee
,
14
,
they
found
Mrs.
Dresbach's
body
on
the
first-floor
bedroom
floor
.

The
younger
son
told
police
his
brother
had
run
from
the
house
after
the
shootings
and

Five
held
for
trial

They
are
accused
of
whisking
secrets
out
of
naval
strongrooms
over
which
they
kept
guard
.

Of
highest
value

The
information
,
he
said
,
would
have
been
of
the
highest
value
to
a
potential
enemy
.

The
British
defending
lawyers
,
who
today
increased
from
three
to
four
,
demanded
to
know
if
they
could
make
the
information
involved
seem
of
little
value
to
a
jury
,
the
chances
of
their
clients
would
improve
.

The
United
States
offered
to
supply
a
complete
set
of
propelling
equipment
like
that
used
in
the
Skipjack
.

Range
was
a
vital
detail
.

The
charge
that
the
federal
indictment
of
three
Chicago
narcotics
detail
detectives
is
the
product
of
rumor
,
combined
with
malice
,
and
individual
enmity
on
the
part
of
the
federal
narcotics
unit
here
was
made
yesterday
in
their
conspiracy
trial
before
Judge
Joseph
Sam
Perry
in
federal
District
court
.

In
opening
,
D.
Arthur
Connelly
,
assistant
United
States
attorney
,
read
the
indictment
,
but
made
no
comments
.

Attorneys
for
the
eight
other
defendants
said
only
that
there
was
no
proof
of
their
clients'
guilt
.

Cooperman
and
Teller
are
accused
of
selling
$4,700
worth
of
heroin
to

,

of
6934
Indiana
Av.
.

When
51st
Street
was
reached
,
Robinson
related
,
he
stopped
the
bus
and
told
the
youths
he
was
going
to
call
the
CTA
supervisor
.

The
defendant
,
William
L.
Stickney

,
23
,
of
3211
Park
pl.
,
Evanston
,
who
pleaded
guilty
to
reckless
driving
,
also
was
ordered
by
Judge
James
Corcoran
to
attend
the
Evanston
traffic
school
each
Tuesday
night
for
one
month
.

Hengesbach
,
who
has
been
living
on
welfare
recently
,
said
he
hopes
to
rebuild
the
farm
which
was
settled
by
his
grandfather
in
Westphalia
,
27
miles
southwest
of
here
.

Hengesbach
has
been
living
in
Grand
Ledge
since
his
house
and
barn
were
burned
down
after
his
release
in
1958
.

Assistant
Prosecutor
Fred
Lewis
,
who
tried
both
the
Hengesbach
and
Pohl
cases
,
said
he
did
not
know
what
would
be
done
about
two
arson
charges
pending
against
Pohl
.

Walker
said
he
was
considering
filing
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
would
contend
that
the
verdict
was
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
that
there
were
several
errors
in
trial
procedure
.

There
also
were
reports
of
a
collection
at
the
County
Line
Elementary
School
,
3505o
Dequindre
,
which
has
been
attended
this
year
by
four
of
the
Kowalski
children
including
Christine
.

I
wasn't
sure
there
were
such
people
anywhere
in
the
world
.

I'll
need
more
than
a
single
day
to
find
the
words
to
properly
express
my
thanks
to
them
.

Commandeering
a
passing
car
,
Kimmell
pursued
the
fleeing
vehicle
,
but
lost
it
in

A
14-power
conference
on
Laos
should
then
meet
on
May

,
he
said
.

A
note
making
the
request
was
handed
to
U.S.
Ambassador
Winthrop
G.
Brown
.

There
was
no
confirmation
of
such

Havana
,
April
19
.

The
executions
took
place
at
dawn
only
a
few
hours
after
Havana
radio
announced
their
conviction
by
a
revolutionary
tribunal
at
Pinar
Del
Rio
,
where
the
executions
took
place
.

McNair
,
25
,
was
seized
March
20
with
four
Cubans
and
accused
of
trying
to
land
a
boatload
of
rifles
in
Pinar
Del
Rio
,
about
35
miles
from
Havana
.

So
many
Cubans
were
reported
being
swept
into
the
Castro
dragnet
that
the
massive
Sports
Palace
auditorium
and
at
least
one
hotel
were
converted
into
makeshift
jails
.

M.
Kegham
--
the
name
is
a
pseudynom
--
was
a
teacher
in
Bucharest
and
a
member
of
the
Armenian
Revolutionary
Federation
(
ARF
)
--
two
reasons
the
Communists
put
him
away
when
they
arrived
in
1945
.

Today
,
M.
Kegham
was
in
Detroit
,
en
route
to
join
his
wife
and
children
in
California
.

But
an
official
statement
adopted
by
the
33-man
Emory
board
at
its
annual
meeting
Friday
noted
that
state
taxing
requirements
at
present
are
a
roadblock
to
accepting
Negroes
.

The
statement
explained
that
under
the
Georgia
Constitution
and
state
law
,
tax-exempt
status
is
granted
to
educational
institutions
only
if
they
are
segregated
.

Emory
could
not
continue
to
operate
according
to
its
present
standards
as
an
institution
of
higher
learning
,
of
true
university
grade
,
and
meet
its
financial
obligations
,
without
the
tax-exemption
privileges
which
are
available
to
it
only
so
long
as
it
conforms
to
the
aforementioned
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
,
the
statement
said
.

Emory
is
affiliated
with
the
Methodist
Church
.

From
its
beginning
,
the
trustees'
statement
said
Friday
,
Emory
University
has
assumed
as
its
primary
commitment
a
dedication
to
excellence
in
Christian
higher
learning
.

As
a
private
institution
,
supported
by
generous
individuals
,
Emory
University
will
recognize
no
obligation
and
will
adopt
no
policy
that
would
conflict
with
its
purpose
to
promote
excellence
in
scholarship
and
Christian
education
.

'
intend
to
attend
'

However
,
three
of
the
managers
did
say
that
they
would
agree
to
attend
the
proposed
meeting
if
all
of
the
other
managers
decided
to
attend
.

The
COAHR
letter
comes
on
the
eve
of
a
large
gathering
of
theater
managers
and
owners
scheduled
to
begin
here
Sunday
.

Charles
A.
Black
,
COAHR
chairman
,
said
Friday
that
three
theater
representatives
had
agreed
to
meet
with
the
students
on
Oct.
31
but
had
failed
to
show
up
.

Friday's
letters
asked
for
a
Nov.
15
meeting
.

Failure
to
attend
the
meeting
or
explain
inability
to
attend
,
the
letters
said
,
would
be
considered
a
sign
of
indifference
.

Black
said
COAHR
hoped
to
be
able
to
integrate
the
theaters
without
taking
direct
action
,
but
we
are
pledged
to
using
every
legal
and
nonviolent
means
at
our
disposal

Georgia's
Department
of
Agriculture
is
intensifying
its
fire
ant
eradication
program
in
an
effort
to
stay
ahead
of

pest
.

This

At
the
rate
of

early
weeks

No

had
yet
been
received
,
however

Field
does
the
planning
for
the
machine
operations
and
fiscal
processes
and
the
adapting
of
the
data
processing
system
to
new
programs
as
they
are
made
necessary
by
legislative
and
policy
changes
.

He
pointed
out
to
the
commissioners
that
the
agency
was
literally
dependent
now
on
the
machine
processing
,
and
the
whole
wheels
of
the
agency
would
stop
if
it
broke
down
or
the
three
or
four
persons
directing
it
were
to
leave
.

Juras
said
he
insisted
Field
be
continued
on
a
consultant
basis
only
and
be
answerable
directly
to
the
administrator
of
the
agency
and
not
to
other
agencies
of
the
government
.

The
continued
operation
of
this
program
depends
on
having
his
service

him
as
saying

to
Salem
,
instead
of
crippling
the
agency
,
had
provided
an
avenue
to
correct

the
key
being
improved

Before

minutes

Stein
,
who

admitted
to
reporters
that
he
had
a
wide
acquaintance
with
crime
syndicate

.

Under
scrutiny
,
two
of
the
witnesses
said
,
were
payments
and
loans
to
Stein's
National
Maintenance
company
at

Madison

The
reading
,
which
has
been
watched
with
interest
since
Russia's
detonation
of
a
super
bomb
Monday
,
was
4
on
Tuesday
and
7
last
Saturday
,
a
level
far
below
the
danger
point
,
according
to
the
board
of
health
.

The
complaint
on
which
the
warrant
was
issued
was
filed
by
Leo
Blaber
,
an

The

was
discovered
after
Huff

Probably
the
hottest
thing
that
has
hit
the
Dallas
investment
community
in
years
was
the
Morton
Foods
stock
issue
,
which
was
sold
to
the
public
during
the
past
week
.

A
measure
of
how
hot
the
stock
was
,
can
be
found
in
what
happened
to
it
on
the
market
as
soon
as
trading
began
.

Indeed
,
from
the
moment
the
reports
of
the
coming
issue
first
started
circulating
in
Dallas
last
January
,
the
inquiries
and
demand
for
the
stock
started
building
up
.

We
subscribe
500

Morton
Foods
of

First
,
the
general
stock
market
has
been
boiling
upward
for
the
last
few
months
,
driving
stocks
of
all
kinds
up
.

And
third
,
the
potato
chip
industry
has
taken
on
the
flavor
of
a
growth
industry
in
the
public
mind
of
late
.

The
potato
chip
industry
these
days
is
growing
,
not
only
as
a
result
of
population
increase
and
public
acceptance
of
convenience
foods
,
but
also
because
of
a
combination
of
circumstances
that
has
led
to
growth
by
merger
.

Those
that
remain
are
those
that
were
headed
by
strong
executives
,
men
with
the
abilities
to
last
almost
30
years
in
the
competitive
survival
of
the
fittest
.

Now
,
if
Morton's
newest
product
,
a
corn
chip
known
as
Chip-o's
,
turns
out
to
sell
as
well
as
its
stock
did
,
the
stock
may
turn
out
to
be
worth
every
cent
of
the
prices
that
the
avid
buyers
bid
it
up
to
.

The
Murray
Co.
of
Texas
,
Inc.
,
originated
in
Dallas
in
1896
.

The
firm
recently
expanded
domestic
sales
into
the
Southeastern
states
as
a
result
of
an
agreement
with
Cen-Tennial
Gin
Co.
.

In
1930
,
they
began
making
cotton
processing
equipment
.

The
firm
is
prominent
in
making
equipment
for
cleaning
seed
cotton
,
driers
,
and
heaters
,
and
they
lay
claim
to
being
the
first
maker
(
1910
)
of
boil
extraction
equipment
.

The
increase
in
mechanical
harvesting
of
cotton
makes
cleaning
and
drying
equipment
a
must
for
modern
gin
operation
.

The
firm
began
operations
back
in
1925
and
sells
equipment
in
the
central
cotton
belt
,
including
the
Mississippi
Delta
.

Cotton
processing
equipment
is
a
sizable
segment
of
Dallas
business
economy
.

On
a
quarter-to-quarter
comparison
,
the
first
quarter
of
1961
total
of
9,273
cars
was
21
per
cent
behind
the
previous
year's
3-month
total
of
11,744
.

Only
three
standard
models
--
Buick
,
Chrysler
,
and
Mercury
--
had
slight
year-to-year
gains
in
March
sales
in
the
county
.

The
Kennedy
administration's
new
housing
and
urban
renewal
proposals
,
particularly
their
effect
on
the
Federal
Housing
Administration
,
came
under
fire
in
Dallas
last
week
.

He
urged
support
for
President
Kennedy's
requests
for
both
defense
and
foreign
aid
appropriations
.

Sprinkel
told
conferees
that
the
recent
improvement
in
economic
activity
was
not
a
temporary
flash
in
the
pan
but
the
beginning
of
a
substantial
cyclical
expansion
that
will
carry
the
economy
back
to
full
employment
levels
and
witness
a
renewal
of
our
traditional
growth
pattern
.

While
he
declined
to
suggest
,
how
,
he
said
that
sooner
or
later
we
must
get
rid
of
Castro
,
for
unless
we
do
we
are
liable
to
face
similar
situations
in
this
hemisphere
.

Of
1,253
issues
traded
,
695
advanced
and
354
declined
.

New
highs
for
the
year
totaled
nine
and
new
lows
14
.

The
executive
paid
tribute
to
research
and
development
and
technology
for
their
great
contributions
in
the
past
,
but
he
also
cautioned
industry
that
they
tend
to
be
great
equalizers
because
they
move
at
a
fairly
even
pace
within
an
industry
and
fail
to
give
it
the
short-term
advantage
which
it
often
needs
.

He
also
used
as
an
example
the
manufacturer
who
introduced
an
all-automatic
camera
in
Germany
,
with
the
result
that
it
became
the
best
selling
camera
in
the
German
market
.

Election
of
Howard
L.
Taylor
to
membership
in

P.
Phelan
,
president
of
the

.

Gulf's

could
have
been

into
2,700,877
shares
of
Union
Oil
common
upon
surrender
of
debentures
plus
cash
,
according
to
Union
.

The
convertible
debentures
are
convertible
into
common
shares
at
$65
a
share
by
June
1
,
1966
;
;

$70
by
1971
;
;

Fairchild
Camera
and
Kawecki
Chemical
gained
each
.

But
it
seems
that
this
electronic
brain
wasn't
programmed
correctly
.

At
that
time
,
the
people
at
the
bank
said
they
felt
that
they
had
the
situation
in
hand
.

The
railroad
president
made
the
statement
in
an
interview
as
the
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
opened
Round
2
of
its
hearing
into
the
C
&
O's
request
to
control
and
then
merge
with
the
B
&
Aj
.

All
these
kind
of
things
weaken
us
,
Perlman
said
.

The
industry
has
said
1960
was
a
poor
year
.

Though
the
sales
gains
these
two
dealers
are
experiencing
are
above
average
for
their
business
,
farm
equipment
sales
are
climbing
in
most
rural
areas
.

Fields
of
corn
and
some
other
crops
in
many
cases
are
so
dense
that
older
equipment
cannot
handle
them
efficiently
.

Seven
of
the
eight
companies
that
turn
out
full
lines
of
farm
machinery
say
sales
by
their
dealers
since
the
start
of
August
have
shown
gains
averaging
nearly
10%
above
last
year
.

In
August
our
dealers
sold
13%
more
farm
machinery
than
a
year
earlier
and
in
September
retail
sales
were
14%
higher
than
last
year
,
says
Mark
V.
Keeler
,
farm
equipment
vice
president
of
International
Harvester
Co.
.

The
significance
of
the
pickup
in
farm
machinery
sales
extends
beyond
the
farm
equipment
industry
.

Farmers
are
so
eager
for
new
machinery
that
they
are
haggling
less
over
prices
than
they
did
a
year
ago
,
dealers
report
.

This
morning
,
we
allowed
a
farmer
$600
on
the
old
picker
he
traded
in
on
a
new
$2,700
model
.

in
August
of
1960
,
he
sold
seven
.

For
example
,
farm
equipment
shipments
of
International
Harvester
in
August
climbed
about
5%
above
a
year
earlier
,
Mr.
Keeler
reports
.

Tractor
production
at
Massey-Ferguson
,
Ltd.
,
of
Toronto
in
July
and
August
rose
to
2,418
units
from
869
in
the
like
period
a
year
earlier
,
says
John
Staiger
,
vice
president
.

With
the
lower
dealer
inventories
and
the
stepped-up
demand
some
manufacturers
believe
there
could
be
shortages
of
some
implements
.

Merritt
D.
Hill
,
Ford
Motor
Co.
vice
president
,
says
his
company
is
starting
to
get
calls
daily
from
dealers
demanding
immediate
delivery
or
wanting
earlier
shipping
dates
on
orders
for
corn
pickers
.

The
rise
in
sales
last
winter
was
checked
when
the
Government's
new
feed
grain
program
was
adopted
;
;

The
Government
also
is
aiding
farmers'
income
prospects
.

Net
income
may
reach
$12.7
billion
,
up
$1
billion
from
1960
and
the
highest
since
1953
.

The
measure
allows
such
companies
in
those
years
to
apply
their
mineral
depletion
allowances
to
50%
of
the
value
of
the
finished
products
rather
than
the
lower
value
of
raw
clay
alone
.

A
rule
on
the
Federal
deductibility
of
state
taxes
is
contested
.

The
owner
of
a
public
relations
firm
owed
no
income
tax
on
payments
he
received
from
a
client
company
and
kicked
back
to
the
company's
advertising
manager
,
the
Tax
Court
ruled
.

The
Court
upheld
the
taxpayer's
contention
that
these
kickbacks
were
not
his
income
though
they
passed
through
his
hands
.

A
spouse
employed
by
a
corporation
her
husband
controls
,
for
example
,
may
be
entitled
to
distributions
under
the
company's
pension
plan
as
well
as
to
her
own
Social
Security
coverage
.

She
would
be
taxed
on
the
pensions
when
received
,
of
course
,
but
the
company's
contributions
would
be
tax-free
.

In
that
event
,
they
note
,
the
Revenue
Service
might
declare
the
pension
plan
is
discriminatory
and
deny
it
tax
privileges
under
the
law
.

She

Now

,
at

she
feels
she
is

whole

And
there
she

Getting
to
and
from
school
was
no
problem
.

One
might
think
the
problem
would
be
similar
.

They
could
walk
,
ride
on
a
bus
or
be
driven
.

This
is
a
way
of
getting
to
school
,
but
,
I
understand
,
it
entails
a
certain
loss
of
social
status
.

A
young
man
doesn't
like
to
be
driven
up
in
front
of
a
school
in
a
car
driven
by
a
girl
who
isn't
even
in
a
higher
class
than
he
is
,
and
is
also
a
girl
.

My
father
walked
,
through
two
miles
of
snow
,
in
Illinois
.

Did
you
?
?

I
feel
a
certain
loss
of
status
when
I
am
driven
up
in
front
of
work
in
a
car
driven
by
my
wife
,
who
is
only
a
woman
.

They
say
that
when
they
take
a
car
,
Gloriana
doesn't
take
her
car
,
but
rides
with
them
.

But
that's
hardly
realistic
.

Nobody
walks
anymore
but
crackpots

he's
already
got
an
education

Here's
an
idea
for
a
child's
room
that
is
easy
to
execute
and
is
completely
charming
,
using
puppets
for
lamp
bases
.

Most
children
love
the
animated
puppet
faces
and
their
flexible
bodies
,
and
they
prefer
to
see
them
as
though
the
puppets
were
in
action
,
rather
than
put
away
in
boxes
.

Make
sure
that
the
metal
tube
through
which
the
wire
passes
is
in
the
shape
of
an
inverted
L
,
the
foot
of
the
L
about
three
inches
long
,
so
that
the
puppet
can
hang
directly
under
the
light
.

Using
the
strings
that
manipulate
the
puppet
,
suspend
him
from
the
light
fixture
by
tying
the
strings
to
the
lamp
base
.

In
the
background
lurked
the
feeling
,
however
,
that
these
pieces
,
beautiful
as
they
were
,
lacked
the
utilitarian
touch
.

More
than
300
teenagers
last
Sunday
proved
there
is
and
as

more
are
expected
to
prove
it
again
for
Jim
Kern
and
his
wife
Lynn
from
4

8
p.m.
Sunday
at
First
Presbyterian
Church
.

Kern
began
reading
a
lot
about
the
history
and
philosophy
of
Communism
,
but
never
felt
there
was
anything
he
,
as
an
individual
,
could
do
about
it
.

When
you
stand
up

take
vows
to
strive
to
set
an
example
before
your
children

to
teach
them
the

you
strive
a
little
harder
to
uphold
those
vows
,

During
his
five-month
visit
abroad
,
Jorda
recently
conducted
the
Orchestre
Philharmonique
De
Bordeau
in
France
,
and
the
Santa
Cecilia
Orchestra
in
Rome
.

In
announcing
Jorda's
return
,
the
orchestra
also
announced
that
the
sale
of
single
tickets
for
the
50th
anniversary
season
will
start
at
the
Sherman
Clay
box
office
on
Wednesday

The
Leningrad
Kirov
Ballet
,
which
opened
a
series
of
performances
Friday
night
at
the
Opera
House
,
is
,
I
think
,
the
finest
classical
ballet
company
I
have
ever
seen
,
and
the
production
of
the
Petipa-Tschaikowsky
Sleeping
Beauty
with
which
it
began
the
series
is
incomparably
the
finest
I
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
.

In
other
words
,
no
merely
male
creature
can
resist
that
corps
de
ballet
.

Irina
Kolpakova
,
the
Princess
Aurora
of
Friday's
performance
,
would
be
a
change
for
the
better
anywhere
,
at
any
time
,
no
matter
who
had
had
the
role
before
.

Mail
orders
are
now
being
received
for
the
series
of
concerts
to
be
given
this
season
under
the
auspices
of
the
San
Francisco
Chamber
Music
Society
.

Participating
members
may
attend
five
of
the
concerts
for
$9
(
not
all
ten
concerts
as
was
erroneously
announced
earlier
in
The
Chronicle
)
.

They
will
be
accepted
at
all
branches
of
the
Bay
View
Federal
Savings
and
Loan
Association
,
at
a
collection
center
in
the

So
I
went
to
see
La
Dolce
Vita
.

If
that's
all
the
Romans
did
,
it's
a
surprise
to
me
that
Rome
fell
.

I
cannot
imagine
a
single
scene
that
isn't
done
in
a
far
naughtier
manner
on
TV
every
week
.

a
frigid
beauty
,
and
three
silly
fairies
.

As
A
moral
shocker
it
is
a
dud
.

according
to
a

from
Dr.
Robert
C.

.

With
a
foreign

you
must
wear

Asked
the
gas

man
.

The
present
crop
of
small
cars
is
enriching
American
humor
.

Gas
station
people
are
very
debonair
about
small
cars
.

When
I
had
my
big
job
with
the
double
headlights
and
yards
of
chrome
,
the
gas
people
were
happy
to
see
me
.

Tires
OK
?
?

Check
the
oil
and
water
,
sir
?
?

They
polished
the
windshield
.

They
had
a
loving
touch
.

About
35
.

Dollar
bills
skidded
off
my
hands
and
they
tipped
their
caps
politely
.

Mrs.
Lenygon's
committee
associates
,
announced
formally
yesterday
by
the
AID
in
New
York
,
include
Mrs.
Allen
Lehman
McCluskey
and
Stephen
J.
Jussel
,
both
wellknown
Manhattan
decorators
.

After
paying
tribute
to
the
conductor
and
his
white-clad
youthful
students
,
President
Kennedy
said
,
As
an
American
I
have
the
greatest
possible
pride
in
the
work
that
is
being
done
in
dozens
of
schools
stretching
across
the
United
States
--
schools
where
devoted
teachers
are
studying
with
interested
young
men
and
women
and
opening
up
the
whole
wide
horizon
of
serious
music
.

The
nuns
there
do
a
wonderful
work
,
the
President
commented
.

And
it
turned
out
to
be
more
of
a
family
affair
than
expected
.

Transylvania
Symphony
Conductor
Pfohl
said
yesterday
that
Mrs.
Kennedy's
Social
Secretary
,
Letitia
Baldrige
,
told
about
plans
for
White
House
youth
concerts
before
the
National
Symphony
Orchestra
League
in
Philadelphia
last
spring
.

A
flow
of
correspondence
between
Pfohl
and
Miss
Baldrige
resulted
in
an
invitation
to
the
85-student
North
Carolina
group
to
play
the
first
concert
.

I
was
an
art
major
in
college
,
Miss
Baldrige
explained
.

She
turned
out
to
be
a
fan
,
too
,
of
Margaret
Bouton
,
the
Gallery's
associate
curator
of
education
.

The
Brevard
group
of
85
arrived
at
the
Gallery
at
6
p.m.
,
remaining
for
about
45
minutes
.

They
decided
that
they
thought
Rembrandt's
self-portrait
made
him
look
sad
;
;

He
pointed
out
to
the
young
musicians
that
the
National
Gallery
is
the
only
museum
in
the
country
to
have
a
full-time
music
director
,
Richard
Bales
.

A
reception
and
tea
followed
.

Without
any
definite
plan
in
mind
,
she
went
to
a
judge
to
see
what
could
be
done
.

The
interviews
have
led
each
of
them
to
a
new
appreciation
of
the
problems
confronting
the
other
.

John
received
a
promotion
in
his
firm
.

He
gives
credit
for
the
promotion
to
his
new
outlook
on
life
.

To
outsiders
,
the
Blacks
seem
to
be
an
ordinary
,
happy
family
,
and
they
are
--
but
with
a
difference
.

They
know
the
value
of
being
just
that
--
an
ordinary
,
happy
family
.

Family
Service
could
not
open
its
doors
to
a
single
family
without
the
financial
support
of
the
United
Givers
Fund
.

Mr.
Kennedy
replied
:

He
wanted
to
buy
time
to
strengthen
the
U.
S.
and
its
allies
and
to
define
and
begin
to
implement
his
foreign
policy
.

The
first
time
was
in
1955
when
a
full-dress
Big
Four
summit
meeting
produced
the
spirit
of
Geneva
.

Premier
Khrushchev
wrecked
the
conference
at
its
initial
session
with
a
bitter
denunciation
of
the
U.
S.
for
the
U-2
incident
.

The
episode
tended
to
confirm
the
U.
S.
belief
that
propaganda
,
the
hope
of
one-sided
concessions
,
and
the
chance
to
split
the
Allies
,
rather
than
genuine
negotiation
,
were
the
Soviet
leader's
real
aims
in
summitry
.

As
long
as
Mr.
Khrushchev
is
convinced
that
the
balance
of
world
power
is
shifting
his
way
,
no
amount
of
either
smiles
or
toughness
,
neither
Camp
David
talks
nor
kitchen
debates
,
can
compel
him
to
enter
fruitful
negotiations
.

The
President
had
set
for
himself
the
task
,
which
he
believed
vital
,
of
awakening
the
U.
S.
and
its
allies
to
the
hard
and
complex
effort
necessary
to
shift
that
balance
.

Above
all
,
he
did
not
want
to
appear
to
be
running
hat
in
hand
to
Premier
Khrushchev's
doorstep
.

In
the
U.
S.
,
strong
pressures
have
been
building
up
for
a
resumption
of
tests
on
grounds
that
the
Russians
may
be
secretly
testing
.

In
Laos
,
the
picture
was
almost
equally
bad
.

In
the
light
of
those
events
,
there
appeared
to
be
a
real
danger
that
Premier
Khrushchev
might
overreach
himself
.

He
has
indicated
that
he
plans
new
moves
on
Berlin
before
the
year
is
out
.

The
President
and
his
advisers
felt
that
the
time
might
have
come
to
warn
Premier
Khrushchev
against
a
grave
miscalculation
in
areas
such
as
Berlin
,
Iran
or
Latin
America
from
which
there
would
be
no
turning
back
.

The
response
from
London
,
Paris
and
Bonn
was
favorable
.

The
Washington
announcement
said
:

The
Vienna
meeting
will
bring
together
a
seasoned
,
67-year-old
veteran
of
the
cold
war
who
,
in
Mr.
Kennedy's
own
words
,
is
shrewd
,
tough
,
vigorous
,
well-informed
and
confident
,
and
a
44-year-old
President
(
his
birthday
is
May
29
)
with
a
demonstrated
capacity
for
political
battle
but
little
experience
in
international
diplomacy
.

The
feeling
was
that
he
would
sense
an
inner
core
of
toughness
and
determination
in
the
President
and
that
plain
talk
by
Mr.
Kennedy
would
give
him
pause
.

This
time
the
initiative
came
,
in
part
at
least
,
from
Washington
.

There
is
no
single
issue
that
has
aroused
stronger
feelings
throughout
the
world
.

The
shell
,
which
served
the
strain
so
well
at
a
relatively
early
stage
in
the
evolutionary
scheme
,
tended
to
cancel
out
the
possibility
of
future
development
.

Though
this
may
or
may
not
be
good
biology
,
it
does
aptly
illustrate
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
American
Catholic
higher
education
.

By
way
of
explanation
we
ourselves
are
prone
to
imagine
that
this
achievement
stems
from
the
same
American
Catholic
zeal
and
generosity
which
brought
the
parochial
school
system
into
existence
.

There
is
,
however
,
one
curious
discrepancy
in
this
broad
and
flattering
picture
.

Viewing
the
American
Catholic
educational
achievement
in
retrospect
,
we
may
indeed
see
it
as
a
unified
whole
extending
from
grade
school
to
university
.

Yet
for
better
or
for
worse
,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
most
American
Catholic
colleges
do
not
owe
their
existence
to
general
Catholic
support
but
rather
to
the
initiative
,
resourcefulness
and
sacrifices
of
individual
religious
communities
.

The
net
result
is
a
uniquely
satisfying
sense
of
comradeship
,
the
kind
of
comradeship
which
sparks
enthusiasm
and
blunts
the
cutting
edge
of
sacrifice
and
hardship
.

American
Catholic
colleges
and
universities
are
,
in
a
very
real
sense
,
the
product
of
private
enterprise
--
the
private
enterprise
of
religious
communities
.

I
think
for
example
of
three
women's
colleges
with
pitifully
small
enrollments
,
clustered
within
a
few
miles
of
a
major
Catholic
university
,
which
is
also
co-educational
.

Commenting
on
the
earlier
stage
,
the
Notre
Dame
Chapter
of
the
American
Association
of
University
Professors
(
in
a
recent
report
on
the
question
of
faculty
participation
in
administrative
decision-making
)
noted
that
the
term
teacher-employee
(
as
opposed
to
,
e.g.
,
maintenance
employee
)
was
a
not
inapt
description
.

And
while
no
one
expects
total
democracy
on
the
academic
scene
,
the
scholar
will
be
particularly
sensitive
to
a
line
between
first
and
second
class
citizenship
drawn
on
any
basis
other
than
that
of
academic
rank
or
professional
achievement
.

It
is
natural
that
he
should
turn
for
his
major
support
to
a
select
and
dedicated
few
from
the
organization
which
actually
owns
the
university
and
whose
goals
are
,
in
their
opinion
,
identified
with
its
highest
good
and
(
to
use
that
oft-repeated
phrase
)
'
the
attainment
of
excellence
'
.

The
pattern
here
pictured
is
clearly
not
peculiar
to
Notre
Dame
:
it
is
simply
that
the
paradox
involved
in
this
kind
of
control
of
the
institution
by
the
organization
which
actually
owns
it
,
becomes
more
obvious
where
there
is
a
larger
and
more
distinguished
outside
faculty
.

There
are
two
reasons
why
failure
to
come
to
grips
with
this
demand
could
be
fatal
to
the
future
of
the
Catholic
university
.

This
is
a
significant
advance
but
its
import
should
not
be
exaggerated
.

There
is
no
need
here
to
spell
out
the
conditions
of
creative
teaching
except
to
point
out
that
,
at
the
college
level
,
the
sense
of
community
and
of
community
responsibility
is
even
more
necessary
than
it
is
at
other
levels
.

But
this
in
turn
means
that
decisions
are
not
merely
imposed
from
the
top
but
that
there
be
some
actual
mechanism
of
faculty
participation
.

Competent
teachers
are
well
versed
in
the
technique
of
leading
students
to
pre-set
conclusions
without
destroying
the
students'
illusion
that
they
are
making
their
own
decisions
.

The
public
atmosphere
that
has
been
generated
which
makes
acceptance
of
this
law
a
possibility
stems
from
the
disrepute
into
which
the
labor
movement
has
fallen
as
a
result
of
Mr.
McClellan's
hearings
into
corruption
in
labor-management
relations
and
,
later
,
into
the
jurisdictional
squabbles
that
plagued
industrial
relations
at
the
missile
sites
.

The
Senator
was
shocked
by
stoppages
over
allegedly
trivial
disputes
that
delayed
our
missile
program
.

It
is
now
disclosed
that
the
taxpayer
not
only
pays
for
high
wages
,
but
he
pays
the
employers'
strike
expenses
when
the
latter
undertakes
to
fight
a
strike
.

Rep.
Frank
Kowalski
of
Connecticut
has
brought
this
problem
to
the
attention
of
the
Armed
Services
Committee
.

The
problem
becomes
even
more
complex
where
an
enterprise
is
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
a
wide
variety
of
other
goods
in
addition
to
the
heavy
electrical
equipment
.

Accounting
procedures
can
be
varied
to
provide
a
rationale
for
almost
any
price
.

Should
these
giants
really
flex
their
competitive
muscles
,
they
would
become
the
only
survivors
in
the
industry
.

Uncle
Sam
would
then
accuse
them
of
creating
a
monopoly
by
unfair
competition
.

Engaging
in
such
a
conspiracy
was
an
act
of
mercy
by
the
giants
.

The
question
might
be
asked
:
Don't
the
managements
of
the
heavy-electrical-goods
manufacturers
know
these
facts
?
?

(
P.
215
)
when
corporate
abuses
were
attacked
,
it
was
done
on
the
theory
that
criminal
penalties
would
be
invoked
rather
than
control
.

In
this
manner
,
every
scheme
for
direct
control
broke
to
pieces
on
the
great
protective
rock
of
the
anti-trust
laws
.

A
secret
conspiracy
of
manufacturers
is
hardly
such
a
vehicle
.

However
,
one
can
argue
that
no
such
control
is
necessary
as
long
as
one
pretends
that
the
anti-trust
laws
are
effective
and
rational
.

If
a
union
cannot
perform
this
function
,
then
collective
bargaining
is
being
palmed
off
by
organizers
as
a
gigantic
fraud
.

The
problem
must
be
faced
squarely
.

Human
labor
was
exactly
that
--
a
commodity
--
in
eighteenth-
and
nineteenth-century
America
.

As
early
as
1776
,
Adam
Smith
wrote
in
The
Wealth
Of
Nations
:
We
have
no
acts
of
Parliament
against
combining
to
lower
the
price
of
work
;
;

Without
any
officious
and
improper
interference
on
the
subject
,
the
price
of
labor
or
the
wages
of
mechanics
will
be
regulated
by
the
demand
for
the
manufactured
article
and
the
value
of
that
which
is
paid
for
it
;
;

Compare
this
statement
of
a
nineteenth-century
judge
with
how
Congressman
Martin
,
according
to
the
Daily
Labor
Report
of
Sept.
19
,
1961
,
defends
the
necessity
of
enacting
anti-trust
legislation
in
the
field
of
labor
if
we
wish
to
prevent
monopolistic
fixing
of
wages
,
production
or
prices
and
if
we
wish
to
preserve
the
freedom
of
the
employer
and
his
employees
to
contract
on
wages
,
hours
and
conditions
of
employment
.

His
bill
,
allegedly
aimed
at
Hoffa
,
would
amend
the
Sherman
,
Clayton
and
Norris-LaGuardia
acts
to
authorize
the
issuance
of
federal
injunctions
in
any
transportation
strike
and
would
make
it
illegal
for
any
union
to
act
in
concert
with
any
other
union
--
even
a
sister
local
in
the
same
international
.

for
example
,
the
organization
of
steamship
conferences
to
set
freight
rates
and
the
encouragement
of
railroads
to
seek
mergers
.

At
the
very
moment
that
every
attempt
is
being
made
to
take
management
out
from
under
the
irrationality
of
anti-trust
legislation
,
a
drive
is
on
to
abolish
collective
bargaining
under
the
guise
of
extending
the
anti-monopoly
laws
to
unions
who
want
no
more
than
to
continue
to
set
wages
in
the
same
way
that
ship
operators
set
freight
rates
.

Through
Secretary
Herter
,
Ike
offered
President-elect
Kennedy
an
opportunity
to
associate
his
new
Administration
with
the
breakoff
decision
.

In
view
of
the
present
situation
in
Laos
,
said
the
Pentagon's
announcement
,
we
are
taking
normal
precautionary
actions
to
increase
the
readiness
of
our
forces
in
the
Pacific
.

Cutting
short
a
holiday
at
Hong
Kong
,
the
aircraft
carriers
Lexington
and
Bennington
steamed
off
into
the
South
China
Sea
,
accompanied
by
a
swarm
of
destroyers
,
plus
troopships
loaded
with
marines
.

Political
,
economic
and
military
experts
were
all
agreed
that
chaotic
,
mountainous
little
Laos
was
the
last
place
in
the
world
to
fight
a
war
--
and
they
were
probably
right
.

The
late
Secretary
of
State
John
Foster
Dulles
considered
the
1954
Geneva
agreement
a
specimen
of
appeasement
,
saw
that
resolution
would
be
needed
to
keep
it
from
becoming
a
calamity
for
the
West
.

Soviet
Premier
Khrushchev
sent
New
Year's
hopes
for
peace
to
President-elect
Kennedy
,
and
got
a
cool
acknowledgment
in
reply
.

This
time
,
they
were
much
better
prepared
and
organized
,
and
the
political
climate
was
favorable
.

They
had
the
unspoken
support
of
President-elect
Kennedy
,
whose
own
legislative
program
was
menaced
by
the
Rules
Committee
bottleneck
.

A
dour
,
gangling
man
with
a
choppy
gait
,
Colmer
looks
younger
than
his
70
years
,
has
gradually
swung
from
a
moderate
,
internationalist
position
to
that
of
a
diehard
conservative
.

Reprisals
are
not
unheard
of
in
such
situations
,
but
the
recent
tendency
has
been
for
the
Congress
to
forgive
its
prodigal
sons
.

Said
he
:
We
will
see
whether
whites
and
Negroes
are
treated
the
same
around
here
.

Sitting
quietly
on
an
equally
big
pork
barrel
was
another
Judge
Smith
ally
,
Georgia's
Carl
Vinson
,
chairman
of
the
Armed
Services
Committee
.

As
the
battle
raged
in
the
cloakrooms
and
caucuses
,
it
became
clear
that
Judge
Smith
could
lose
.

)
In
all
three
arenas
,
they
seemed
certain
of
victory
--
especially
with
Sam
Rayburn
applying
his
whiplash
.

With
that
possibility
in
mind
,
Arkansas'
Wilbur
Mills
deliberately
delayed
calling
a
meeting
of
the
Committee
on
Committees
,
and
coolheaded
Democrats
sought
to
bring
Rayburn
and
Smith
together
again
to
work
out
some
sort
of
face-saving
compromise
.

Battle
in
the
senate

Question
at
issue
:
How
big
a
vote
should
be
necessary
to
restrict
Senate
debate
--
and
thereby
cut
off
legislation-delaying
filibusters
?
?

Fair
Dealer
Humphrey
upped
the
ante
,
asked
cloture
power
for
a
mere
majority
of
Senators
.

Georgia's
Dick
Russell
objected
politely
,
and
the
battle
was
joined
.

In
1957
Nixon
delivered
a
significant
opinion
that
a
majority
of
Senators
had
the
power
to
adopt
new
rules
at
the
beginning
of
each
new
Congress
,
and
that
any
rules
laid
down
by
previous
Congresses
were
not
binding
.

This
is
the
first
time
in
100
years
that
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
announced
the
result
of
an
election
in
which
he
was
defeated
,
he
said
.

Just
when
you
think
you
have
it
licked
,
this
golf
course
can
get
up
and
bite
you
,
Player
had
said
one
afternoon
midway
through
the
tournament
.

He
bogeyed
the
10th
.

Now
all
he
had
to
do
was
finish
in
even
par
to
collect
the
trophy
and
the
biggest
single
paycheck
in
golf
.

Afterwards
,
Palmer
told
Charlie
Coe
,
his
last-round
partner
,
that
he
simply
played
the
hole
too
fast
.

Palmer's
281
for
the
four
rounds
at
Augusta
was
a
comfortable
four
strokes
ahead
of
the
next
closest
pro
,
but
it
was
barely
good
enough
for
a
second-place
tie
with
Coe
.

But
Palmer
knew
,
as
did
everybody
else
at
Augusta
,
that
his
streak
was
about
to
be
broken
.

Long
after
the
erratic
climate
and
the
washed-out
final
round
on
Sunday
have
become
meteorological
footnotes
,
the
1961
Masters
will
be
remembered
as
the
scene
of
the
mano
a
mano
between
Arnold
Palmer
and
Gary
Player
.

Unlike
most
such
sports
rivalries
,
it
appeared
to
have
developed
almost
spontaneously
,
although
this
was
not
exactly
the
case
.

As
if
to
confirm
his
stature
,
he
quickly
won
three
of
the
first
eight
tournaments
.

Player
immediately
proved
he
was
not
in
the
least
awed
by
the
dramatic
proximity
of
Palmer
.

He
outplayed
Palmer
all
around
the
course
and
finished
with
a
tremendous
65
to
Palmer's
71
.

Thereafter
,
until
the
Masters
,
Player
gradually
increased
his
lead
over
Palmer
in
winnings
and
added
one
more
tournament
victory
at
Miami
.

As
Player
began
his
second
round
in
a
twosome
with
amateur
Bill
Hyndman
,
his
share
of
the
gallery
was
not
conspicuously
large
for
a
contender
.

Player
began
with
a
birdie
on
the
first
hole
,
added
five
straight
pars
and
then
another
birdie
at
the
9th
.

At
one
point
late
in
the
day
,
when
Palmer
was
lining
up
a
25-foot
putt
on
the
16th
,
a
thunderous
cheer
from
the
direction
of
the
18th
green
unmistakably
announced
that
Player
had
birdied
the
final
hole
.

Without
so
much
as
a
grimace
or
a
gesture
to
show
that
he
had
noticed
(
although
he
later
admitted
that
he
had
)
Palmer
proceeded
to
sink
his
25-footer
,
and
his
gallery
sent
its
explosive
vocalization
rolling
back
along
the
intervening
fairways
in
reply
.

It
is
almost
axiomatic
that
golfers
who
dominate
the
game
of
golf
for
any
period
of
time
attack
their
shots
with
a
vehemence
bordering
on
violence
.

Byron
Nelson
did
,
Hogan
did
.

As
the
third
round
of
the
tournament
began
on
Saturday
and
the
duel
was
resumed
in
earnest
,
it
was
Player's
superior
aggressiveness
that
carried
him
into
the
lead
.

But
Player's
real
test
came
on
the
ninth
hole
,
a
downhill
dogleg
to
the
left
measuring
420
yards
.

He
hit
a
poor
tee
shot
,
pulling
it
off
into
the
pine
woods
separating
the
9th
and
first
fairways
.

Having
hit
one
of
the
trees
,
the
ball
came
to
rest
not
more
than
160
yards
out
.

Player
attacked
with
his
four-wood
and
hit
a
shot
that
few
who
saw
it
will
ever
forget
.

It
struck
the
9th
green
on
the
fly
and
stopped
just
off
the
edge
.

From
there
he
chipped
back
and
sank
his
putt
for
a
par
4
.

His
bogey
4
on
this
hole
and
subsequent
bogeys
at
5
and
7
along
with
a
birdie
at
8
brought
him
back
to
even
par
.

When
Roger
Eugene
Maris
,
Mantle's
muscular
teammate
,
powers
four
home
runs
in
a
double-header
,
his
performance
merits
awe
.

and
(
4
)
catcher
Johnny
Blanchard
of
the
New
York
Yankees
matched
a
record
with
home
runs
in
four
successive
times
at
bat
,
two
of
them
as
a
pinch-hitter
.

Experts
point
to
the
thinning
of
pitching
talent
in
the
American
League
caused
by
expansion
.

This
,
of
course
,
is
baseball's
most
remarkable
mark
:
The
60
home
runs
hit
in
1927
by
the
incorrigible
epicure
,
the
incredible
athlete
,
George
Herman
(
Babe
)
Ruth
of
the
Yankees
.

After
108
games
in
1927
,
Ruth
had
35
home
runs
.

Even
on
the
basis
of
154
games
,
this
is
the
ideal
situation
,
insists
Hank
Greenberg
,
now
vice-president
of
the
Chicago
White
Sox
.

Both
have
blue
eyes
and
short
blond
hair
.

With
their
huge
backs
and
overdeveloped
shoulders
,
both
must
have
their
clothes
made
to
order
.

What
do
you
and
Mickey
talk
about
at
home
?
?

What
is
surprising
and
pleasant
is
that
Mantle
and
Maris
,
under
constant
pressure
from
writers
and
photographers
,
are
trying
to
be
cooperative
.

I
tell
people
what
I
think
.

When
I
was
a
kid
,
Maris
told
a
sportswriter
last
week
,
I
used
to
follow
Williams
every
day
in
the
box
score
,
just
to
see
whether
he
got
a
hit
or
not
.

When
you
came
up
to
the
majors
,
did
you
seek
out
Williams
for
advice
?
?

He
told
me
he
vowed
right
then
that
if
he
ever
got
to
be
a
star
,
this
never
would
be
said
of
him
.

)
Hitting
,
Mantle
has
an
immediate
advantage
because
he
bats
both
left-handed
and
right-handed
,
Maris
only
left-handed
.

Mantle
is
considerably
better
hitting
for
average
(

,
fourth
in
the
league
,
to

Both
have
brilliant
speed
:
Mantle
was
timed
from
home
plate
(
batting
left-handed
)
to
first
base
in
3.1
seconds
,
faster
than
any
other
major
leaguer
;
;

Both
are
good
,
daring
fielders
:
Mantle
covers
more
ground
;
;

In
1920
,
as
the
startling
news
that
the
1919
White
Sox
had
conspired
to
lose
the
World
Series
leaked
out
,
fans
grew
disillusioned
and
disinterested
in
baseball
.

Also
included
in
the
entourage
:
a
dog
in
a
black
sweater
,
Frankie
and
Peter
had
an
urgent
mission
:
to
stage
a
mammoth
Inauguration
Eve
entertainment
gala
in
the
capital's
National
Guard
Armory
.

I
could
talk
to
you
for
three
hours
and
still
not
be
able
to
give
you
all
of
our
plans
!
!

As
the
plans
were
laid
,
some
several
thousand
fat
cats
were
to
be
ensconced
in
the
armory's
$100
seats
and
in
68
ringside
boxes
priced
at
$10,000
each
.

The
biggest
single
act
would
doubtless
be
staged
by
Frankie
himself
:
his
Inaugural
wardrobe
had
been
designed
by
Hollywood
Couturier
Don
Loper
,
who
regularly
makes
up
ladies'
ensembles
.

After
pushing
an
accumulation
of
vines
and
weeds
from
the
moldboard
,
I
lifted
the
lines
from
the
dust
and
found
hitched
to
that
plow
the
finest
team
I
ever
held
a
rein
on
.

But
Shoup
also
gave
the
Corps
a
tilling
in
spots
.

The
principal
of
the
school
announced
that
--
despite
the
help
of
private
tutors
in
Hollywood
and
Philadelphia
--
Fabian
is
a
10-o'clock
scholar
in
English
and
mathematics
.

I
am
useless
for
anything
but
racing
cars
.

Has
Moss
no
stirling
virtues
?
?

I
appreciate
beauty
.

Like
Philadelphia's
late
Dr.
Albert
C.
Barnes
who
kept
his
own
great
collection
closed
to
the
general
public
(
Time
,
Jan.
2
)
,
Thompson
,
at
61
,
is
something
of
a
legend
in
his
own
lifetime
.

He
was
able
to
smell
a
bargain
--
and
a
masterpiece
--
a
continent
away
,
and
the
Museum
of
Modern
Art's
Alfred
Barr
said
of
him
:
I
have
never
mentioned
a
new
artist
that
Thompson
didn't
know
about
.

He
gathered
one
of
the
biggest
collections
of
Paul
Klees
in
the
world
.

All
these
he
hung
in
his
burglarproof
home
called
Stone's
Throw
,
outside
Pittsburgh
,
and
only
people
he
liked
and
trusted
ever
got
to
see
them
.

At
the
opening
of
the
Dusseldorf
show
,
Thompson
himself
scarcely
glanced
at
the
treasures
that
he
was
seeing
together
for
the
last
time
.

The
university
rejected
them
on
a
variety
of
pretexts
,
but
was
careful
never
to
mention
the
color
of
their
skins
.

Holmes
was
asked
if
he
had
ever
visited
a
house
of
prostitution
,
or
a
beatnik
parlor
or
teahouse
.

Surprised
and
pleased
,
Students
Holmes
and
Hunter
may
enter
the
University
of
Georgia
this
week
.

When
the
University
of
Chicago's
Chancellor
Lawrence
A.
Kimpton
submitted
his
resignation
last
March
,
a
mighty
talent
hunt
gripped
the
Midway
.

Out
went
letters
to
60,000
old
grads
,
asking
for
suggestions
.

Last
week
Chicago
happily
found
its
top
scholar
in
Caltech's
acting
dean
of
the
faculty
:
dynamic
Geneticist
George
Wells
Beadle
,
57
,
who
shared
the
1958
Nobel
Prize
in
medicine
and
physiology
for
discovering
how
genes
affect
heredity
by
controlling
cell
chemistry
(
Time
,
Cover
,
July
14
,
1958
)
.

But
he
has
shown
a
sixth-sense
ability
to
spot
,
recruit
and
excite
able
researchers
,
and
has
developed
unexpected
talents
in
fund
raising
and
speech-making
.

Beadle
is
even
that
rare
scientist
who
takes
an
interest
in
money
matters
;
;

he
avidly
reads
the
Wall
Street
Journal
,
and
took
delight
in
driving
a
$250
model
A
Ford
for
22
years
,
then
selling
it
for
$300
.

A
philosopher
may
point
out
that
the
troubles
of
the
Congo
began
with
the
old
Adam
and
consequently
will
never
end
.

But
by
1908
its
record
of
brutality
had
touched
the
national
conscience
.

The
Belgian
government
itself
took
over
administration
,
commencing
a
program
of
paternalism
unmatched
in
the
history
of
colonialism
.

The
Belgians
were
interested
primarily
in
the
economic
development
of
the
Congo
,
which
is
rich
in
copper
,
tin
,
cobalt
,
manganese
,
zinc
,
and
uranium
,
and
cotton
and
palm
oil
.

they
put
much
effort
into
public
housing
.

During
the
1950s
there
were
as
many
as
25,000
schools
in
the
Congo
.

Indeed
,
the
Belgians
discouraged
higher
education
,
fearing
the
creation
of
a
native
intellectual
elite
which
might
cause
unrest
.

They
lacked
time
to
prepare
the
Congo
,
as
the
British
and
French
had
prepared
their
colonies
.

The
Congolese
were
clamoring
for
their
independence
,
even
though
most
were
unsure
what
it
meant
;
;

It
is
hard
to
blame
them
for
this
.

Yet
there
were
other
motivations
and
actions
which
the
Belgians
took
after
independence
for
which
history
may
not
find
them
guiltless
.

Third
,
there
were
those
(
notably
Patrice
Lumumba
)
who
favored
a
unified
Congo
with
a
very
strong
central
government
.

Well-wishers
around
the
world
hoped
that
the
Congo
would
quickly
assume
a
respectable
position
in
the
society
of
nations
.

If
internal
frictions
arose
,
they
could
be
handled
by
the
25,000-man
Congolese
army
,
the
Force
Publique
,
which
had
been
trained
and
was
still
officered
by
white
Belgians
.

Twenty-four
hours
after
independence
the
wild
tribesmen
commenced
fighting
each
other
.

each
succeeding
day
brought
new
acts
of
violence
.

On
July
14
the
Security
Council
--
with
France
and
Great
Britain
abstaining
--
voted
the
resolution
which
drew
the
U.N.
into
the
Congo
.

He
quickly
called
on
Ghana
,
Tunisia
,
Morocco
,
Guinea
and
Mali
,
which
dispatched
troops
within
hours
.

(
However
,
there
is
little
evidence
that
the
late
Lumumba
was
a
Communist
.

Control
of
the
government
--
such
control
as
there
was
and
such
government
as
there
was
--
passed
into
the
hands
of
Joseph
Mobutu
,
chief
of
staff
of
the
Congolese
army
.

On
Feb.
21
the
council
passed
another
resolution
urging
the
taking
of
all
appropriate
measures
to
prevent
the
occurrence
of
civil
war
in
the
Congo
,
including
the
use
of
force
,
if
necessary
,
in
the
last
resort
.

The
presidency
:
talking
and
listening

High
up
on
the
President's
priority
list
was
the
thorny
question
of
Bizerte
.

Ideally
,
the
President
would
like
the
French
to
agree
on
a
status
quo
ante
on
Bizerte
,
and
accept
a
new
timetable
for
withdrawing
their
forces
from
the
Mediterranean
base
.

To
continue
their
important
conversations
about
the
Tunisian
issue
and
the
whole
range
of
other
problems
,
Mr.
Kennedy
invited
Stevenson
to
Cape
Cod
for
the
weekend
.

The
President
also
discussed
the
Bizerte
deadlock
with
the
No.
2
man
in
the
Tunisian
Government
,
Defense
Minister
Bahi
Ladgham
,
who
flew
to
Washington
last
week
to
seek
U.S.
support
.

and
one
U.S.
official
said
:
The
key
question
now
is
which
side
picks
up
the
phone
first
.

Main
purpose
of
the
meeting
:
To
discuss
President
Kennedy's
Alliance
for
Progress
.

At
3:57
a.m.
,
with
the
plane
about
twenty
minutes
out
of
El
Paso
,
passenger
Robert
Berry
,
a
San
Antonio
advertising
man
,
glanced
up
and
saw
the
man
and
boy
,
accompanied
by
a
stewardess
,
walking
up
the
aisle
toward
the
cockpit
.

I
figured
he
was
sick
.

the
man
put
his
at
the
head
of
Capt.
Byron
D.
Rickards
.

The
ground
crew
,
which
ordinarily
fuels
a
707
in
twenty
minutes
,
took
fully
three
hours
.

The
elder
Bearden
had
one
pistol
in
his
hand
,
the
other
in
a
hip
pocket
.

He
caught
officer
Simmons'
eye
,
nodded
toward
young
Bearden
,
and
--
I
swung
my
right
as
hard
as
I
could
.

(
Bearden
reportedly
hoped
to
peddle
the
plane
to
Castro
,
and
live
high
in
Cuba
.

)
The
House
,
which
had
passed
its
smaller
appropriation
before
the
President's
urgent
call
for
more
,
was
expected
to
go
along
with
the
increased
defense
budget
in
short
order
.

The
Senate
(
by
voice
vote
)
and
the
House
(
by
224-170
)
passed
and
sent
to
the
White
House
the
compromise
farm
bill
which
the
President
is
expected
to
sign
,
not
too
unhappily
.

Debate
on
the
all-important
foreign-aid
bill
,
with
its
controversial
long-range
proposals
,
had
just
begun
on
the
Senate
floor
at
the
weekend
.

But
,
because
they
are
politicians
,
they
like
to
talk
as
poor-mouth
as
the
lowliest
voter
.

As
a
result
,
ever
since
1851
when
the
Senate
restaurant
opened
in
the
new
wing
of
the
Capitol
Building
,
the
senators
have
never
ceased
to
grumble
about
the
food
--
even
while
they
opposed
every
move
that
might
improve
it
.

In
a
daring
stroke
,
the
Senate
ventured
forth
last
week
into
the
world
of
haute
cuisine
and
hired
a
$10,000-per-year
French-born
maitre
d'hotel
.

Another
result
is
that
buyers
are
tending
to
bid
up
the
prices
of
these
tax-exempt
bonds
.

Other
tax-exempt
bonds
of
State
and
local
governments
hit
a
price
peak
on
February
21
,
according
to
Standard
&
Poor's
average
.

However
,
in
the
same
three-month
period
,
toll-road
bonds
,
as
a
group
,
have
bucked
this
trend
.

Nearly
all
the
turnpikes
show
gains
in
net
revenues
during
the
period
.

Then
March
brought
an
18
per
cent
rise
in
net
revenues
--
after
operating
costs
.

That
same
pattern
of
earnings
shows
up
on
the
Massachusetts
Turnpike
.

Costs
were
held
down
,
despite
a
bitter
winter
.

In
the
12
months
ended
in
February
,
1961
,
this
highway
earned
93
per
cent
of
its
interest
.

That
improvement
is
continuing
.

Higher
tolls
are
planned
for
July
1
,
1961
,
on
the
Richmond-Petersburg
,
Va.
,
Turnpike
,
and
proposals
for
increased
tolls
on
the
Texas
Turnpike
are
under
study
.

Net
earnings
of
that
road
rose
from
62
per
cent
of
interest
requirements
in
calendar
1957
to
86
per
cent
in
the
12
months
ended
Feb.
28
,
1961
.

Traffic
and
revenues
on
the
Chicago
Skyway
have
been
a
great
disappointment
to
planners
and
investors
alike
.

If
nothing
is
done
,
the
prospect
is
that
that
road
will
be
in
default
of
interest
in
1962
.

These
,
however
,
are
exceptions
.

Already
,
however
,
several
of
the
turnpikes
are
earning
enough
to
cover
interest
requirements
by
comfortable
margins
.

A
top
American
official
,
after
a
look
at
Europe's
factories
,
thinks
the
U.S.
is
in
a
very
serious
situation
competitively
.

Fiat
officials
say
they
have
had
no
strikes
for
more
than
six
years
.

There
are
many
places
where
we
can
use
their
vigor
and
new
ideas
'
.

The
recently
unveiled
Kennedy
moves
to
control
the
international
textile
market
can
be
significant
for
American
businessmen
in
many
lines
.

An
international
conference
of
the
big
textile-importing
and
textile-exporting
countries
will
be
called
shortly
by
President
Kennedy
.

Japan
,
since
1957
,
has
been
voluntarily
curbing
exports
of
textiles
to
the
U.S.
.

The
Government
will
help
in
transferring
companies
and
workers
into
new
lines
,
where
modernization
doesn't
seem
feasible
.

Government
research
will
look
into
new
products
and
methods
.

Among
the
highest-paid
workers
in
the
world
are
U.S.
coal
miners
.

Many
of
the
coal
seams
in
the
nationalized
British
mines
are
twisting
,
narrow
and
very
deep
.

They
threaten
to
strike
.

Every
library
borrower
,
or
at
least
those
whose
taste
goes
beyond
the
five-cent
fiction
rentals
,
knows
what
it
is
to
hear
the
librarian
say
apologetically
,
I
am
sorry
,
but
we
don't
have
that
book
.

There
wouldn't
be
much
demand
for
it
,
I
am
afraid
.

Most
library
budgets
are
hopelessly
inadequate
.

Both
these
types
,
and
those
in
between
,
are
in
existence
by
reason
of
a
legislative
interest
in
libraries
that
began
at
Albany
as
early
as
1950
,
with
the
creation
by
the
legislature
of
county
library
systems
financed
by
county
governments
with
matching
funds
from
the
state
.

It
was
a
step
in
the
right
direction
,
but
it
took
an
additional
act
passed
in
1958
to
establish
fully
the
thriving
systems
of
today
.

Under
this
law
annual
grants
are
given
to
systems
in
substantial
amounts
.

Some
library
boards
are
wary
of
the
plan
.

The
basic
state
grant
is
thirty
cents
for
each
person
served
,
and
there
is
a
further
book
incentive
grant
that
provides
an
extra
twenty
cents
up
to
fifty
cents
per
capita
,
if
a
library
spends
a
certain
number
of
dollars
.

In
Nassau
County
,
for
example
,
the
heavily
settled
Long
Island
suburb
of
New
York
City
,
the
system
is
credited
by
the
state
with
serving
one
million
persons
,
a
figure
that
has
doubled
since
1950
.

Nassau
is
currently
building
a
central
collection
of
reference
materials
in
its
Hempstead
headquarters
,
which
will
reach
its
goal
of
100,000
volumes
by
1965
.

Headquarters
gets
about
100
requests
every
day
.

The
books
are
carried
around
by
truck
in
canvas
bags
from
headquarters
to
the
other
libraries
.

Further
money
is
saved
through
economy
in
bookkeeping
and
clerical
detail
as
the
result
of
central
billing
.

it
prepares
cooperative
displays
(
posters
,
booklists
,
brochures
,
and
other
promotional
material
)
for
use
in
member
libraries
;
;

it
maintains
a
central
exhibit
collection
to
share
displays
already
created
and
used
;
;

Today
,
more
than
ever
before
,
the
survival
of
our
free
society
depends
upon
the
citizen
who
is
both
informed
and
concerned
.

Although
progress
has
been
made
in
America's
system
of
libraries
it
still
falls
short
of
what
is
required
if
we
are
to
maintain
the
standards
that
are
needed
for
an
informed
America
.

The
problem
grows
in
intensity
each
year
as
man's
knowledge
,
and
his
capacity
to
translate
such
knowledge
to
the
written
word
,
continue
to
expand
.

In
college
libraries
,
57
per
cent
of
the
total
number
of
books
are
owned
by
124
of
1,509
institutions
surveyed
last
year
by
the
U.S.
Office
of
Education
.

In
every
aspect
of
service
--
to
the
public
,
to
children
in
schools
,
to
colleges
and
universities
--
the
library
of
today
is
failing
to
render
vitally
needed
services
.

Only
public
understanding
and
support
can
provide
that
service
.

It
was
faced
immediately
with
a
showdown
on
the
schools
,
an
issue
which
was
met
squarely
in
conjunction
with
the
governor
with
a
decision
not
to
risk
abandoning
public
education
.

This
session
,
for
instance
,
may
have
insured
a
financial
crisis
two
years
from
now
.

Certainly
all
can
applaud
passage
of
an
auto
title
law
,
the
school
bills
,
the
increase
in
teacher
pensions
,
the
ban
on
drag
racing
,
acceptance
by
the
state
of
responsibility
for
maintenance
of
state
roads
in
municipalities
at
the
same
rate
as
outside
city
limits
,
repeal
of
the
college
age
limit
law
and
the
road
maintenance
bond
issue
.

Only
a
token
start
was
made
in
attacking
the
tax
reappraisal
question
and
its
companion
issue
of
attracting
industry
to
the
state
.

We
congratulate
the
entire
membership
on
its
record
of
good
legislation
.

If
once
they
become
inattentive
to
the
public
affairs
,
Jefferson
said
,
you
and
I
,
and
Congress
and
assemblies
,
judges
and
governors
,
shall
all
become
wolves
.

The
league
workers
search
out
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
most
complex
issues
and
make
them
available
to
the
public

Coupling
its
own
budget
of
$83,750
with
a
$30,000
state
grant
authorized
by
Gov.
Vandiver
,
the
group
expects
to
sign
a
contract
in
March
with
Georgia
Tech.
.

The
undertaking
has
abundant
promise
.

Rusk
idea
strengthens
United
States
defense

The
danger
lay
in
the
American
delusion
that
nuclear
deterrence
was
enough
.

Chin
up
,
Soapy
.

It
is
good
to
know
that
Georgia
will
continue
to
have
sufficient
electrical
power
not
only
to
meet
the
demands
of
normal
growth
but
to
encourage
a
more
rapid
rate
of
industrialization
.

Actually
it
amounts
to
$1,250,000
above
what
the
institution
already
is
receiving
,
considering
the
additional
half-million
dollars
Gov.
Vandiver
allocated
last
year
from
the
state
surplus
.

More
attendants
,
nurses
and
doctors
should
be
hired
.

Considering
what
is
being
done
compared
to
what
needs
to
be
done
,
it
behooves
the
hospital
management
to
do
some
mighty
careful
planning
toward
making
the
best
possible
use
of
the
increase
granted
.

Rafael
Trujillo
,
the
often
blood-thirsty
dictator
of
the
Dominican
Republic
for
31
years
,
perhaps
deserved
his
fate
in
an
even-handed
appraisal
of
history
.

The
jails
were
filled
to
overflowing
with
political
prisoners
who
had
incurred
his
displeasure
.

What
comes
after
Trujillo
is
now
the
puzzle
.

The
Dominican
people
have
known
no
democratic
institutions
and
precious
little
freedom
for
a
generation
,
and
all
alternative
leadership
has
been
suppressed
.

Perhaps
the
army
will
be
able
to
maintain
stability
,
but
the
vacuum
of
free
institutions
creates
a
great
danger
.

Such
a
twist
would
be
a
tragedy
for
the
Dominican
people
,
who
deserve
to
breathe
without
fear
.

High-speed
buses
on
the
George
Washington
Memorial
Parkway
,
operating
between
downtown
Washington
and
Cabin
John
,
Glen
Echo
and
Brookmont
,
would
constitute
an
alluring
sample
of
what
the
new
National
Capital
Transportation
Agency
can
do
for
this
city
.

Though
Walter
Ulbricht
,
by
grace
of
Soviet
tanks
,
may
be
head
man
in
East
Germany
,
that
does
not
give
him
any
right
to
usurp
the
government
of
East
Berlin
or
to
absorb
that
semi-city
into
the
Soviet
zone
.

It
was
not
a
part
of
any
one
of
the
three
(
later
four
)
zones
for
occupation
by
Soviet
,
American
,
British
,
and
French
troops
respectively
.

For
some
time
the
Communists
honored
the
distinction
between
the
Soviet
zone
of
Germany
and
the
Soviet
sector
of
Berlin
by
promulgating
separately
the
laws
for
the
two
areas
.

The
Chancellor
had
as
much
business
there
as
Ulbricht
had
in
East
Berlin
--
and
was
certainly
less
provocative
than
the
juvenile
sound-truck
taunts
of
Gerhard
Eisler
.

One
ground
of
action
certainly
exists
when
fusillades
of
stray
shots
go
over
into
West
Berlin
as
Communist
vopos
try
to
gun
down
fleeing
unarmed
residents
.

A
Philadelphia
distiller
is
currently
breaching
the
customary
prohibition
against
hard-liquor
advertising

and

Past
polls
of
public
opinion
show
popular
favor
for
this
policy
.

Soon
some
members
of
the
two
industry
groups
doubtless
will
want
to
amend
their
codes
on
grounds
that
otherwise
they
will
suffer
unfairly
from
the
efforts
of
non-code
competitors
.

In
the
central
contest
,
that
for
Mayor
,
they
may
have
found
some
pertinent
points
in
what
each
faction
has
said
about
the
other
.

The
Mayor
is
finding
it
awkward
to
campaign
against
his
own
record
.

But
his
reelection
would
strengthen
the
liberal
Democrats
and
the
labor
unions
who
back
him
.

If
this
choice
is
less
exciting
than
New
York
Democrats
may
wish
,
it
nevertheless
must
be
made
.

Both
Mr.
K's
have
so
far
continued
to
speak
softly
and
carry
big
sticks
over
Laos
.

At
the
scene
he
has
just
as
clearly
shown
his
military
strength
in
unprovocative
but
ready
position
.

As
wars
go
,
Laos
is
an
extremely
little
one
.

Actually
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
the
leader
of
the
alliance
now
has
swung
fully
behind
the
British
policy
of
seeking
to
achieve
a
neutral
Laos
via
the
international
bargaining
table
.

The
State
Department
tacitly
rejected
the
neutral
Laos
idea
after
the
Geneva
conference
of
1954
,
and
last
year
Washington
backed
the
rightist
coup
that
ousted
neutral
Premier
Souvanna
Phouma
.

But
since
last
fall
the
United
States
has
been
moving
toward
a
pro-neutralist
position
and
now
is
ready
to
back
the
British
plan
for
a
cease-fire
patrolled
by
outside
observers
and
followed
by
a
conference
of
interested
powers
.

The
world
awaits
Mr.
Khrushchev's
choice
of
alternatives
.

A
vote
for
educational
TV

Mr.
Rayburn
was
not
an
easy
man
to
classify
or
to
label
.

He
was
no
flaming
liberal
,
yet
the
New
Deal
,
the
Fair
Deal
and
the
New
Frontier
needed
him
.

He
was
not
a
rear-looking
conservative
,
yet
partisans
of
that
persuasion
will
miss
him
as
much
as
any
.

It
might
be
added
that
as
he
kept
his
word
so
he
expected
that
others
keep
theirs
.

He
made
good
,
plain
American
common
sense
and
the
House
usually
recognized
it
and
acted
upon
it
.

He
expected
Democrats
to
do
their
duty
when
it
had
been
patiently
pointed
out
to
them
.

And
it
was
the
House
he
loved
.

He
served
with
him
.

Woodrow
Wilson
,
with
whom
he
began
his
years
in
Washington
,
Warren
G.
Harding
,
Calvin
Coolidge
,
FDR
,
with
whom
he
managed
a
social
revolution
.

And
those
still
with
us
,
Herbert
C.
Hoover
,
Harry
S.
Truman
,
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
and
John
F.
Kennedy
.

Mr.
Truman
has
only
to
recall
the
hopeless
campaign
of
1948
to
remember
what
a
loyal
partisan
he
was
and
the
first
experience
of
Mr.
Kennedy
with
Congress
would
have
been
sadder
than
it
was
had
not
Mr.
Sam
been
there
.

As
it
was
,
his
absence
because
of
his
final
illness
was
a
blow
to
the
administration
.

He
was
his
own
man
,
not
an
automatic
obstructionist
.

A
recent
editorial
discussing
a
labor-management
agreement
reached
between
the
Southern
Pacific
Co.
and
the
Order
of
Railroad
Telegraphers
has
been
criticized
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
based
on
complete
information
.

The
editorial
was
based
on
a
news
association
dispatch
which
said
that
the
telegraphers
had
secured
an
agreement
whereby
they
were
guaranteed
40
hours'
pay
per
week
whether
they
worked
or
not
and
that
a
reduction
in
their
number
was
limited
to
2
per
cent
per
year
.

The
statement
was
also
made
that
undoubtedly
the
railroad
had
received
some
compensating
benefit
from
the
telegraphers
,
but
that
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
what
could
balance
a
job
for
life
.

The
situation
with
regard
to
the
Southern
Pacific
was
therefore
a
special
one
and
not
necessarily
applicable
to
other
situations
in
other
industries
.

It
was
,
the
brief
writers
decided
,
man's
best
hope
for
a
peaceful
and
law
abiding
world
.

A
nuclear
pacifier
of
these
dimensions
--
roughly
some
six
and
a
half
times
bigger
than
anything
the
United
States
has
triggered
experimentally
--
would
certainly
produce
a
bigger
bang
,
and
,
just
for
kicks
,
Khrushchev
might
use
it
to
propel
the
seminar
of
the
house
of
delegates
from
St.
Louis
to
the
moon
,
where
there
wouldn't
even
be
any
beer
to
drink
.

While
he
was
at
it
,
the
philosopher
of
the
Kremlin
contributed
an
additional
assist
to
the
rule
of
reason
by
bellowing
at
those
in
the
west
who
can't
appreciate
coexistence
thru
suicide
.

The
board's
action
shows
what
free
enterprise
is
up
against
in
our
complex
maze
of
regulatory
laws
.

Word
of
Dag
Hammarskjold's
death
in
an
African
plane
crash
has
sent
a
shockwave
around
the
globe
.

The
U.N.-chartered
plane
which
was
flying
from
the
conference
city
of
Ndola
in
Northern
Rhodesia
had
been
riddled
with
machinegun
bullets
last
weekend
and
was
newly
repaired
.

His
policies
had
resolved
the
conflicts
that
threatened
to
ignite
the
cold
war
and
workable
solutions
were
beginning
to
take
shape
.

The
U.N.
session
scheduled
for
today
will
meet
under
the
cloud
of
his
passing
.

reaching
agreement
on
projects
of
value
to
the
whole
community
has
long
been
one
of
Greater
Miami's
hardest
tasks
.

So
we
note
approvingly
a
fresh
sample
of
unanimity
.

The
next
step
awaits
approval
today
by
the
Metro
commissioners
as
the
members
of
the
Dade
County
Port
Authority
.

Unanimity
on
Interama
is
not
surprising
.

Interama
,
as
it
rises
,
will
be
a
living
monument
to
Greater
Miami's
ability
to
get
together
on
worthwhile
enterprises
.

Much
happened
in
this
field
during
the
past
12
months
.

Problems
have
arisen
in
this
sensitive
field
but
have
been
handled
in
most
cases
with
understanding
and
restraint
.

The
aging
chancellor
in
all
likelihood
will
be
retired
.

He
is
dedicated
to
building
the
nation's
strength
and
,
as
are
all
West
Germans
,
to
a
free
Berlin
and
to
reunion
with
captive
East
Germany
.

The
question
left
by
the
election
is
whether
West
Germany
veers
slightly
toward
more
firmness
or
more
flexibility
.

It
could
go
either
way
,
since
the
gains
for
both
points
of
view
were
about
the
same
.

And
the
career
of
Konrad
Adenauer
,
who
upheld
Germany's
tradition
of
rock-like
leaders
which
Bismarck
began
,
draws
near
the
end
.

Does
it
assail
schools
and
churches
with
blanket
accusations
?
?

Does
it
attack
other
traditional
American
institutions
with
unsupportable
and
wild
charges
?
?

Does
it
attempt
to
rewrite
modern
history
by
blaming
American
statesmen
for
wars
,
Communism
,
depression
,
and
other
troubles
of
the
world
?
?

Does
it
employ
crude
pressure
tactics
with
such
means
as
anonymous
telephone
calls
and
letter
writing
campaigns
?
?

If
the
would-be
joiner
asks
these
questions
he
is
not
likely
to
be
duped
by
extremists
who
are
seeking
to
capitalize
on
the
confusions
and
the
patriotic
apprehensions
of
Americans
in
a
troubled
time
.

And
until
this
protection
is
at
least
as
concrete
as
,
say
,
the
row
of
hotels
that
bars
us
from
our
own
sands
at
Miami
Beach
,
those
who
represent
us
all
should
agree
to
nothing
.

But
the
citizens
would
,
of
course
,
never
be
sure
that
the
decisions
that
resulted
were
as
correct
as
they
were
expeditious
.

None
of
the
Trujillo
family
remains
.

Had
U.S.
warships
not
appeared
off
the
Dominican
coast
,
there
is
every
possibility
that
the
country
would
now
be
wracked
by
civil
war
.

Walter
Reuther
,
leader
of
the
industrial
union
faction
of
the
AFL-CIO
,
says
another
two
years
of
this
squabbling
will
be
disastrous
for
all
American
labor
.

the
Army
,
Navy
and
Air
Force
,
among
others
,
may
question
Secretary
Freeman's
claim
that
the
high
estate
of
United
States
agriculture
is
the
strongest
deterrent
to
the
spread
of
communism
.

Mr.
Freeman
said
that
in
many
of
the
countries
he
visited
on
a
recent
world
trade
trip
people
were
more
awed
by
America's
capacity
to
produce
food
surpluses
than
by
our
industrial
production
--
or
even
by
the
Soviet's
successes
in
space
.

In
exchange
for
higher
price
supports
,
growers
pledged
reduction
in
planted
acreage
.

But
now
apparently
the
job
of
Secretary
of
Labor
requires
that
he
be
willing
to
risk
his
reputation
as
a
prognosticator
of
unemployment
trends
.

He
is
basing
his
guess
on
new
government
statistics
that
show
business
has
broadened
its
stride
--
a
new
record
high
in
personal
income
,
an
increase
in
housing
starts
,
a
spurt
in
retail
sales
and
a
gain
in
orders
for
durable
goods
.

Mr.
Mitchell
had
an
excuse
for
losing
--
the
steel
strike
lasted
much
longer
than
he
anticipated
.

The
odds
thus
appear
favorable
that
the
secretary's
neck
may
be
spared
.

Prince
Sihanouk's
powers
of
prognostication
some
day
may
be
confirmed
but
history
is
not
likely
to
praise
the
courage
of
his
convictions
.

And
now
Mr.
Hodges
has
pioneered
further
into
the
economic
unknown
with
the
announcement
that
he
thinks
business
has
stopped
sliding
and
that
it
should
start
going
upward
from
this
point
.

Of
course
,
some
of
the
credit
for
the
sale
boost
must
be
given
to
improvement
in
the
weather
and
to
the
fact
that
Easter
comes
more
than
two
weeks
earlier
than
in
1960
.

Another
optimistic
sign
,
this
one
from
the
Labor
Department
,
was
the
report
that
the
long
rise
in
unemployment
compensation
payments
was
interrupted
for
the
first
time
in
the
week
ending
Feb.
25
.

Well
,
we
can't
have
everything
.

The
move
for
establishment
of
a
national
seashore
park
on
30,000
acres
of
Cape
Cod
,
from
Provincetown
to
Chatham
,
is
strengthened
by
President
Kennedy's
interest
in
that
area
.

But
that
heritage
is
shrinking
even
faster
.

It
will
be
a
16-hour
training
day
.

Then
off
to
a
remote
place
in
an
underdeveloped
country
where
the
diet
,
culture
,
language
and
living
conditions
will
be
different
.

Not
all
St.
Louis
industries
,
of
course
,
have
a
market
area
confined
to
the
immediate
neighborhood
.

That
is
one
approach
.

In
Southern
Illinois
,
the
new
federal
program
of
help
to
economically
depressed
areas
ought
to
provide
some
stimulus
to
growth
.

The
Carbondale
Industrial
Development
Corp.
has
obtained
a
$500,000
loan
to
help
defray
the
cost
of
remodeling
a
city-owned
factory
to
accommodate
production
that
will
provide
500
new
jobs
.

Politics-ridden
St.
Clair
county
in
Illinois
presents
another
piece
of
the
problem
of
metropolitan
development
.

More
industrial
acreage
lies
vacant
in
St.
Clair
county
than
in
any
other
jurisdiction
in
the
St.
Louis
area
.

Some
plant-location
specialists
take
these
signs
to
mean
St.
Louis
county
doesn't
want
industry
,
and
so
they
avoid
the
area
,
and
more
jobs
are
lost
.

An
excess
of
zeal

Many
of
our
very
best
friends
are
reformers
.

The
White
House
itself
has
taken
steps
to
remove
a
former
Batista
official
,
Col.
Mariano
Faget
,
from
his
preposterous
position
as
interrogator
of
Cuban
refugees
for
the
Immigration
Service
.

The
Kennedy
Administration
had
assured
anti-Castro
Cubans
that
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
associates
of
Dictator
Batista
.

Moreover
,
Col.
Faget's
information
on
Cuba
was
too
outdated
to
be
useful
in
screening
Castro
agents
;
;

At
that
point
the
Administration
will
have
little
reason
to
hang
onto
Gen.
Swing
.

Some
of
former
President
Truman's
off-the-cuff
discourses
have
been
in
that
vein
.

This
would
be
cheaper
to
operate
and
could
be
used
for
cruises
during
the
lean
winter
months
.

The
decline
of
the
Cunard
line
from
its
position
of
dominance
in
Atlantic
travel
is
a
significant
development
in
the
history
of
transportation
.

There
was
good
reason
for
Gen.
Taylor
to
make
an
inspection
trip
at
this
time
.

Communist
guerrillas
recently
have
been
reported
increasing
their
activities
and
the
great
flood
of
the
Mekong
River
has
interposed
a
new
crisis
.

Gov.
John
M.
Dalton
,
himself
a
lawyer
and
a
man
of
long
service
in
government
,
spoke
with
rich
background
and
experience
when
he
said
in
an
address
here
that
lawyers
ought
to
quit
sitting
in
the
Missouri
General
Assembly
,
or
quit
accepting
fees
from
individuals
and
corporations
who
have
controversies
with
or
axes
to
grind
with
the
government
and
who
are
retained
,
not
because
of
their
legal
talents
,
but
because
of
their
government
influence
.

Ambassador
Stevenson
yesterday
described
the
U.N.'s
problem
of
electing
a
temporary
successor
to
the
late
Dag
Hammarskjold
as
the
gravest
crisis
the
institution
has
faced
.

The
Charter
does
stipulate
that
due
regard
shall
be
paid
to
the
importance
of
recruiting
the
staff
on
as
wide
a
geographical
basis
as
possible
.

If
any
one
of
them
has
any
power
to
veto
the
Secretary
General's
decisions
the
nature
of
the
organization
will
have
changed
.

We
should
not
become
confused
or
let
our
public
become
confused
over
irrelevant
questions
of
number
or
even
of
geography
.

What
we
must
have
,
if
the
United
Nations
is
to
survive
,
is
as
nonpolitical
,
nonpartisan
an
organization
at
the
top
as
human
beings
can
make
it
,
subject
to
no
single
nation's
direction
and
subservient
to
no
single
nation's
ambition
.

What
the
new
charter
does

There
is
no
such
magic
in
man-made
laws
.

but
,
as
a
second-look
safeguard
,
each
new
project
must
undergo
a
Board
of
Estimate
public
hearing
before
construction
proceeds
.

This
will
have
a
beneficial
effect
by
expediting
public
business
;
;

Freedom
of
the
press
was
lost
in
Cuba
because
of
decades
of
corruption
and
social
imbalances
.

This
,
in
more
diplomatic
language
,
is
what
Adlai
Stevenson
told
the
newspaper
men
of
Latin
America
yesterday
on
behalf
of
the
United
States
Government
.

No
group
can
contribute
more
to
the
success
of
the
program
than
the
editors
and
publishers
of
the
Inter-American
Press
Association
.

Dr.
Conant's
call
to
action

Dr.
James
B.
Conant
has
earned
a
nationwide
reputation
as
a
moderate
and
unemotional
school
reformer
.

His
earlier
reports
considered
the
American
public
schools
basically
sound
and
not
in
need
of
drastic
change
.

Dr.
Conant
may
underestimate
the
psychological
importance
of
even
token
equality
.

Dr.
Conant's
conscientious
,
selfless
efforts
deserve
the
nation's
gratitude
.

And
now
--
more
junk
mail

Occasional
letters
are
sent
by
individuals
to
one
another
and
many
are
written
by
companies
to
one
another
,
but
these
are
mostly
typewritten
.

She
had
,
she
said
,
heard
that
the
plant
was
closing
.

She
had
,
with
her
own
work-weary
hands
,
put
seeds
in
the
ground
,
watched
them
sprout
,
bud
,
blossom
,
and
get
ready
to
bear
.

Is
it
so
the
cannery
is
going
to
close
?
?

He
did
say
she
could
get
her
beef
and
vegetables
in
cans
this
summer
.

the
old
woman
with
the
stew
.

One
night
,
at
the
close
of
the
evening
service
,
he
came
forward
,
left
his
resentment
at
the
altar
and
gave
his
heart
to
God
.

I
settled
it
tonight
,
he
continued
.

It
will
do
no
good
to
seek
God's
forgiveness
until
we
have
forgiven
those
who
have
done
us
wrong
.

We
want
the
past
forgiven
,
but
at
the
same
time
we
must
be
willing
for
God
to
direct
the
future
.

Till
seven
times
?
?

I
wanted
to
grab
her
by
the
arm
and
beg
her
to
wait
,
to
consider
,
to
know
for
certain
because
life
is
so
long
and
marriage
is
so
important
.

Besides
,
in
all
honesty
,
I
don't
know
how
you
can
be
sure
.

Oh
,
no-o
!
!

I
mean
,
I
went
on
ruthlessly
,
when
he's
not
talking
about
you
or
himself
or
the
wonders
of
love
,
is
he
interesting
?
?

Can
you
visualize
being
stranded
with
him
on
a
desert
island
for
years
and
years
and
still
find
him
fascinating
?
?

She
asked
if
I
had
other
advice
and
,
heady
with
success
,
I
rushed
it
in
,
I
hope
not
too
late
.

Be
friends
with
your
mother-in-law
.

But
I
was
deeply
moved
by
his
letter
of
resignation
as
rector
of
St.
Luke's
Church
in
Atlanta
.

Who
stops
to
think
of
that
?
?

Such
a
church
needs
vigor
and
vitality
in
its
rector
and
one
man
has
only
so
much
of
these
endowments
,
he
told
his
members
.

Yet
we
who
lean
upon
such
a
man
and
draw
strength
from
him
and
expect
interpretation
of
the
infinite
through
him
--
we
who
readily
accept
his
sacrifice
as
our
due
,
we
of
the
congregations
are
the
first
to
tell
him
what
is
in
our
minds
instead
of
listening
to
what
is
in
his
soul
.

But
how
little
love
we
give
him
.

The
church
truly
is
not
a
rest
home
for
saints
,
but
a
hospital
for
sinners
.

The
evening
was
not
always
spent
in
the
same
way
.

Mrs.
Podger
had
obligingly
pushed
things
around
on
the
porch
to
make
room
for
it
,
and
there
it
was
,
slung
in
a
vine-shaded
corner
,
the
night
breeze
rippling
its
fringe
with
a
slow
,
caressing
movement
.

Mr.
Podger
sat
down
in
it
,
pushed
himself
back
and
forth
in
one
or
two
slow
,
rhythmic
motions
,
and
then
swung
his
feet
up
into
it
.

But
,
it
said
,
do
you
always
know
when
you
are
happy
?
?

All
day
long
Mr.
Podger
,
who
was
a
straw-hat
man
in
the
summer
,
had
worn
the
feather
in
the
band
of
his
broad-brimmed
sunshield
.

Would
a
blue
feather
in
a
man's
hat
make
him
happy
all
day
?
?

Then
,
since
the
auction
was
being
held
nearby
,
he
had
walked
to
it
.

Taking
off
his
hat
and
signaling
the
driver
with
it
,
Mr.
Podger
stepped
into
the
road
,
lifted
the
surprised
turtle
and
consummated
its
road-crossing
with
what
must
have
been
a
breath-taking
suddenness
.

I
like
them
things
,
too
,
he
had
said
.

If
you
are
lyin'
out
in
the
hammock
at
night
,
and
it
gets
kinda
cool
--
you
know
--
you
just
take
these
sides
with
the
fringe
on
--
see
--
and
wrap
'em
right
over
you
.

Mr.
Podger
had
thanked
him
gravely
,
and
now
he
made
use
of
the
advice
.

Soon
her
purring
rivaled
the
chirping
of
the
tree
crickets
,
rivaled
the
hum
of
voices
from
inside
the
Pod
.

We
need
you
to
start
it
.

Mr.
Podger
opened
his
cocoon
and
emerged
,
tucking
Alacrity
under
his
arm
to
bring
her
in
by
the
fire
.

The
two
cities
have
the
examples
of
Little
Rock
and
New
Orleans
to
hold
up
as
warnings
against
resorting
to
violence
to
try
to
stop
the
processes
of
desegregation
.

In
Nashville
,
a
school
was
dynamited
.

In
Houston
,
there
were
a
few
incidents
of
friction
between
whites
and
Negroes
,
none
of
which
were
serious
.

The
Nashville
plan
,
incidentally
,
has
become
recognized
as
perhaps
the
most
acceptable
and
thus
the
most
practical
to
put
into
effect
in
the
troubled
South
.

It
is
a
stair-step
plan
,
in
which
desegregation
begins
in
the
first
grade
.

Each
year
another
grade
is
added
to
the
process
,
until
finally
all
12
grades
are
integrated
.

Another
attempt
will
be
made
this
year
in
New
Orleans
to
resume
the
program
.

During
the
summer
,
Negroes
began
quietly
patronizing
previously
segregated
restaurants
and
lunch
counters
in
downtown
retail
establishments
.

Since
moving
from
a
Chicago
suburb
to
Southern
California
a
few
months
ago
,
I've
been
introduced
to
a
new
game
called
Lanesmanship
.

The
adjacent
driver
in
Lane
B
has
three
choices
open
to
him
.

He
can
(
1
)
point
his
car
resolutely
at
the
invading
fender
and
force
the
other
driver
back
into
Lane
A
;
;

Failing
this
,
he
would
pull
alongside
at
the
first
opportunity
and
shake
his
fist
threateningly
.

After
three
months
of
research
,
I
can
state
unequivocally
that
Los
Angeles
drivers
are
considerably
more
courteous
and
competent
than
any
other
drivers
I've
ever
encountered
.

Miami

An
out-of-town
writer
came
up
to
Paul
Richards
today
and
asked
the
Oriole
manager
if
he
thought
his
ball
club
would
be
improved
this
year
.

Now
Richards
,
of
course
,
is
known
as
a
deep
thinker
as
baseball
managers
go
.

It's
a
whole
lot
easier
,
he
said
,
to
increase
the
population
of
Nevada
,
than
it
is
to
increase
the
population
of
New
York
city
.

This
was
just
Richard's
way
of
saying
that
last
year
the
Birds
opened
spring
training
with
a
lot
of
jobs
wide
open
.

It
should
be
easier
to
plug
two
spots
than
it
was
to
fill
the
wholesale
lots
that
were
open
last
year
,
but
so
far
it
hasn't
worked
that
way
.

Obviously
,
if
this
club
is
going
to
move
from
second
to
first
in
the
American
League
,
it
will
have
to
show
improvement
someplace
.

Brooks
Robinson
is
great
,
and
it
is
conceivable
that
he'll
do
even
better
in
1961
than
he
did
in
1960
.

It's
the
same
with
Ron
Hansen
and
Jim
Gentile
.

He
got
off
to
an
exceptional
start
last
season
,
and
under
the
circumstances
probably
won't
duplicate
it
.

Gentile
can
hardly
do
better
than
drive
in
98
runs
.

But
even
so
,
he
had
a
good
year
in
1960
and
won't
do
too
much
better
.

So
,
all
in
all
,
the
infield
can't
be
expected
to
supply
the
added
improvement
to
propel
the
Birds
from
second
to
first
.

From
Triandos
,
Brandt
and
Walker
,
answers
Richards
.

They
are
the
ones
we
can
expect
to
do
better
.

The
man
is
right
,
and
at
this
time
,
indications
are
that
these
three
are
ready
for
better
seasons
.

If
he
can
bounce
back
with
one
of
those
25
home
runs
years
,
the
club
will
have
to
be
better
off
offensively
.

To
me
,
Brandt
looks
as
though
he
could
be
in
for
a
fine
year
.

He's
been
entirely
different
all
spring
.

Let
him
bounce
back
,
and
he
could
really
set
up
the
staff
.

So
,
if
the
Orioles
are
to
improve
,
Brandt
,
Triandos
and
Walker
will
have
to
do
it
.

Is
the
mother
of
an
autistic
child
at
fault
?
?

The
mother
of
a
difficult
child
can
do
a
great
deal
to
help
her
own
child
and
often
,
by
sharing
her
experiences
,
she
can
help
other
mothers
with
the
same
problem
.

He
wants
me
to
do
everything
for
him
.

As
he
grows
older
it
may
be
a
matter
of
providing
some
accustomed
object
(
his
magic
thing
)
.

Or
certain
words
or
rituals
that
child
and
adult
go
through
may
do
the
trick
.

We
did
not
accept
the
diagnosis
at
once
,
but
gradually
we
are
coming
to
.

What
I
do
is
to
try
to
bring
him
into
contact
with
reality
as
much
as
possible
.

Seen
in
decorating
circles
of
late
is
a
renewed
interest
in
an
old
art
:
embroidery
.

Possibly
responsible
for
this
is
the
incoming
trend
toward
multicolor
schemes
in
rooms
,
which
seems
slated
to
replace
the
one-color
look
to
which
we
have
been
accustomed
.

One
such
,
in
fact
,
is
a
rug
.

Though
not
actually
crewel
embroidery
,
it
has
that
look
with
its
over-stitched
raised
pattern
in
blue
,
pink
,
bronze
and
gold
and
a
sauterne
background
.

Among
some
recent
imports
were
seat
covers
for
one
series
of
dining
room
chairs
on
which
were
depicted
salad
plates
overflowing
with
tomatoes
and
greens
and
another
set
on
which
a
pineapple
was
worked
in
naturalistic
color
.

California

they
have
been
quietly
assembling
in
a
thousand
district
headquarters
,
party
clubrooms
and
workers'
backyards
.

And
they
are
confident
that
the
GOP
,
currently
assailed
by
dissensions
within
the
ranks
,
will
be
impressed
by
the
purring
power
beneath
the
hood
of
this
grassroots-fueled
machine

President
Kennedy's
latest
warning
to
the
Communist
world
that
the
United
States
will
build
up
its
military
strength
to
meet
any
challenge
in
Berlin
or
elsewhere
was
,
somewhat
surprisingly
,
reported
in
full
text
or
fairly
accurate
excerpts
behind
the
Iron
Curtain
.

President
Kennedy
once
again
interpreted
the
Soviet
proposals
,
to
sign
a
peace
treaty
with
Germany
as
a
threat
,
as
part
of
the
world
menace
allegedly
looming
over
the
countries
of
capitalism
.

The
West
Berlin
crisis
is
being
played
up
artificially
because
it
is
needed
by
the
United
States
to
justify
its
arms
drive
.

A
better
position
for
negotiations
is
the
real
point
of
this
speech
.

Kennedy
knows
the
West
will
not
wage
war
for
West
Berlin
,
neither
conventional
nor
nuclear
,
and
negotiations
will
come
as
certainly
as
the
peace
treaty
.

during

The
350th
anniversary
of
the
King
James
Bible
is
being
celebrated
simultaneously
with
the
publishing
today
of
the
New
Testament
,
the
first
part
of
the
New
English
Bible
,
undertaken
as
a
new
translation
of
the
Scriptures
into
contemporary
English
.

However
,
Biblical
scholars
frequently
attested
to
its
numerous
inaccuracies
,
as
old
manuscripts
were
uncovered
and
scholarship
advanced
.

Undertaken
by
32
American
scholars
,
under
the
chairmanship
of
Rev.
Dr.
Luther
A.
Weigle
,
former
dean
of
Yale
University
Divinity
School
,
their
studies
resulted
in
the
publishing
of
the
Revised
Standard
Version
,
1946-52
.

For
example
,
in
the
third
chapter
of
Matthew
,
verses
13-16
,
describing
the
baptism
of
Jesus
,
the
1611
version
reads
:

But
John
forbad
him
,
saying
,
I
have
need
to
be
baptized
of
thee
,
and
comest
thou
to
me
?
?

John
tried
to
dissuade
him
.

'
I
need
rather
to
be
baptized
by
you
.

Jesus
replied
,
'
let
it
be
so
for
the
present
;
;

Some
of
the
poetic
cadence
of
the
older
version
certainly
is
lost
in
the
newer
one
,
but
almost
anyone
,
with
a
fair
knowledge
of
the
English
language
,
can
understand
the
meaning
,
without
the
necessity
of
interpretation
by
a
Biblical
scholar
.

Originally
recorded
by
hand
,
these
words
have
been
copied
and
recopied
,
translated
and
retranslated
through
the
ages
.

With
contemporary
English
changing
with
the
rapidity
that
marks
this
jet
age
,
some
of
the
words
and
phrases
of
the
new
version
may
themselves
soon
become
archaic
.

and
suffers
losses
could
at
the
time
hardly
face
his
wife
who
was
wondering
how
her
husband
could
be
so
dumb
.

It
motivates
his
behavior
.

He
wants
Mommy
to
think
him
a
good
boy
.

He
doesn't
want
her
to
look
frowningly
at
him
,
or
speak
to
him
angrily
.

She
can
remove
all
knick-knacks
within
reach
.

Toys
he
has
can
be
made
to
act
as
substitutes
for
family
temptations
such
as
refrigerator
and
gas
stove
.

Remove
the
child
from
the
scene
of
his
misbehavior
.

It
is
true
,
of
course
,
the
uncertainties
of
life
being
what
they
are
,
that
as
now
and
then
the
Christian
killed
the
lion
,
homecoming
days
have
been
ruined
by
a
visiting
team
.

More
often
than
not
,
as
the
Old
Grad
wanders
along
the
old
paths
,
his
memory
of
happy
days
when
he
strolled
one
of
the
paths
with
a
coed
beside
him
becomes
an
ache
and
a
pain
.

He
feels
,
suddenly
,
the
weight
of
the
fat
that
is
on
him
.

By
then
one
begins
to
notice
the
middle-age
spread
;
;

the
gray
hairs
,
the
eyeglasses
,
bodies
that
are
too
thin
or
too
heavy
;
;

A
team
feels
something
.

the
smell
and
feel
of
hot
,
wet
woolen
sleeves
across
his
face
.

And
so
,
he
squirms
with
each
play
,
remembering
his
youth
.

Of
40
cities
with
populations
of
300,000
and
more
,
Mr.
Kennedy
carried
26
and
Mr.
Nixon
14
.

These
are
New
York
,
Pennsylvania
,
Michigan
,
Maryland
,
Missouri
,
New
Jersey
,
Illinois
and
Minnesota
.

A
GOP
task
force
'
committee
will
seek
to
find
out
how
its
party
may
win
support
from
the
ethnic
and
minority
groups
in
cities
.

These
gentlemen
already
have
done
the
party
harm
by
their
seeming
reluctance
to
vote
aid
for
the
depressed
areas
and
by
their
criticism
of
Mr.
Kennedy
for
talking
about
a
recession
and
unemployment
.

This
error
was
compounded
by
declaring
the
recession
to
be
a
statistical
one
,
and
not
a
reality
.

After
the
Griffin-Byrd
political
troup
has
completed
the
circuit
in
November
in
the
name
of
a
Pre-Legislative
Forum
,
this
is
going
to
be
the
most
politically
oriented
Legislature
in
history
.

Every
legislator
from
Brasstown
Bald
to
Folkston
is
going
to
have
his
every
vote
subjected
to
the
closest
scrutiny
as
a
test
of
his
political
allegiances
,
not
his
convictions
.

The
situation
already
was
bad
because
the
Legislature
moved
the
governor's
race
forward
a
few
months
,
causing
the
campaigning
to
get
started
earlier
than
usual
.

They
are
just
asking
too
much
,
he
said
.

If
either
one
ever
started
making
promises
,
there
is
no
telling
where
the
promises
would
end
.

Former
British
Prime
Minister
Attlee
says
Eisenhower
was
not
a
great
soldier
.

Slogan
of
the
John
Birch
Society
:
Paddle
your
own
canoe
.

The
guy
who
makes
the
motor
boats
may
be
a
Communist
.

This
would
seem
to
indicate
that
we
are
trying
neither
to
halt
an
influx
of
migrants
nor
are
we
setting
up
such
standards
for
development
that
only
the
well-to-do
could
afford
to
buy
land
and
build
in
the
new
sites
.

The
wisdom
of
granting
such
tax
exemptions
is
another
matter
,
but
this
particular
instance
is
,
in
my
opinion
,
completely
satisfactory
.

In
order
to
attract
additional
industry
that
is
compatible
with
this
community
it
is
all
the
more
important
to
present
to
the
industrial
prospect
an
orderly
balance
in
the
tax
structure
.

As
this
tax
base
grows
so
then
can
your
medium
and
low
density
residential
areas
grow
.

We
in
East
Greenwich
have
the
example
of
two
neighboring
communities
,
one
currently
utilizing
double
sessions
in
their
schools
,
and
the
other
facing
this
prospect
next
year
.

If
they
are
to
be
commended
for
foresight
in
their
planning
,
what
then
is
the
judgment
of
a
town
council
that
compounds
this
problem
during
the
planning
stage
?
?

For
example
:
1
.

The
East
Greenwich
Free
Library
receives
financial
support
from
the
town
of
East
Greenwich
and
the
City
of
Warwick
to
supplement
its
endowment
.

The
education
program
for
retarded
children
conducted
by
the
East
Greenwich
school
system
has
pupils
from
at
least
one
neighboring
community
.

I
believe
it
is
an
area
in
which
professional
planners
have
failed
to
set
adequate
guide
posts
;
;

Rev.
DeWitt
Clemens
,
pastor
of
the
Mathewson
Street
Methodist
Church
;
;

and
to
Mrs.
Rozella
Switzer
,
regional
director
of
The
National
Conference
of
Christians
and
Jews
,
who
asked
them
to
serve
as
a
committee
for
the
fund
.

I
do
not
think
that
America
is
like
Russia
,
not
in
the
least
!
!

The
arguments
advanced
by
those
individuals
and
groups
who
oppose
the
system
in
force
and
who
would
drastically
curtail
or
do
away
entirely
with
hospital
care
for
the
non-service-connected
case
,
seem
to
be
coldly
impractical
and
out-of-step
with
the
wishes
of
the
general
public
.

So
he
keeps
the
veteran
in
until
he
can
observe
the
effects
of
treatment
or
surgery
.

The
responsibility
is
still
going
to
be
there
whether
they
pay
for
a
VA
hospital
or
the
tax
dollar
is
spent
for
the
state
hospital
.

An
adequate
system
of
VA
hospitals
is
better
equipped
to
care
for
the
veterans
than
any
50
state
hospitals
.

Nevertheless
,
we
wonder
at
the
stand
of
the
A.M.A.
on
the
health
problem
confronting
the
aged
.

They
opposed
the
Forand
bill
,
which
would
have
placed
the
major
burden
of
financial
support
upon
the
individual
himself
through
compulsory
payroll
deduction
;
;

yet
they
supported
the
Eisenhower
administration
which
will
cost
a
small
state
like
ours
approximately
five
million
dollars
(
matched
incidentally
by
a
federal
grant
)
to
initiate
.

During
his
aggressive
campaign
to
win
his
present
position
,
Mr.
Kennedy
was
vitriolic
about
this
country's
prestige
abroad
.

What
does
he
think
a
remark
like
this
lousy
one
does
to
our
prestige
and
morale
?
?

Let
us
prepare
for
peace
,
instead
of
for
a
war
which
would
mean
the
end
of
civilization
.

In
order
to
attract
new
industries
,
15
states
or
more
are
issuing
tax
free
bonds
to
build
government
owned
plants
which
are
leased

enterprise

Workers
of
the
party

to
the
editor
:

Sir
--
When
the
colonies
decided
upon
freedom
from
England
,
we
insisted
,
through
the
Declaration
of
Independence
,
that
the
nations
of
the
world
recognize
us
as
a
separate
political
entity
.

The
people
of
Katanga
had
fought
for
,
and
obtained
,
their
freedom
from
the
Communist
yoke
of
Antoine
Gizenga
,
and
his
cohorts
.

This
is
taxation
without
representation
.

Sir
--
Your
editorial
,
Housing
Speedup
,
is
certainly
not
the
answer
to
our
slum
problems
.

The
very
rules
and
regulations
in
every
city
are
the
primary
case
of
slum
conditions
.

to
the
editor
:

Sir
--
I
hasten
to
join
in
praise
of
the
men
in
the
toll
booths
on
the
Garden
State
Parkway
.

Recently
I
traveled
the
parkway
from
East
Orange
to
Cape
May
and
I
found
the
most
courteous
group
of
men
you
will
find
anywhere
.

One
even
gave
my
little
dog
a
biscuit
.

The
viewers
of
the
Deep
Peep
Show
at
15th
and
M
Streets
NW
have
an
added
attraction
--
the
view
of
a
fossilized
cypress
swamp
.

The
fossilized
remains
of
many
of
these
trees
are
found
embedded
in
the
clay
.

In
the
clay
are
entombed
millions
of
pollen
grains
and
spores
which
came
from
plants
growing
in
the
region
at
the
time
.

These
microfossils
indicate
the
swamp
was
formed
during
the
Lower
Cretaceous
period
when
dinosaurs
were
at
their
heyday
and
when
the
first
flowering
plants
were
just
appearing
.

While
I
respect
his
sincere
concern
for
peace
,
he
made
four
points
that
I
would
like
to
question
.

Are
we
not
late
,
especially
those
of
us
who
call
ourselves
Friends
,
in
doing
enough
about
this
lack
of
understanding
?
?

Would
the
man
with
an
empty
life
boat
row
away
from
a
shipwreck
because
his
boat
could
not
pick
up
everyone
?
?

If
the
world
comes
to
this
,
wouldn't
it
be
the
very
time
when
courage
and
American
know-how
would
be
needed
to
help
survivors
rebuild
?
?

I
grant
that
the
dog
may
not
be
really
protective
,
based
on
his
training
,
but
if
you
were
roaming
the
streets
looking
for
a
purse
to
snatch
or
a
young
lady
to
molest
,
how
quick
would
you
be
to
attack
a
person
strolling
with
a
dog
?
?

I
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
landlords
and
Commissioners
get
together
and
consider
liberalizing
the
practice
of
prohibiting
dogs
in
apartments
.

Dissenting
views
of
senators

Two
strong
dissents
from
the
majority
report
of
the
Joint
Economic
Committee
(
May
2
)
by
Senators
Proxmire
and
Butler
allege
that
the
New
Deal
fiscal
policy
of
the
Thirties
did
not
work
.

Soviet
Russia
has
been
invaded
twice
by
German
troops
in
a
generation
.

Berlin
is
merely
being
used
by
Moscow
as
a
stalking
horse
.

If
the
German
people
favor
such
a
settlement
we
should
not
oppose
Germany
following
the
example
of
Austria
.

Why
not
make
a
beginning
with
a
united
and
disarmed
Germany
whose
neutrality
and
immunity
from
nuclear
bombing
would
be
guaranteed
by
the
Big
Four
powers
and
the
United
States
?
?

A
united
Germany
,
freed
of
militarism
,
might
be
the
first
step
toward
disarmament
and
peace
in
a
terrorized
and
tortured
world
.

to
the
editor
of
the
New
York
Times
:

Section
2
:
:

A
Member
of
the
United
Nations
which
is
in
arrears
in
the
payment
of
its
financial
contributions
to
the
Organization
shall
have
no
vote
in
the
General
Assembly
if
the
amount
of
its
arrears
equals
or
exceeds
the
amount
of
the
contributions
due
from
it
for
the
preceding
two
full
years
.

Our
destiny
in
these
perilous
times
should
be
to
lead
strongly
in
the
pursuit
of
peace
,
with
justice
,
under
law
.

Recently
I
visited
the
very
remarkable
Pilgrim
School
for
retarded
children
.

There
is
no
charge
and
no
state
aid
.

Enough
trading
stamps
were
collected
to
buy
a
12-passenger
station
wagon
.

After
all
,
they
are
paid
by
the
public
,
they
should
be
examples
.

to
the
editor
:

At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
Women's
Association
of
the
Trumbull
Ave.
United
Presbyterian
Church
,
considerable
use
was
made
of
material
from
The
Detroit
News
on
the
King
James
version
of
the
New
Testament
versus
the
New
English
Bible
.

We
feel
that
The
Detroit
News
is
to
be
complimented
upon
arranging
for
articles
on
these
subjects
and
we
hope
that
it
will
continue
to
provide
material
along
wholesome
lines
.

How
old
do
you
have
to
be
to
remember
when
Americans
,
especially
children
,
were
encouraged
to
be
polite
?
?

From
necessity
,
they
are
also
inspired
by
the
hard-sell
attitude
of
the
sponsor
,
so
,
finally
,
it
is
the
sponsor
who
must
take
the
responsibility
for
the
good
or
bad
taste
of
his
advertising
.

I
commend
Senator
Hart
for
his
brave
fight
to
establish
a
national
park
in
the
dunes
area
.

The
trucks
today
help
pay
for
this
highway
.

They
try
to
keep
within
the
speed
limits
.

Everyone
should
take
time
to
read
Martin
Luther's
Hymn
A
Mighty
Fortress
Is
Our
God
.

Having
led
the
world
in
this
mad
race
I
pray
that
we
may
have
the
wisdom
and
courage
to
lead
it
out
of
the
race
.

To
the
editor
of
the
Inquirer
:

Just
to
remind
the
Communists
that
the
bombs
dropped
on
Japan
were
to
end
a
war
not
start
one
.

The
war
could
have
continued
many
years
with
many
thousands
killed
on
both
sides
.

Had
it
been
bestowed
while
the
Secretary
General
of
the
United
Nations
was
living
,
unquestionably
he
would
have
been
greatly
encouraged
in
pursuing
a
difficult
and
,
in
many
ways
,
thankless
task
.

At
Khrushchev's
door
,
therefore
,
can
be
placed
the
primary
blame
but
also
at
fault
are
those
who
permitted
themselves
to
be
intimidated
.

It
is
well
for
us
to
remember
that
a
wreath
on
a
coffin
never
can
atone
for
flowers
withheld
while
they
still
can
be
enjoyed
.

Just
a
brief
note
of
appreciation
to
Vice
President
Johnson
and
Pakistani
camel
driver
Bashir
Ahmad
for
providing
a
first-class
example
of
people
to
people
good
will
.

to
the
editor
of
the
Inquirer
:

Each
one
of
these
is
,
by
its
nature
,
a
focal
point
or
a
point
of
natural
congestion
.

Widen
the
East
River
Drive
at
least
one
lane
.

So
widen
it
as
to
minimize
the
present
curves
and
eliminate
drainage
problems
.

Shadow
over
Washington
Square

Washington
Square
seems
not
part
of
a
free
land
.

but
it
can't
remind
one
of
the
freedom
that
Washington
and
the
Continental
soldiers
fought
for
.

The
Feeding
of
Birds
is
Prohibited
in
This
square
.

They
are
the
most
beautiful
part
of
that
little
piece
of
nature
.

The
trees
are
their
homes
;
;

The
whole
official
City
apparently
has
an
intense
hatred
toward
birds
.

The
City
Government
is
not
united
in
an
all-out
,
to-the-death
drive
to
stamp
out
gangs
,
delinquents
,
thugs
,
murderers
,
rapists
,
subversives
.

Let
every
policeman
and
park
guard
keep
his
eye
on
John
and
Jane
Doe
,
lest
one
piece
of
bread
be
placed
undetected
and
one
bird
survive
.

Of
course
,
in
this
small
way
of
forcing
the
people
to
watch
as
tiny
and
innocent
and
dependent
creatures
die
because
we
are
afraid
to
feed
them
and
afraid
to
protest
and
say
,
How
come
?
?

We
will
know
,
and
He
will
know
,
to
whom
it
is
rendered
,
what
the
birds
would
ask
:

not
push-ups
but
stand-ups

Unfortunately
,
those
who
would
remedy
our
softness
seek
to
do
so
with
calisthenics
.

These
arrangements
would
have
been
impossible
if
the
business
community
was
truly
interested
in
the
welfare
of
its
employes
.

A
sweetheart
arrangement
can
come
about
as
often
by
employers
doing
the
corrupting
as
by
unscrupulous
labor
leaders
demanding
tribute
.

Anyone
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
McClellan
hearings
must
at
once
realize
that
the
sweetheart
arrangements
augmented
employer
profits
far
more
than
they
augmented
the
earnings
of
the
corruptible
labor
leaders
.

Further
,
it
should
be
recalled
that
some
very
definite
steps
were
taken
by
Congress
to
combat
corruption
in
the
labor
movement
by
its
passage
of
the
Landrum-Griffin
Act
.

They
predicted
escalation
,
and
escalation
is
what
we
are
getting
.

Only
a
discontinuity
can
end
it
,
Professor
Morrison
writes
.

they
will
be
faithful
unto
death
.

Not
terror
,
but
anger
and
resentment
have
been
the
general
reaction
outside
the
Soviet
sphere
.

The
flood
is
not
as
great
--
only
700
a
week
according
to
one
apparently
conservative
account
--
but
it
is
symptomatic
.

The
official
statistics
show
that
60
per
cent
are
employed
workers
or
independent
professional
people
.

And
in
England
,
after
the
Restoration
,
the
body
of
Cromwell
was
disinterred
and
hanged
at
Tyburn
.

Nikita
Khrushchev
,
however
,
has
created
yet
another
problem
for
himself
.

There
is
Karl
Marx
,
of
course
,
buried
in
London
.

Besides
,
he
can
hardly
avoid
musing
on
the
instability
of
death
which
,
what
with
exhumations
and
rehabilitations
,
seems
to
match
that
of
life
.

U
Thant
of
course
,
will
hold
office
until
the
spring
of
1963
,
when
Mr.
Hammarskjold's
term
would
have
come
to
an
end
.

they
are
also
trained
with
carbines
,
automatic
weapons
,
pistols
,
rifles
and
other
such
ladies'
accessories
.

The
doctrine
has
never
worked
;
;

it
is
not
working
now
.

it
cannot
bring
them
into
actual
play
.

As
the
civic
temper
rises
,
the
more
naive
citizens
begin
to
play
soldier
--
but
the
guns
are
real
.

All
false
gods
resemble
Moloch
,
at
least
in
the
early
phases
of
their
careers
,
so
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
any
form
of
idol-worship
to
become
widespread
without
the
accompaniment
of
human
sacrifice
.

a
quota
of
25,000
a
year
would
be
more
than
sufficient
.

Here
,
then
,
is
what
Swift
would
have
called
a
modest
proposal
by
way
of
a
beginning
.

To
avoid
suspicion
of
bigotry
,
let
the
hand
of
vengeance
be
stayed
until
the
meat-wagon
has
picked
up
the
twenty-five
thousandth
corpse
;
;

The
scene
,
of
course
,
should
be
nine
miles
northwest
of
Centralia
,
Illinois
,
the
geographical
center
of
population
according
to
the
census
.

If
we
make
it
established
custom
that
whenever
butchery
on
the
highways
grows
excessive
,
say
beyond
25,000
per
annum
,
then
somebody
is
going
to
hang
,
it
follows
that
the
more
eminent
the
victim
,
the
more
impressive
the
lesson
.

so
,
all
things
considered
,
the
highway
commissioners
would
seem
to
be
elected
.

As
it
descends
,
the
concentration
of
radioactivity
builds
up
in
the
human
body
;
;

So
,
while
we
properly
inveigh
against
the
new
poisoning
,
history
is
not
likely
to
justify
the
pose
of
righteousness
which
some
in
the
West
were
so
quick
to
assume
when
Mr.
Khrushchev
made
his
cynical
and
irresponsible
threat
.

Shock
,
dismay
and
foreboding
for
future
generations
were
legitimate
reactions
;
;

On
the
one
hand
,
the
Public
Health
Service
declared
as
recently
as
October
26
that
present
radiation
levels
resulting
from
the
Soviet
shots
do
not
warrant
undue
public
concern
or
any
action
to
limit
the
intake
of
radioactive
substances
by
individuals
or
large
population
groups
anywhere
in
the
Aj
.

Then
,
to
conclude
on
an
indeterminate
note
:
Nevertheless
,
if
fallout
increased
substantially
,
or
remained
high
for
a
long
time
,
it
would
become
far
more
important
as
a
potential
health
hazard
in
this
country
and
throughout
the
world
.

Dr.
Linus
Pauling
,
a
Nobel
Prize
winner
in
chemistry
,
has
been
less
ambiguous
,
whether
you
choose
to
agree
with
him
or
not
.

Long-lived
carbon-14
from
the
fusion
process
would
cause
four
million
embryonic
,
neonatal
or
childhood
deaths
and
stillbirths
over
the
next
20
generations
,
and
between
200,000
and
one
million
human
beings
now
living
would
have
their
lives
cut
short
by
radiation-produced
diseases
such
as
leukemia
.

After
a
nuclear
blast
,
one
bureaucrat
suggested
in
those
halcyon
days
,
about
all
you
had
to
do
was
haul
out
the
broom
and
sweep
off
your
sidewalks
and
roof
.

As
of
October
25
,
the
AEC
had
reported
24
shots
in
the
new
Soviet
series
,
12
of
them
in
a
megaton
range
,
including
a
super
bomb
with
a
yield
of
30
to
50
megatons
(
the
equivalent
of
30
million
to
50
million
tons
of
TNT
)
;
;

The
second
great
dilemma
has
been
the
morality
of
nuclear
testing
,
a
dilemma
which
has
suddenly
become
acute
because
of
the
present
series
of
Soviet
tests
.

When
this
second
dilemma
first
became
obvious
--
during
the
mid
to
late
'50's
--
the
United
States
appeared
to
have
three
choices
.

With
the
resumption
of
Soviet
testing
and
their
intransigence
at
the
Geneva
talks
,
however
,
the
hope
that
this
third
choice
would
prove
viable
has
been
shaken
.

Once
again
,
the
United
States
must
choose
.

Its
primary
advantage
is
that
it
is
a
moral
choice
;
;

one
which
,
should
it
fail
,
will
not
have
contaminated
the
conscience
.

Leaving
aside
the
choice
of
unilateral
cessation
of
tests
as
neither
sane
nor
clearly
moral
,
the
question
must
arise
as
to
why
resumption
of
atmospheric
tests
on
our
part
would
not
be
a
good
choice
.

For
that
is
the
one
an
increasingly
large
number
of
prominent
Americans
are
now
proposing
.

Unless
the
Administration
and
the
Defense
Department
have
been
deceiving
us
,
the
facts
do
not
support
the
assertion
that
we
are
compelled
to
resume
atmospheric
testing
.

Too
often
in
the
past
Russian
tactics
have
been
used
to
justify
like
tactics
on
our
part
.

Equally
significant
,
Pope
John
has
said
that
Catholics
themselves
bear
some
responsibility
for
Christian
disunity
.

The
designation
of
five
Catholic
theologians
to
attend
the
World
Council
of
Churches
assembly
in
New
Delhi
as
official
observers
reverses
the
Church's
earlier
stand
.

Nor
can
one
forget
Pope
John's
unprecedented
meeting
with
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.

Noting
all
the
difficulties
that
stand
in
the
way
of
reunion
,
he
has
said
that
they
ought
not
to
discourage
anyone
.

the
administration's
official
budget
review
,
which
estimates
a
6.9
billion
dollar
deficit
for
the
current
fiscal
year
,
isn't
making
anyone
happy
.

In
the
first
place
,
a
large
part
of
the
discrepancy
between
President
Eisenhower's
estimate
of
a
1.5
billion
dollar
surplus
for
the
same
period
and
the
new
estimate
of
an
almost
seven
billion
dollar
deficit
is
the
result
of
the
outgoing
President's
farewell
gift
of
a
political
booby-trap
to
his
successor
.

The
Eisenhower
budget
was
simultaneously
inadequate
in
its
provisions
and
yet
extravagant
in
its
projections
of
revenue
to
be
received
.

Four
billion
dollars
of
the
spending
increase
is
for
defense
,
an
expenditure
necessitated
by
the
penny-wise
policies
of
the
Eisenhhower
Administration
,
quite
apart
from
the
recent
crises
in
Berlin
and
elsewhere
.

The
farm
program
will
cost
an
additional
1.5
billion
,
because
of
unusual
weather
factors
,
the
Food
for
Peace
program
and
other
new
measures
.

introduction
of
the
dialogue
principle
proved
strikingly
effective
at
the
thirty-fourth
annual
meeting
of
the
Catholic
Association
for
International
Peace
in
Washington
the
last
weekend
in
October
.

In
the
earlier
sessions
there
was
plentiful
discussion
on
the
natural
law
,
which
Dr.
William
V.
O'Brien
of
Georgetown
University
,
advanced
as
the
basis
for
widely
acceptable
ethical
judgments
on
foreign
policy
.

That
Aristotelean-Thomistic
principle
experienced
a
thorough
going-over
from
a
number
of
the
participants
,
but
in
the
end
the
concept
came
to
reassert
itself
.

A
Lebanese
Moslem
told
about
its
existence
and
application
in
the
Islamic
tradition
as
the
divine
law
,
while
a
C.A.I.P.
member
who
has
been
working
in
close
association
with
delegates
of
the
new
U.N.
nations
told
of
its
widespread
recognition
on
the
African
continent
.

the
pervasive
influence
of
ideology
on
our
political
judgments
needs
to
be
recognized
and
taken
into
due
account
;
;

I
was
searching
for
an
accent
of
self-delusion
or
,
even
,
of
hypocrisy
.

He
smiled
also
at
a
British
bloke
seated
next
to
me
,
who
asked
the
most
asinine
questions
.

Relative
military
manpower
?
?

But
the
army
which
Mao
continues
to
feed
well
,
where
are
its
sympathies
?
?

Every
soldier
in
the
army
has
,
somewhere
,
relatives
who
are
close
to
starvation
.

Their
privations
are
almost
beyond
endurance
.

Leninism-Marxism
,
as
understood
by
Exegete
Mao
.

The
first
was
the
commune
program
,
which
will
ensure
agricultural
poverty
for
years
.

For
it
is
the
family
that
,
in
China
,
has
always
provided
social
security
for
the
indigent
,
the
sick
,
the
down-and-out
members
of
the
clan
.

These
continuing
pressures
,
social
,
economic
and
military
,
are
doing
much
to
keep
China
in
a
heightening
state
of
tension
.

On
these
they
feel
they
can
rely
.

Secondly
,
they
depend
on
America's
moral
cooperation
when
the
crucial
moment
arrives
.

I
remarked
jocularly
to
the
President
that
the
future
of
China
would
be
far
more
certain
if
he
would
invite
a
planeload
of
selected
American
Liberals
to
Quemoy
on
an
odd
day
.

But
our
outlook
has
been
,
and
continues
to
be
,
defensive
.

A
great
deal
depends
on
the
crystallization
of
Mr.
Kennedy's
views
on
the
world
struggle
.

A
truth-revealing
crisis
erupted
in
Katanga
for
a
couple
of
days
this
month
,
to
be
quickly
smothered
by
the
high
pressure
verbal
fog
that
is
kept
on
tap
for
such
emergencies
.

Of
course
the
fighting
was
officially
under
the
auspices
of
the
United
Nations
.

There
is
even
some
question
whether
the
U.S.
can
any
longer
defend
itself
against
an
initiative
by
the
Left
.

We
can
force
Britain
and
France
out
of
the
Suez
,
but
we
cannot
so
much
as
try
to
force
the
Russian
tanks
back
from
Budapest
.

As
our
planes
land
the
war
materiel
that
kills
pro-Western
Katangans
,
we
stand
supinely
bleating
while
Nehru's
troops
smash
into
a
five-hundred-year-old
district
of
our
NATO
ally
,
Portugal
.

It
is
the
consequence
of
the
system
of
ideas
that
constitutes
the
frame
of
our
international
--
and
in
some
degree
our
domestic
--
policy
.

Our
chief
aim
becomes
that
of
finding
favor
in
neutralist
eyes
.

But

of
the
boldest
and
most
original
pictures
of
his
time
,
and
even
after
nearly
half
a
century
,
the
tense
,
tormented
world
he
put
on
canvas
has
lost
none
of
its
fascination
.

When

The
most
surprising
thing
about
the
Twenty-second
Congress
of
the
Soviet
Communist
Party
is
that
it
is
surprising
--
perhaps
quite
as
much
,
in
its
own
way
,
as
the
Twentieth
Congress
of
1956
,
which
ended
with
that
famous
secret
report
on
Stalin
.

As
we
know
,
the
Soviet
peasant
today
still
very
largely
thrives
on
being
able
to
sell
the
produce
grown
on
his
private
plot
;
;

It
contained
,
for
example
,
a
number
of
curious
admissions
about
the
peasants
,
who
enjoy
no
sickness
benefits
,
no
old-age
pensions
,
no
paid
holidays
;
;

in
fact
,
with
having
been
against
all
the
more
popular
features
of
the
Khrushchev
welfare
state
.

The
trouble
with
all
these
doctrinal
quarrels
is
that
we
hear
only
one
side
of
the
story
:
what
,
in
the
secret
councils
of
the
Kremlin
,
Molotov
had
really
proposed
,
we
just
don't
know
,
and
he
has
had
no
chance
to
reply
.

The
effect
of
Chou
En-lai's
clash
with
Khrushchev
,
together
with
the
everlasting
attacks
on
Molotov
&
Co.
,
has
shifted
the
whole
attention
of
the
world
,
including
that
of
the
Soviet
people
,
from
the
epoch-making
twenty-year
program
to
the
present
Soviet-Chinese
conflict
.

The
big
question
is
whether
,
in
the
name
of
a
restored
Chinese-Soviet
solidarity
,
the
Chinese
will
choose
to
persuade
the
Albanians
to
present
their
humble
apologies
to
Khrushchev
--
or
get
rid
of
Enver
Hoxa
.

But
Albania
is
merely
a
symptom
of
a
real
malaise
between
China
and
Russia
.

Khrushchev
,
for
all
his
bombastic
prophecies
about
the
inevitable
decay
of
capitalism
,
is
genuinely
favorable
to
peaceful
coexistence
and
would
like
,
above
all
,
the
Berlin
and
German
problems
to
be
settled
peacefully
;
;

But
it
seems
that
pressures
against
him
are
coming
from
somewhere
--
in
the
first
place
from
China
,
but
perhaps
also
from
that
China
Lobby
which
,
I
was
assured
in
Moscow
nearly
two
years
ago
,
exists
on
the
quiet
inside
the
party
.

To
these
people
,
solidarity
and
unity
with
China
should
be
the
real
basis
of
Russia's
future
policy
.

And
the
Chinese
,
as
the
Albanian
incident
shows
,
have
strong
suspicions
that
Khrushchev
is
anxious
to
secure
a
shameful
peace
with
the
West
.

And
this
brings
us
inevitably
to
the
30-
or
50-megaton
bomb
.

Perhaps
Khrushchev
is
in
a
more
difficult
position
than
any
since
1957
,
when
the
anti-party
group
nearly
liquidated
him
.

The
next
days
may
show
where
things
stand
.

Undismayed
by
this
contretemps
,
a
small
band
of
the
faithful
gathered
at
Lauchli's
home
at
6:30
A.M.
the
next
day
,
put
on
their
uniforms
,
and
headed
for
a
farm
several
miles
away
.

A
60
mm.
mortar
and
a
57
mm.
recoilless
rifle
owned
by
Lauchli
were
brought
along
.

After
a
tortuous
drive
in
an
open
truck
and
a
World
War
2
,
army
jeep
down
soggy
trails
,
the
band
arrived
at
a
small
clearing
squeezed
between
a
long
,
low
ridge
and
a
creek-filled
gully
.

The
Minutemen
were
instructed
in
the
use
of
terrain
for
concealment
.

as
a
result
buyers
,
the
public
,
must
be
satisfied
with
second-rate
teachers
.

Since
the
goal
of
our
international
planners
is
a
World
Government
,
this
Atlantic
Community
would
mark
a
giant
step
in
that
direction
for
,
once
American
economic
autonomy
is
absorbed
,
a
larger
grouping
is
a
question
of
time
.

But
the
solution
to
this
dilemma
is
not
the
incorporation
of
the
United
States
into
an
Atlantic
Community
or
economic
empire
,
but
merely
what
libertarians
like
Henry
Hazlitt
and
Ludwig
Von
Mises
have
been
arguing
for
years
:
an
end
to
government
regulations
,
an
end
to
government
competition
in
industry
,
and
a
realistic
depreciation
allowance
for
industry
.

Create
a
free
market
here
,
give
us
a
sound
,
debt-free
money
system
,
and
we'll
compete
with
anyone
,
Europe
and
Asia
combined
.

not
acquiesce
to
an
international
planning
board
.

If
we
go
into
this
Common
Market
,
we
might
just
as
well
stop
talking
about
Constitutional
guarantees
,
Connally
Amendments
or
,
for
that
matter
,
conservatism
in
general
.

Now
,
more
than
five
years
later
,
I
cannot
in
any
realistic
sense
be
called
a
trained
soldier
.

However
,
it
seems
axiomatic
that
the
government
has
an
obligation
to
exercise
its
mandate
reasonably
,
equitably
and
with
full
regard
for
the
disruptions
which
it
inevitably
causes
.

In
the
issue
of
March
5
,
1960
you
had
an
excellent
editorial
which
said
:

I
found
recently
a
very
small
article
in
the
New
York
Times
:

U.S.
Flier
Loses
Plea
.

Pope
was
convicted
last
year
of
having
aided
North
Celebes
rebels
by
flying
bombing
missions
.

He
may
appeal
to
President
Sukarno
for
clemency
.

In
defeating
Louis
Capet
,
John
Tower's
victory
in
Texas
signals
,
once
again
,
the
end
of
the
divine
right
of
Liberalism
.

This
affects
us
all
intimately
,
and
can
leave
us
hopeless
in
the
face
of
widespread
distress
.

The
editorial
Confrontation
was
certainly
direct
in
its
appeal
to
those
of
us
living
here
in
America
.

N.C.'s
editorial
Confrontation
is
a
stunning
piece
of
writing
.

The
important
people
to
humanity
are
not
the
Khrushchevs
and
the
Castros
but
the
Schweitzers
and
the
Dooleys
,
and
the
others
like
them
whose
names
we
will
never
know
.

Lester
Markel
is
on
the
right
track
in
his
article
Interpretation
Of
Interpretation
(
SR
,
Mar.
11
)
.

Despite
several
years
of
front-page
stories
,
the
average
citizen
was
unable
to
get
a
complete
picture
of
McCarthy
until
he
saw
on
the
television
screen
what
the
reporters
had
been
seeing
all
along
but
had
no
effective
way
of
communicating
.

You
have
on
more
than
one
occasion
praised
the
idea
of
a
televised
press
conference
and
the
chance
it
gives
the
people
to
form
intelligent
opinions
.

Toward
the
end
of
the
war
,
we
really
felt
that
we
had
learned
something
about
propaganda
and
how
to
teach
it
.

Let
the
media
clean
house
,
too

Whether
in
his
forthcoming
book
C.
P.
Snow
commits
the
errors
of
judgment
and
of
fact
with
which
your
heavily
autobiographical
critic
charged
him
is
important
.

I
have
read
an
advance
copy
of
the
Snow
book
which
is
to
be
titled
,
'
Science
And
Government
.

Until
the
work
actually
appears
I
am
not
privileged
to
analyze
it
publicly
in
detail
.

The
article
presents
the
reader
with
an
absurdity
at
its
beginning
.

It
submits
an
enthusiastic
,
impressionistic
conception
of
Lindemann
contributing
another
aspect
of
the
man
,
but
on
no
more
authoritative
basis
than
Sir
Charles'
account
.

Certainly
not
in
Orchestra
Hall
where
he
has
played
countless
recitals
,
and
where
Thursday
night
he
celebrated
his
20th
season
with
the
Chicago
Symphony
Orchestra
,
playing
the
Brahms
Concerto
with
his
own
slashing
,
demon-ridden
cadenza
melting
into
the
high
,
pale
,
pure
and
lovely
song
with
which
a
violinist
unlocks
the
heart
of
the
music
,
or
forever
finds
it
closed
.

There
was
about
that
song
something
incandescent
,
for
this
Brahms
was
Milstein
at
white
heat
.

But
Mr.
Hendl
does
not
go
straight
to
any
point
.

There
was
in
the
Brahms
none
of
the
mysterious
and
marvelous
alchemy
by
which
a
great
conductor
can
bring
soloist
,
orchestra
and
music
to
ultimate
fusion
.

Remember
how
by
lack
of
two
big
theaters
Chicago
missed
the
first
visit
of
the
Royal
Danish
Ballet
?
?

The
engagement
was
supposed
to
be
all
set
for
the
big
theater
in
McCormick
Place
,
which
Sol
Hurok
,
ballet
booker
extraordinary
,
considers
the
finest
house
of
its
kind
in
the
country
--
and
of
course
he
doesn't
weep
at
the
capacity
,
either
.

It
was
all
set
.

Shorter
booking
,
but
still
a
booking
.

A
couple
of
days
later
a
balletomane
told
me
he
had
telephoned
Allied
Arts
for
ticket
information
and
was
told
the
newspapers
had
made
a
mistake
.

These
are
the
results
.

Well
,
Dietrich
won't
budge
from
McCormick
Place
.

Queried
about
the
impasse
,
Allied
Arts
said
:
Better
cancel
the
Kirov
for
the
time
being
.

In
the
line
of
operatic
trades
to
cushion
the
budget
,
the
Dallas
Civic
Opera
will
use
San
Francisco's
new
Leni
Bauer-Ecsy
production
of
Lucia
Di
Lammermoor
this
season
,
returning
the
favor
next
season
when
San
Francisco
uses
the
Dallas
Don
Giovanni
,
designed
by
Franco
Zeffirelli
.

Well
,
Jerebohm
and
his
wife
Pinkie
have
reached
the
stage
of
affluence
that
stirs
a
longing
for
the
more
atrociously
expensive
rustic
simplicities
.

The
name
of
it
is
Gore
Court
,
and
it
is
surrounded
by
a
wasteland
that
would
impress
T.
S.
Eliot
.

He
suggests
that
Gore
Court
embodies
all
the
glories
of
Tudor
splendor
.

The
vast
,
dungeon
kitchens
may
seem
hardly
worth
using
except
on
occasions
when
one
is
faced
with
a
thousand
unexpected
guests
for
lunch
.

Also
,
perhaps
,
table-tennis
and
other
indoor
sports
to
keep
them
fit
and
contented
.

When
he
needs
money
to
buy
something
like
,
say
,
the
Rolls-Royce
he
keeps
near
his
vegetable
patch
,
he
takes
a
flyer
in
the
sale
of
surplus
army
supplies
.

And
the
Jerebohms
are
more
than
willing
to
buy
it
.

If
,
in
Larkin's
eyes
,
they
are
nothing
but
Piccadilly
farmers
,
he
has
as
much
to
learn
about
them
as
they
have
to
learn
about
the
ways
of
truly
rural
living
.

Oneupmanship
is
practiced
by
both
sides
in
a
total
war
.

One
of
the
local
callers
,
a
retired
brigadier
apparently
left
over
from
Kipling's
tales
of
India
,
does
not
approve
of
the
way
Larkin
gets
his
birds
.

He
doesn't
think
that
potting
them
from
a
deck
chair
on
the
south
side
of
the
house
with
a
quart
glass
of
beer
for
sustenance
is
entirely
sporting
.

His
addle-brained
knight-errant
,
self-appointed
to
the
ridiculous
position
in
an
age
when
armor
had
already
been
relegated
to
museums
and
the
chivalrous
code
of
knight-errantry
had
become
a
joke
,
is
,
as
Cervantes
no
doubt
intended
,
a
gaunt
but
gracious
symbol
of
good
,
moving
soberly
and
sincerely
in
a
world
of
cynics
,
hypocrites
and
rogues
.

The
voices
of
all
the
characters
,
including
that
of
Cherkasov
,
have
richness
,
roughness
or
color
to
conform
with
the
personalities
.

Since
Russian
was
being
spoken
instead
of
Spanish
,
there
is
no
violation
of
artistry
or
logic
here
.

There
are
other
good
representations
of
peasants
and
people
of
the
court
by
actors
who
are
finely
costumed
and
magnificently
photographed
in
this
last
of
the
Russian
films
to
reach
this
country
in
the
program
of
joint
cultural
exchange
.

At
least
this
seemed
to
be
the
working
hypothesis
for
Chicago
And
All
That
Jazz
,
presented
on
NBC-TV
Nov.
26
.

About
that
same
time
John
Crosby's
TV
series
on
the
popular
arts
proved
again
that
giving
jazz
ample
breathing
space
is
one
of
the
most
sensible
things
a
producer
can
do
.

The
program
had
been
arranged
to
permit
the
establishment
of
a
mood
of
intense
concentration
on
the
music
.

Chicago
And
All
That
Jazz
could
not
be
faulted
on
the
choice
of
artists
.

The
jazz
buff
could
hardly
ask
for
more
.

Furthermore
,
Garry
Moore
makes
an
ideal
master
of
ceremonies
.

One
of
the
script's
big
problems
was
how
to
blend
pictures
and
music
of
the
past
with
live
performances
by
musicians
of
today
.

Similarly
,
in
presenting
still
photographs
of
early
jazz
groups
,
the
program
allowed
no
time
for
a
close
perusal
.

Still
,
the
network's
willingness
to
experiment
in
this
musical
field
is
to
be
commended
,
and
future
essays
happily
anticipated
.

Even
Joan
Sutherland
may
not
have
anticipated
the
tremendous
reception
she
received
from
the
Metropolitan
Opera
audience
attending
her
debut
as
Lucia
in
Donizetti's
Lucia
Di
Lammermoor
Sunday
night
.

Her
entrance
in
Scene
2
,
Act
1
,
brought
some
disconcerting
applause
even
before
she
had
sung
a
note
.

As
she
gained
composure
during
the
second
act
,
her
technical
resourcefulness
emerged
stronger
,
though
she
had
already
revealed
a
trill
almost
unprecedented
in
years
of
performances
of
Lucia
.

Each
high
note
had
the
crowd
in
ecstasy
so
that
it
stopped
the
show
midway
in
the
Mad
Scene
,
but
the
real
reason
was
a
realization
of
the
extraordinary
performance
unfolding
at
the
moment
.

Miss
Sutherland
appeared
almost
as
another
person
in
this
scene
:
A
much
more
girlish
Lucia
,
a
sensational
coloratura
who
ran
across
stage
while
singing
,
and
an
actress
immersed
in
her
role
.

He
may
respect
too
much
the
Italian
tradition
of
letting
singers
hold
on
to
their
notes
,
but
to
restrain
them
in
a
singers'
opera
may
be
quite
difficult
.

His
bel
canto
style
gave
the
performance
a
special
distinction
.

Complete
with
crowd
effects
,
interruptions
by
jet
planes
,
and
sundry
other
touches
of
realism
,
this
disc
displays
London's
new
technique
to
the
best
effect
.

No
reference
is
made
to
the
possibility
of
recording
other
than
popular
music
in
this
manner
,
and
it
would
not
seem
to
lend
itself
well
to
serious
music
.

but
when
the
sounds
of
the
two
speakers
are
allowed
to
mix
,
there
is
excellent
depth
and
dimension
to
the
music
.

Only
too
often
,
however
,
you
have
the
feeling
that
you
are
sitting
in
a
room
with
some
of
the
instruments
lined
up
on
one
wall
to
your
left
and
others
facing
them
on
the
wall
to
your
right
.

Pass
In
Review
practically
guarantees
enjoyment
,
and
is
a
dramatic
demonstration
of
the
potentialities
of
any
stereo
music
system
.

During
the
making
recently
of
an
important
Biblical
film
,
some
40
volumes
of
research
material
and
sketches
not
only
of
costumes
and
interiors
,
but
of
architectural
developments
,
sports
arenas
,
vehicles
,
and
other
paraphernalia
were
compiled
,
consulted
,
and
complied
with
.

Thus
,
in
The
Story
Of
Ruth
we
have
Ruth
,
Naomi
,
and
Boaz
and
sets
that
are
meticulously
authentic
.

Earlier
this
month
Edward
R.
Murrow
,
director
of
the
United
States
Information
Agency
,
came
to
Hollywood
and
had
dinner
with
more
than
100
leaders
of
the
motion
picture
industry
.

The
work's
two
movements
,
one
melodically
sentimental
,
the
other
brightly
capricious
,
are
clever
enough
in
a
Ravel-like
style
,
but
they
rehash
a
wornout
idiom
.

Works
by
Dohnanyi
,
Hubay
,
Mr.
D'Albert
himself
and
Paganini
,
indicated
that
the
violinist
had
some
virtuoso
fireworks
up
his
sleeve
as
well
as
a
reserved
attitude
toward
a
lyric
phrase
.

In
recent
years
Anna
Xydis
has
played
with
the
New
York
Philharmonic
and
at
Lewisohn
Stadium
,
but
her
program
last
night
at
Town
Hall
was
the
Greek-born
pianist's
first
New
York
recital
since
1948
.

And
the
tone
she
commands
is
always
beautiful
in
sound
.

Since
she
also
has
considerable
technical
virtuosity
and
a
feeling
for
music
in
the
romantic
tradition
,
Miss
Xydis
gave
her
listeners
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
.

She
played
with
style
and
a
touch
of
the
grand
manner
,
and
every
piece
she
performed
was
especially
effective
in
its
closing
measures
.

Haydn's
Sonata
in
E
minor
,
which
was
unfailingly
pleasant
in
sound
,
and
Chopin's
Sonata
in
B
flat
minor
.

A
memory
lapse
in
the
last
somewhat
marred
the
pianist's
performance
.

He
returned
in
command
of
an
international
army
of
Gurkhas
,
Indians
,
Africans
,
Chinese
and
British
.

Field
Marshal
Slim
is
striking
in
description
,
amusing
in
many
anecdotes
.

Before
he
could
return
to
Burma
,
Field
Marshal
Slim
had
to
rally
the
defeated
remnants
of
a
discouraged
army
and
unite
them
with
fresh
recruits
.

and

;
;

Of
the
Japanese
private
he
says
:
He
fought
and
marched
till
he
died
.

If
500
Japanese
were
ordered
to
hold
a
position
,
we
had
to
kill
495
before
it
was
ours
--
and
then
the
last
five
killed
themselves
.

Their
singing
was
well-balanced
,
clear
and
,
within
obvious
limitations
,
extremely
pleasing
.

But
Mr.
Bragg
is
a
remarkably
gifted
conductor
,
and
the
results
he
has
produced
with
his
boys
are
generally
superior
.

Furthermore
,
there
were
solid
musical
virtues
in
the
interpretation
of
the
music
.

The
piano
accompaniments
by
Istvan
Szelenyi
were
stylish
.

The
combination
proved
quite
irresistible
last
night
.

A
thoroughly
ingratiating
company
it
is
,
and
when
the
final
curtain
falls
you
may
suddenly
realize
that
you
have
been
sitting
with
a
broad
grin
on
your
face
all
evening
.

But
under
the
direction
of
Mira
Ziminska-Sygietynska
,
who
with
her
late
husband
founded
the
organization
in
1948
,
it
has
all
been
put
into
theatrical
form
,
treated
selectively
,
choreographed
specifically
for
presentation
to
spectators
,
and
performed
altogether
professionally
.

They
can
be
exuberant
or
sentimental
,
flirtatious
or
funny
,
but
the
only
thing
they
seem
unable
to
be
is
dull
.

and
the
dances
and
songs
from
the
Tatras
contain
a
magnificent
dance
for
the
men
.

The
Theatre-by-the-Sea
,
Matunuck
,
presents
King
Of
Hearts
by
Jean
Kerr
and
Eleanor
Brooke
.

This
is
when
his
troubles
begin
,
not
to
mention
a
fledgling
artist
who
he
hires
,
and
who
turns
out
to
have
ideas
of
his
own
,
with
particular
respect
to
the
hero's
sweetheart-secretary
.

He
does
,
and
more
.

A
word
should
be
said
for
Gary
Morgan
,
a
Broadway
youngster
who
,
as
the
adopted
son
,
makes
life
miserable
for
nearly
everybody
and
Larkin
in
particular
.

And
for
his
playmate
,
Francis
Coletta
of
West
Warwick
,
who
has
a
bit
part
,
Billy
.

It
is
a
tremendous
book
,
lively
,
constantly
moving
,
and
the
Matunuck
cast
does
well
by
it
.

The
Newport
Playhouse
presents
Epitaph
For
George
Dillon
by
John
Osborne
and
Anthony
Creighton
,
directed
by
Wallace
Gray
.

This
is
an
exciting
young
actor
to
watch
.

The
Warwick
Musical
Theater
presents
Where's
Charley
?
?

In
brief
,
Berman
played
himself
and
not
Bolger
.

The
whole
production
this
week
is
fresh
and
lively
.

The
Broadway
Theater
League
of
Rhode
Island
presents
C.
Edwin
Knill's
and
Martin
Tahse's
production
of
Fiorello
!
!

Certainly
in
the
matter
of
principals
there
is
nothing
lacking
.

I
am
glad
to
say
there's
none
of
that
distraction
in
this
Fiorello
!
!

If
most
of
them
weren't
exactly
specific
--
well
,
that's
the
way
it
is
in
life
,
I
guess
.

I
was
delighted
with
Paula
Prentiss'
comedy
performance
,
which
was
as
fresh
and
unstilted
as
one's
highest
hopes
might
ask
.

To
anyone
who
remembers
Newport
at
its
less
than
maximum
violence
,
this
view
of
what
the
boys
and
girls
do
in
the
springtime
before
they
wing
north
for
the
Jazz
Festival
ought
to
prove
entertaining
.

The
second
feature
,
The
Price
Of
Silence
,
is
a
British
detective
story
that
will
talk
your
head
off
.

To
both
persons
and
ideas
he
brought
the
same
delighted
interest
,
the
same
open-minded
relish
for
what
was
unique
in
each
,
the
same
discriminating
sensibility
and
quicksilver
intelligence
,
the
same
gallantry
of
judgment
.

This
is
a
virtue
of
which
we
have
great
need
in
a
society
where
there
seems
to
be
an
increasing
lack
of
communication
--
or
even
desire
for
communication
--
between
differing
schools
of
thought
.

But
there
is
a
dignity
and
even
a
hint
of
the
inspired
prophet
in
his
words
to
one
correspondent
:
You
ask
what
I
am
going
to
'
reply
'
to
Bradley
.

I
think
that
readers
generally
hate
minute
polemics
and
recriminations
.

The
one
unifying
note
,
if
any
,
is
sounded
in
the
initial
article
entitled
:
How
To
Get
Through
The
Day
.

A
tribute
to
midsummer
bang-sashes
seems
terribly
funny
,
though
it
would
be
hard
to
explain
why
.

'
Thank
God
for
that
'
,
I
said
;
;

But
there
is
a
difference
between
the
present
volume
and
the
early
Low
.

This
is
drama
enough
.

that
was
a
nightmarish
situation
and
Low
was
in
his
element
.

Now
we
have
stood
up
to
the
Communists
;
;

He
writes
,
Confucius
held
that
in
times
of
stress
one
should
take
short
views
--
only
up
to
lunchtime
.

He
does
not
seem
to
have
caught
the
subtleties
of
the
man
.

Instead
the
cartoons
seem
to
deal
with
foibles
.

He
showed
puny
men
attacked
by
splendidly
tyrannical
machines
.

But
like
all
despots
,
as
he
builds
his
following
from
among
the
gullible
,
he
grows
more
threatening
toward
those
who
won't
follow
--
such
solid
citizens
as
Doc
Raccoon
;
;

Judge
Black
,
the
vegetarian
black
snake
;
;

and
the
eagle
,
who
leads
the
bird
community
when
he
is
not
too
busy
in
Washington
posing
for
fifty-cent
pieces
.

Robert
Hillyer
,
the
poet
,
writes
in
his
introduction
to
this
brief
animal
fable
that
Mr.
Burman
ought
to
win
a
Nobel
Prize
for
the
Catfish
Bend
series
.

A
veteran
diplomat
with
an
extraordinary
knowledge
of
Russian
language
,
history
and
literature
,
Kennan
recalls
how
,
at
the
time
of
Hitler's
attack
on
the
Soviet
Union
in
1941
,
he
penned
a
private
note
to
a
State
Department
official
,
expressing
the
hope
that
never
would
we
associate
ourselves
with
Russian
purposes
in
the
areas
of
eastern
Europe
beyond
her
own
boundaries
.

With
justified
bitterness
the
author
speaks
of
what
seems
to
me
to
have
been
an
inexcusable
body
of
ignorance
about
the
nature
of
the
Russian
Communist
movement
,
about
the
history
of
its
diplomacy
,
about
what
had
happened
in
the
purges
,
and
about
what
had
been
going
on
in
Poland
and
the
Baltic
States
.

They
attributed
everything
that
went
wrong
in
Russia
to
German
influence
and
intrigue
.

a
man
in
whose
entourage
none
was
ever
safe
;
;

Mr.
Kennan
,
who
has
recently
abandoned
authorship
for
a
new
round
of
diplomacy
as
the
recently
appointed
American
ambassador
to
Yugoslavia
,
is
not
the
only
man
who
finds
it
easier
to
portray
the
past
than
to
prescribe
for
the
future
.

But
Innesfree
,
where
Ellen
Roe
Danaher
and
her
bullying
brother
,
Will
,
live
,
is
no
place
for
a
man
who
will
not
use
his
fists
.

His
matchmaking
is
,
naturally
,
incidental
,
and
it
only
serves
Flynn
right
when
a
determined
widow
takes
him
by
the
ear
and
leads
him
off
to
matrimony
.

she
fits
into
the
general
scheme
well
enough
.

There
is
no
reason
why
most
theatergoers
should
not
have
a
pretty
good
time
at
Donnybrook
,
unless
they
are
permanently
in
the
mood
of
Enright
when
he
sings
about
how
easily
he
could
hate
the
lovable
Irish
.

The
fans
of
the
musical
were
,
too
.

Whether
fan
of
the
Pagnol
films
or
stage
show
,
whether
partial
to
music
or
not
,
you
can't
help
but
derive
joy
from
this
picture
if
you
have
a
sense
of
humor
and
a
heart
.

He
did
not
let
the
strings
,
for
instance
,
weep
,
whine
or
get
hysterical
.

An
impressive
technician
,
Mr.
Skolovsky
has
fine
rhythm
,
to
boot
.

But
granted
all
this
,
one
still
would
have
liked
to
have
heard
a
little
more
tonal
nuance
than
Mr.
Skolovsky
supplied
.

Mr.
Skolovsky
fully
deserved
the
warm
reception
he
received
.

A
new
work
on
the
program
was
Nikolai
Lopatnikoff's
Festival
Overture
,
receiving
its
first
New
York
hearing
.

This
was
composed
last
year
as
a
salute
to
the
automobile
industry
.

And
so
,
of
course
,
it
is
a
fan's
opera
as
well
.

After
all
,
the
opera
has
juicy
music
to
sing
and
the
goodies
are
well
distributed
,
with
no
less
than
six
leading
parts
.

Laura
is
a
good
role
for
Miss
Resnik
,
and
she
gave
it
force
,
dramatic
color
and
passion
.

unfortunately
his
voice
was
out
of
focus
and
often
spread
in
quality
.

The
English
have
managed
to
hold
onto
their
madrigal
tradition
better
than
anyone
else
.

Latter-day
interest
in
Elizabethan
singing
dates
well
back
into
the
nineteenth
century
in
England
,
much
ahead
of
similar
revivals
in
other
countries
.

As
a
result
no
comparable
literature
of
the
period
is
better
known
and
better
studied
nor
more
often
performed
than
the
English
madrigal
.

Only
with
the
more
sensual
,
intense
and
baroque
expressions
of
Marenzio
,
Monteverdi
and
Gesualdo
does
the
singing
seem
a
little
superficial
.

Rameau's
Six
Concerts
En
Sextuor
,
recorded
by
L'orchestre
De
Chambre
Pierre
Menet
(
BAM
LD
046
)
,
turn
out
to
be
harpsichord
pieces
arranged
for
strings
apparently
by
the
composer
himself
.

Since
rococo
music
tends
to
be
pretty
and
elegant
above
all
,
it
can
seem
rather
vacuous
to
twentieth-century
ears
that
have
grown
accustomed
to
the
stress
and
dissonances
of
composers
from
Beethoven
to
Boulez
.

What
a
silly
,
artificial
way
of
life
,
Chabrier
and
his
librettists
chuckle
.

Chabrier's
delightful
music
stands
just
at
the
point
where
the
classical
,
rationalist
tradition
,
(
handed
down
to
Chabrier
largely
in
the
form
of
operetta
and
salon
music
)
becomes
virtually
neo-classicism
.

Arlene
Saunders
was
charming
as
poor
Gontran
.

the
work
uses
the
old
eighteenth-century
tradition
of
giving
the
part
of
a
young
inexperienced
youth
to
a
soprano
.

Benita
Valente
was
delightful
as
the
young
wife
and
John
Parella
was
amusing
as
the
tutor
who
failed
to
do
all
his
tutoring
.

Had
a
funny
experience
at
Newport
yesterday
afternoon
.

Judy
Garland
has
arrived
in
London
.

But
who
cares
,
when
the
lady
sings
?
?

And
Judy
sang
the
lovely
old
familiar
things
which
seemed
,
at
times
,
a
blessed
relief
from
the
way-out
compositions
of
the
progressive
jazzmen
who
have
dominated
these
proceedings
.

Things
like
When
You
are
Smiling
,
Almost
Like
Being
In
Love
,
Do
It
Again
,
Born
To
Wander
,
Alone
Together
,
Who
Cares
?
?

Miss
Garland
is
not
only
one
of
the
great
singers
of
our
time
but
she
is
one
of
the
superb
showmen
.

At
the
start
of
her
program
there
were
evidences
of
pique
.

Along
about
4:30
,
just
when
it
was
getting
to
be
about
time
to
turn
the
audience
over
and
toast
them
on
the
other
side
,
Judy
came
on
singing
,
in
a
short-skirted
blue
dress
with
a
blue
and
white
jacket
that
flapped
in
the
wind
.

Before
her
chore
was
finished
she
was
rescuing
wind-blown
sheets
of
music
,
trundling
microphones
about
the
stage
,
helping
to
move
the
piano
and
otherwise
joining
in
the
informal
atmosphere
.

Sometimes
they
struck
me
as
horribly
over-arranged
--
which
was
the
way
I
felt
about
her
Come
Rain
or
Come
Shine
--
and
sometimes
they
were
just
plain
magnificent
,
like
her
shatteringly
beautiful
Beautiful
Weather
.

The
audience
wouldn't
let
her
leave
until
it
had
heard
Over
The
Rainbow
--
although
the
fellow
that
kept
crying
for
Get
Happy
had
to
go
home
unhappy
,
about
that
item
anyway
.

In
Newport
last
night
there
were
flashes
of
distant
lightning
in
the
northern
skies
.

Several
times
it
came
near
breaking
,
and
there
were
in
fact
some
lovely
peals
of
thunder
from
Jerry
Mulligan's
big
band
,
which
is
about
as
fine
an
aggregation
as
has
come
along
in
the
jazz
business
since
John
Hammond
found
Count
Basie
working
in
a
Kansas
City
trap
.

For
subtle
swinging
rhythms
,
I
could
admire
intensely
Mulligan's
version
of
Weep
,
and
the
fireworks
went
on
display
in
18
Carrots
For
Robert
,
a
sax
tribute
to
Johnny
Hodges
.

A
few
drops
of
rain
just
before
midnight
,
when
Sarah
Vaughan
was
in
the
midst
of
her
first
number
,
scattered
the
more
timid
members
of
the
audience
briefly
,
but
at
this
hour
and
with
Sarah
on
the
stand
,
most
of
the
listeners
didn't
care
whether
they
got
wet
.

He
plays
his
sax
principally
for
beauty
of
tone
,
rather
than
for
scintillating
flights
of
meaningless
improvisations
,
and
he
has
a
quiet
way
of
getting
back
and
restating
the
melody
after
the
improvising
is
over
.

One
of
those
delightful
surprise
additions
,
which
so
frequently
occur
in
jazz
programs
,
was
an
excellent
stint
at
the
drums
by
the
great
Joe
Jones
,
drumming
to
Old
Man
River
,
which
seems
to
have
been
elected
the
favorite
solo
for
the
boys
on
the
batterie
at
this
year's
concerts
.

Pony
Poindexter
,
alto
sax
;
;

Rhythmic
interest
,
melodic
beauty
and
the
expansiveness
of
the
writing
are
all
qualities
which
hold
one's
attention
with
the
Gilels
playing
.

Do
you
say
chantey
,
as
if
the
word
were
derived
from
the
French
word
chanter
,
to
sing
,
or
do
you
say
shanty
and
think
of
a
roughly
built
cabin
,
which
derives
its
name
from
the
French-Canadian
use
of
the
word
chantier
,
with
one
of
its
meanings
given
as
a
boat-yard
?
?

Murray
Louis
and
his
dance
company
appeared
at
the
Henry
Street
Playhouse
on
Friday
and
Saturday
evenings
and
Sunday
afternoons
in
the
premiere
of
his
latest
work
,
Signal
,
and
the
repetition
of
an
earlier
one
,
Journal
.

It
may
be
,
of
course
,
that
Mr.
Louis
is
consciously
trying
to
create
works
that
anticipate
an
age
of
total
automation
.

Eugene
Lester
assembled
a
witty
and
explicit
score
for
An
American
Journey
,
and
Malcolm
McCormick
gave
it
sprightly
imaginative
costumes
.

The
places
could
be
anywhere
,
the
idiosyncrasies
and
foibles
observed
there
could
be
anybody's
,
and
the
laugh
is
on
us
all
.

Unfortunately
,
the
man
and
woman
were
not
made
to
appear
very
interesting
at
the
outset
and
the
menacing
figures
failed
to
make
them
any
more
so
.

Nor
did
the
dancing
involved
really
seize
the
attention
at
any
time
.

The
music
here
,
Russell
Smith's
Tetrameron
,
sounded
good
.

At
the
same
time
the
orchestra
announced
that
next
season
it
would
be
giving
twenty-five
programs
at
Carnegie
,
and
that
it
would
be
taking
these
concerts
to
the
suburbs
,
repeating
each
of
them
in
five
different
communities
.

Igor
Oistrakh
will
be
the
next
soloist
on
Feb.
4
.

In
the
more
casually
constructed
musicals
of
the
Nineteen
Twenties
and
Nineteen
Thirties
there
would
seem
to
have
been
less
reason
for
eliminating
a
song
of
merit
.

It
was
heard
again
in
Philadelphia
in
1927
in
the
first
version
of
Strike
Up
The
Band
and
again
abandoned
shortly
before
the
entire
show
was
given
up
.

Like
the
Gershwins
,
Richard
Rodgers
and
Lorenz
Hart
were
loath
to
let
a
good
song
get
away
from
them
.

Turning
to
the
current
musical
season
on
Broadway
,
the
most
widely
acclaimed
of
the
new
arrivals
,
How
To
Succeed
In
Business
Without
Really
Trying
,
has
been
transferred
to
an
original
cast
album
(
R.
C.
A.
Victor
LOC
1066
;
;

stereo
LSO
1065
)
,
but
in
this
case
it
is
the
music
that
stands
above
the
lyrics
.

stereo
SWAO
1643
)
,
a
saga
of
life
on
a
cruise
ship
that
is
not
apt
to
be
included
among
Mr.
Coward's
more
memorable
works
.

Tenderly
and
rather
tediously
,
the
camera
rivets
on
the
abrupt
,
deep
love
of
a
pretty
nurse
and
a
uniformed
teacher
,
complicated
by
nothing
more
than
a
friend
they
don't
want
to
hurt
.

Only
once
in
a
very
long
while
comes
a
book
that
gives
the
reader
a
magic
sense
of
sharing
a
rare
experience
.

A
year
and
a
day
of
this
idyll
is
described
for
the
reader
,
one
in
which
not
only
discovery
of
a
new
world
of
personality
is
charted
,
but
self-discovery
as
well
.

Yet
the
idyll
ended
.

They
serve
to
contradict
a
popular
notion
that
the
Comedie
merely
repeats
,
as
accurately
as
possible
,
the
techniques
of
acting
the
classics
that
prevailed
in
the
17th
century
.

The
directors
of
the
Comedie
do
not
respond
to
adverse
notices
in
as
docile
and
subservient
a
manner
as
the
Broadway
producers
who
,
in
two
instances
this
season
,
closed
their
plays
after
one
performance
.

Apparently
,
Jouvet
and
Ledoux
attempted
just
these
dissimilar
approaches
in
the
role
of
Arnolphe
in
The
School
For
Wives
.

Louis
Seigner
,
who
formerly
played
the
deluded
benefactor
opposite
Ledoux
,
is
the
Tartuffe
of
the
present
production
,
which
he
himself
directed
.

His
red
face
,
his
coarse
gestures
,
and
his
lustful
stares
bespeak
his
sensuality
.

Seigner
,
however
,
is
a
fine
actor
and
probably
the
busiest
man
in
the
company
;
;

Here
some
innovation
is
attempted
.

And
surely
his
Scapin
has
a
fresh
directness
,
a
no-nonsense
quality
that
seems
to
make
him
his
own
master
and
nobody's
servant
.

There
is
hardly
a
jazz
guitarist
in
the
business
today
who
doesn't
owe
something
to
Django
.

It
was
the
first
jazz
he
had
heard
.

You
can
catch
up
with
him
--
if
you
haven't
already
--
on
RCA-Victor's
album
.

They

:
Minor
Swing

Kid
Ory
,
the
trombonist
chicken
farmer
,
is
also
one
of
the
solid
anchor
points
of
jazz
.

He
is
starred
against
Alvin
Alcorn
,
trumpet
;
;

Julian
Davidson
,
guitar
;
;

All
this
will
serve
to
show
off
the
Ory
style
in
fine
fashion
and
is
a
must
for
those
who
want
to
collect
elements
of
the
old-time
jazz
before
it
is
too
late
to
lay
hands
on
the
gems
.

That
is
an
evening
of
music-making
that
would
faze
many
a
younger
man
;
;

so
was
the
playing
.

like
his
sweet
,
attractive
Romanza
,
it
belongs
to
what
the
composer
called
his
Non-Dissonant
(
Mostly
)
category
of
works
.

In
its
present
artless
,
low-budget
form
,
the
subject
matter
seems
designed
to
invite
censorial
wrath
.

After
a
protracted
,
hysterical
trial
scene
more
notable
for
the
frankness
of
its
language
than
for
dramatic
credibility
,
the
jury
,
to
no
one's
surprise
,
leaves
the
legal
question
unresolved
.

At
the
end
of
the
program
,
indeed
,
there
was
a
demonstration
that
lasted
for
forty-five
minutes
,
and
nothing
could
stop
it
.

But
for
all
the
manifest
intention
to
show
off
,
this
was
a
circus
with
a
difference
,
for
instead
of
descending
in
quality
to
what
is
known
as
a
popular
level
,
it
added
further
to
the
evidence
that
this
is
a
very
great
dancing
company
.

What
a
man
this
Petipa
was
!
!

This
scene
is
a
white
ballet
in
which
a
lovelorn
hero
searches
for
his
departed
love's
spirit
among
twenty-eight
extraordinarily
beautiful
shadows
who
can
all
dance
like
nothing
human
--
which
,
of
course
,
is
altogether
fitting
.

As
a
dramatic
narrative
The
Making
Of
The
President
1960
is
continuously
engrossing
.

The
author
begins
this
volume
with
a
close-up
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
his
family
and
his
entourage
waiting
for
the
returns
.

but
never
from
Mr.
Nixon
,
who
looked
on
reporters
with
suspicion
and
distrust
.

he
trusts
only
himself
and
his
wife
.

Every
decision
was
made
quickly
on
sound
grounds
.

One
such
moment
came
in
the
breathtaking
way
Miss
Pons
sang
the
cadenza
to
Meyerbeer's
Shadow
Song
.

Radio
is
easily
outdistancing
television
in
its
strides
to
reach
the
minority
listener
.

Advertisers
are
changing
their
attitudes
,
both
as
to
the
significance
of
this
market
and
the
ways
of
speaking
to
it
.

Futhermore
,
the
station
which
wants
real
prestige
must
lead
or
participate
in
community
improvement
projects
,
not
simply
serve
on
the
air
.

In
the
last
decade
the
number
of
Negro-appeal
radio
program
hours
has
risen
at
least
15
per
cent
,
and
the
number
of
Negro-appeal
stations
has
increased
30
per
cent
,
according
to
a
research
man
quoted
by
Sponsor
.

A
year
ago
the
Negro
Radio
Association
was
formed
to
spur
research
which
the
30-odd
member
stations
are
sure
will
bring
in
more
business
.

The
1960
census
underscored
the
explosive
character
of
the
population
growth
.

It
also
brought
home
proof
of
something
a
casual
observer
might
have
missed
:
that
more
than
half
of
the
U.S.
Negroes
live
outside
the
southeastern
states
.

In
New
York
City
,
WLIB
boasts
more
community
service
programs
than
any
other
Negro
station
and
one
of
the
largest
Negro
news
staffs
in
America
.

In
all
big
cities
outside
the
South
,
and
even
in
small
towns
within
the
South
,
radio
stations
can
be
found
beaming
some
or
all
of
their
programs
at
Negro
listeners
.

Advertisers
have
discovered
the
tendency
of
Negroes
to
shop
for
brand
names
they
have
heard
on
stations
catering
to
their
special
interests
.

Sponsor
quotes
John
McLendon
of
the
McLendon-Ebony
station
group
as
saying
that
the
Southern
Negro
is
becoming
conscious
of
quality
and
does
not
wish
to
be
associated
with
radio
which
is
any
way
degrading
to
his
race
;
;

he
tends
to
shy
away
from
the
hooting
and
hollering
personalities
that
originally
made
Negro
radio
programs
famous
.

It
will
continue
to
be
important
as
a
means
of
orientation
to
the
Negro
,
seeking
to
become
urbanized
,
as
he
tries
to
make
adjustment
to
the
urban
life
.

From
early
family
portraits
,
painted
before
he
entered
the
schools
of
the
Pennsylvania
Academy
of
the
Fine
Arts
,
the
chronology
extends
to
a
group
of
paintings
executed
in
his
last
year
(
1951
)
and
still
part
of
his
estate
.

As
early
as
1928
,
however
,
the
Sloan
style
began
to
change
.

Not
all
the
paintings
,
however
,
are
of
cities
.

There
are
151
items
in
the
Wilmington
show
,
including
one
painting
by
each
member
of
the
Eight
,
as
well
as
work
by
Sloan's
friends
and
students
.

Robert
Riefling
,
who
gave
the
only
piano
recital
of
the
recently
concluded
23rd
Beethoven
Festival
,
penetrated
deep
into
the
spirit
of
the
style
.

His
readings
were
careful
without
being
fussy
,
and
they
were
authoritative
without
being
presumptuous
.

The
D
Minor
Sonata
,
Op.
31
No.
2
,
introduced
by
dynamically
shaped
arpeggios
,
was
most
engaging
in
its
moments
of
quasi-recitative
--
single
lines
in
which
the
fingers
seemed
to
be
feeling
their
way
toward
the
idea
to
come
.

Herr
Wangenheim
has
only
recently
become
the
city's
music
director
,
and
is
a
young
man
with
a
clear
flair
for
the
podium
.

But
he
weighted
the
Eighth
Symphony
,
at
times
,
with
a
shuddering
subjectivity
which
seemed
considerably
at
odds
with
the
music
.

He
might
have
been
hoping
,
to
all
appearances
,
that
this
relatively
sunny
symphony
,
in
conjunction
with
the
Choral
Fantasy
at
the
end
of
the
program
,
could
amount
to
something
like
the
Ninth
;
;

The
concerto's
soloist
,
Hans
Richter-Haaser
,
played
with
compensatory
ease
and
economy
,
though
without
the
consummate
plasticity
to
which
we
had
been
treated
on
the
previous
evening
by
Herr
Riefling
.

The
entrance
of
the
Stadtisches
Gesangverein
(
Bonn's
civic
chorus
)
was
worth
all
the
waiting
,
however
,
as
the
young
Rhenish
voices
finally
brought
the
music
to
life
.

In
the
autumn
of
1959
,
the
British
Broadcasting
Corporation
presented
a
series
of
talks
by
four
scientists
competent
in
cosmology
.

Three
of
these
men
discussed
major
theories
of
the
universe
while
the
other
acted
as
a
moderator
.

Dr.
Whitrow
functioned
as
moderator
.

Dr.
Bonnor
begins
with
a
discussion
of
the
relativistic
theories
of
the
universe
,
based
on
the
general
theory
of
relativity
.

He
supports
the
steady-state
theory
which
holds
that
matter
is
continually
being
created
in
space
.

Now
if
one
hydrogen
atom
were
placed
at
the
surface
of
a
large
sphere
of
hydrogen
atoms
,
it
would
be
subject
both
to
the
gravitation
of
the
sphere
and
the
charge-excess
of
all
those
atoms
in
the
sphere
.

Presently
,
the
intense
absorption
of
ultra-violet
rays
in
the
earth's
atmosphere
seriously
hinders
ground
observation
.

They
care
no
more
for
politics
,
says
Mr.
Wesker
,
than
they
do
for
a
symphony
.

They
dwell
,
in
short
,
in
the
doltish
twilight
in
which
peasants
and
serfs
of
the
past
are
commonly
reported
to
have
lived
.

But
this
is
a
theme
which
does
not
take
so
much
time
to
state
as
Mr.
Wesker
dedicates
to
it
.

Beatie
,
getting
no
sympathy
for
her
misfortune
,
soon
rallies
and
finds
that
although
she
has
lost
a
lover
she
has
gained
her
freedom
.

Shakespeare
had
a
word
for
everything
,
even
for
the
rain
that
disrupted
Wednesday
night's
Much
Ado
About
Nothing
opening
the
season
of
free
theatre
in
Central
Park
.

Using
a
wide
stage
resourcefully
he
mingled
music
and
dance
with
Shakespeare's
words
in
a
spirited
mixture
.

The
simple-minded
comedy
of
Dogberry
and
Verges
,
also
familiar
in
a
day
that
responds
easily
to
jokes
skimmed
off
the
top
of
writers'
heads
,
evoked
laughter
.

But
the
rain
came
more
heavily
,
and
men
and
women
in
light
summer
clothes
began
to
depart
.

A
voice
on
the
loudspeaker
system
announced
that
if
the
rain
let
up
the
performance
would
resume
in
ten
minutes
.

More
than
half
the
audience
departed
.

The
heavens
refused
to
give
up
their
weeping
.

Put
to
the
service
of
lieder
of
Schubert
,
Brahms
,
Strauss
and
Wolf
in
a
dramatical
and
musical
way
,
it
made
its
effect
with
ease
and
precision
.

But
what
has
been
happening
recently
might
be
described
as
creeping
mannerism
.

The
symptoms
Saturday
night
were
unmistakable
.

Clever
light
songs
were
overly
coy
,
tragic
songs
a
little
too
melodramatic
.

There
were
stunning
musical
phrases
too
,
and
sometimes
the
deepest
kind
of
musical
and
poetic
absorption
and
communication
.

As
Brother
John
Sellers
sang
five
blues
to
the
guitar
and
drum
accompaniments
of
Bruce
Langhorne
and
Shep
Shepard
,
Mr.
Ailey
and
Miss
De
Lavallade
went
through
volatile
dances
that
were
by
turns
insinuating
,
threatening
,
contemptuous
and
ecstatic
.

The
result
is
rather
wonderful
,
but
so
rich
as
to
be
indigestible
if
taken
in
too
thick
slices
.

Most
of
them
were
written
between
1953
and
1960
and
originally
appeared
in
various
magazines
.

But
no
matter
what
he
writes
about
he
brings
to
his
subject
his
own
original
mind
and
his
own
sensitive
reactions
.

miles

;

Mr.
Sansom
can
be
eloquent
in
a
spectacular
way
which
recalls
(
to
those
who
recall
easily
)
the
statues
of
Bernini
and
the
gigantic
paintings
of
Tintoretto
.

In
one
of
his
best
essays
Mr.
Sansom
expresses
his
enthusiasm
for
the
many
country
mansions
designed
by
Andrea
Palladio
himself
that
dot
the
environs
of
Vicenza
.

How
far
that
pedimented
and
pillared
style
has
shed
its
influence
Mr.
Sansom
reminds
us
thus
:

and
,
in
addition
,
employs
an
avant-garde
structure
that
particularly
needs
to
be
seen
if
comprehension
is
to
be
encouraged

Somewhere
in
Mrs.
Reavey's
play

is
both
protest
and
aspiration
of
merit

of

As
autumn
starts
its
annual
sweep
,
few
Americans
and
Canadians
realize
how
fortunate
they
are
in
having
the
world's
finest
fall
coloring
.

in
fact
,
a
freezing
autumn
dulls
the
blaze
.

Below
is
a
specific
guide
,
keyed
to
the
calendar
.

Ontario's
foliage
is
most
vivid
from
about
Sept.
23
to
Oct.
10
,
with
both
Muskoka

100
miles
north
of
Toronto
)
and
Haliburton

In
Minnesota
,
Arrowhead
County
and

53
north
to

are
outstanding
.

Two
sharply
contrasting
places
designed

public

are
now
on

will
stay
up
until
they
are

A
deft
,
hilarious
satire
on
very
high
French
society
involving
a
statesman
with
two
enviable
possessions
,
a
lovely
young
bride
and
a
head
containing
such
weighty
thoughts
that
he
has
occasionally
to
remove
it
for
greater
comfort
.

There
is
probably
a
moral
in
all
this
about
mind
vs.
heart
.

Matter
Of

And

This
retelling
by
Louis
Zara
of
the
brief
,
anguished
life
of
Stephen
Crane
--
poet
and
master
novelist
at
23
,
dead
at
28
--
is
in
novelized
form
but
does
not
abuse
its
tragic
subject
.

or
pushing

Clerfayt
of
Heaven
Has
No
Favorites
resembles
Portago
only
in
that
he
is
male
and
a
race-driver
--
quite
a
bad
race-driver
,
whereas
Portago
was
a
good
one
.

He
is
a
dull
,
unformed
,
and
aimless
person
;
;

He
proposed
throwing
together
a
man
in
an
occupation
of
high
hazard
and
a
woman
balanced
on
a
knife-edge
between
death
from
tuberculosis
and
recovery
.

His
treatment
of
it
is
something
else
.

The
jacket
biography
describes
him
as
a
former
racing
driver
,
and
he
may
indeed
have
been
,
although
I
do
not
recall
having
encountered
his
name
either
in
the
records
or
the
literature
.

The
necessity
is
not
clear
to
me
,
and
,
in
any
case
,
to
present
a
case-hardened
race-driver
as
saying
he
has
left
his
car
,
which
,
or
whom
,
he
calls
Giuseppe
,
parked
on
the
Place
Vendome
sneering
at
a
dozen
Bentleys
and
Rolls-Royces
parked
around
him
is
not
a
liberty
;
;

Clerfayt
is
neurotic
,
preoccupied
,
and
passive
.

Errors
in
technical
terminology
suggest
that
the
over-all
translation
from
the
German
may
not
convey
quite
everything
Mr.
Remarque
hoped
to
tell
us
.

However
,
my
principal
objection
in
this
sort
of
novel
is
to
the
hackneyed
treatment
of
race-drivers
,
pilots
,
submariners
,
atomic
researchers
,
and
all
the
machine-masters
of
our
age
as
brooding
mystics
or
hysterical
fatalists
.

The
west
is
leaderless
,
according
to
this
book
.

With
this
barrage
,
Montgomery
of
Alamein
launches
his
attack
upon
the
blunderings
of
the
West
.

America
has
divided
more
than
she
has
united
the
West
.

The
net
result
is
that
under
American
leadership
the
general
world
situation
has
become
bad
.

Major
to
this
effort
is
to
get
all
world
powers
to
withdraw
to
their
own
territories
,
say
by
1970
.

In
looking
as
far
back
as
Moses
,
thence
to
Cromwell
,
Napoleon
,
Lincoln
,
Churchill
,
and
Nehru
,
Montgomery
attempts
to
trace
the
stirrings
and
qualities
of
great
men
.

Monty
shows
a
remarkable
capacity
for
the
direct
statement
and
an
equally
remarkable
incapacity
for
giving
adequate
support
.

For
the
most
part
,
his
writing
rambles
and
jogs
,
preventing
easy
access
by
the
reader
to
his
true
thoughts
.

And
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
the
new
frontier
now
taking
form
can
produce
the
leadership
and
wisdom
necessary
to
understand
the
current
shape
of
events
.

It
is
no
common
thing
for
a
listener
(
critical
or
otherwise
)
to
hear
a
singer
live
for
the
first
time
only
after
he
has
died
.

To
be
sure
,
Lanza
made
numerous
concert
tours
,
here
and
abroad
,
but
these
did
not
take
him
to
New
York
where
the
carping
critic
might
lurk
.

The
reading
public
,
the
theatergoing
public
,
the
skindiving
public
,
the
horse-playing
public
--
all
these
and
others
fill
substantial
roles
in
U.S.
life
,
but
none
is
so
varied
,
vast
and
vigilant
as
the
eating
public
.

Through
previous
centuries
,
eating
changed
by
nearly
imperceptible
degrees
,
and
mostly
toward
just
getting
enough
.

Refrigeration
,
automated
processing
and
packaging
conspire
to
defy
season
and
banish
spoilage
.

And
in
the
wake
of
the
new
affluence
and
the
new
techniques
of
processing
comes
a
new
American
interest
in
how
what
people
eat
affects
their
health
.

Out
of
cholesterol
come
Keys's
main
messages
so
far
:

The
typical
U.S.
daily
menu
,
says
Dr.
Keys
,
contains
3,000
calories
,
should
contain
2,300
.

Americans
eat
too
much
fat
.

With
meat
,
milk
,
butter
and
ice
cream
,
the
calorie-heavy
U.S.
diet
is
40%
fat
,
and
most
of
that
is
saturated
fat
--
the
insidious
kind
,
says
Dr.
Keys
,
that
increases
blood
cholesterol
,
damages
arteries
,
and
leads
to
coronary
disease
.

In
West
Africa
,
for
example
,
where
meat
is
a
luxury
and
babies
must
be
weaned
early
to
make
room
at
the
breast
for
later
arrivals
,
a
childhood
menace
is
kwashiorkor
,
or
Red
Johnny
,
a
growth-stunting
protein
deficiency
(
signs
:
reddish
hair
,
bloated
belly
)
that
kills
more
than
half
its
victims
,
leaves
the
rest
prey
for
parasites
and
lingering
tropical
disease
.

Morals
aside
,
the
fat
man
has
plenty
to
worry
about
--
over
and
above
the
fact
that
no
one
any
longer
loves
him
.

The
simple
mechanical
strain
of
overweight
,
says
New
York's
Dr.
Norman
Jolliffe
,
can
overburden
and
damage
the
heart
for
much
the
same
reason
that
a
Chevrolet
engine
in
a
Cadillac
body
would
wear
out
sooner
than
if
it
were
in
a
body
for
which
it
was
built
.

He
has
--
for
unclear
reasons
--
a
25%
higher
death
rate
from
cancer
.

Physical
exercise
raises
the
appestat
.

The
result
says
Jolliffe
:
The
child
gains
the
feeling
that
food
is
the
purpose
of
life
.

He
may
be
interested
in
another
woman
,
or
just
like
being
with
the
boys
.

For
the
army
of
compulsive
eaters
--
from
the
nibblers
and
the
gobblers
to
the
downright
gluttons
--
reducing
is
a
war
with
the
will
that
is
rarely
won
.

Metrecal
is
a
pretty
complete
food
,
he
says
.

What
concerns
him
much
more
is
the
relationship
of
diet
to
the
nation's
No.
1
killer
:
coronary
artery
disease
,
which
accounts
for
more
than
half
of
all
heart
fatalities
and
kills
500,000
Americans
a
year
--
twice
the
toll
from
all
varieties
of
cancer
,
five
times
the
deaths
from
automobile
accidents
.

They
suspect
it
plays
a
role
in
the
production
of
adrenal
hormones
,
and
they
believe
it
is
essential
to
the
transport
of
fats
throughout
the
circulatory
system
.

Although
the
fatty
protein
molecules
,
carried
in
the
blood
and
partly
composed
of
cholesterol
,
are
water
soluble
,
cholesterol
itself
is
insoluble
,
and
cannot
be
destroyed
by
the
body
.

Or
(
more
commonly
,
thinks
Keys
)
the
deposits
themselves
get
so
big
that
they
choke
off
the
artery's
flow
to
the
point
that
an
infarct
occurs
:
the
heart
muscle
is
suffocated
,
cells
supplied
by
the
artery
die
,
and
the
heart
is
permanently
,
perhaps
fatally
injured
.

During
World
War
2
,
,
doctors
in
The
Netherlands
and
Scandinavia
noted
a
curious
fact
:
despite
the
stresses
of
Nazi
occupation
,
the
death
rate
from
coronary
artery
disease
was
slowly
dropping
.

That
same
year
the
University
of
California's
Dr.
Laurance
Kinsell
,
timing
oxidation
rates
of
blood
fats
,
stumbled
onto
the
discovery
that
many
vegetable
fats
cause
blood
cholesterol
levels
to
drop
radically
,
while
animal
fats
cause
them
to
rise
.

All
natural
food
fats
fall
into
one
of
three
categories
--
saturated
,
mono-unsaturated
and
poly-unsaturated
.

The
degree
of
saturation
depends
on
the
number
of
hydrogen
atoms
on
the
fat
molecule
.

As
a
result
,
although
we
still
make
use
of
this
distinction
,
there
is
much
confusion
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
basic
terms
employed
.

We
are
in
a
transitional
stage
in
which
many
of
the
connotations
of
former
usage
have
had
to
be
revised
or
rejected
.

Not
only
in
popular
thought
but
in
that
of
the
highly
educated
as
well
was
this
true
.

All
this
has
not
,
however
,
been
an
unmixed
blessing
.

The
scientific
debunking
of
the
spirit
world
has
been
in
a
way
too
successful
and
too
thorough
.

Science
has
simply
left
us
helpless
and
powerless
in
this
important
sector
of
our
lives
.

Everyone
in
Salem
,
saint
and
sinner
alike
,
is
swept
up
by
it
.

The
audience
leaves
the
play
under
a
spell
,
It
is
the
kind
of
spell
which
the
exposure
to
spirit
in
its
living
active
manifestation
always
evokes
.

I
hear
the
boot
of
Lucifer
,
I
see
his
filthy
face
!
!

Yet
are
not
we
of
the
mid-twentieth
century
,
who
rightly
do
not
believe
there
is
any
such
thing
as
the
devil
,
just
as
bad
off
as
they
--
only
in
a
different
way
?
?

We
are
left
helpless
to
cope
with
it
because
we
do
not
dare
speak
of
it
as
anything
real
for
fear
that
to
do
so
would
imply
a
commitment
to
that
which
has
already
been
discredited
and
proved
false
.

In
a
long
commentary
which
he
has
inserted
in
the
published
text
of
the
first
act
of
the
play
,
he
says
at
one
point
:
However
,
that
experience
never
raised
a
doubt
in
his
mind
as
to
the
reality
of
the
underworld
or
the
existence
of
Lucifer's
many-faced
lieutenants
.

Better
minds
than
Hale's
were
--
and
still
are
--
convinced
that
there
is
a
society
of
spirits
beyond
our
ken
.

Yet
such
is
the
dramatic
power
of
his
writing
that
the
audience
is
nevertheless
left
in
the
grip
of
the
terrible
power
and
potency
of
that
which
came
over
Salem
.

It
casts
a
spell
upon
them
so
that
they
leave
with
a
feeling
of
having
been
in
the
mysterious
presence
of
an
evil
power
.

We
cannot
,
of
course
,
assign
it
any
substance
.

For
it
is
primarily
in
community
that
we
know
and
experience
spirit
.

When
we
say
that
a
mythological
mode
of
thought
must
be
completely
abandoned
,
we
mean
it
must
be
abandoned
as
the
sole
or
proper
means
for
presenting
the
Christian
understanding
of
existence
.

If
Bultmann's
own
definition
of
myth
is
strictly
adhered
to
(
and
it
is
interesting
that
this
is
almost
never
done
by
those
who
make
such
pronouncements
)
,
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
he
does
not
at
all
exaggerate
the
extent
to
which
the
mythological
concepts
of
traditional
theology
have
become
incredible
and
irrelevant
.

On
the
contrary
,
even
in
the
heart
of
the
Bible
belt
itself
,
as
can
be
attested
by
any
one
who
is
called
to
work
there
,
the
industrial
and
technological
revolutions
have
long
been
under
way
,
together
with
the
corresponding
changes
in
man's
picture
of
himself
and
his
world
.

To
be
sure
,
when
this
is
pointed
out
,
a
common
response
among
certain
churchmen
is
to
fulminate
about
the
little
flock
and
the
great
crowd
and
to
take
solace
from
Paul's
castigation
of
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
in
the
opening
chapter
of
First
Corinthians
.

There
is
an
ancient
and
venerable
tradition
in
the
church
(
which
derives
,
however
,
from
the
heritage
of
the
Greeks
rather
than
from
the
Bible
)
that
God
is
completely
independent
of
his
creation
and
so
has
no
need
of
men
for
accomplishing
his
work
in
the
world
.

By
analogy
,
the
church
also
has
been
regarded
as
entirely
independent
of
the
world
in
the
sense
of
requiring
nothing
from
it
in
order
to
be
the
church
.

Until
we
translate
this
gospel
into
a
language
that
enlightened
men
today
can
understand
,
we
are
depriving
ourselves
of
the
very
resources
on
which
the
continued
success
of
our
witness
most
certainly
depends
.

But
the
main
point
here
is
that
even
if
such
a
restatement
were
not
possible
,
the
demand
to
demythologize
the
kerygma
would
still
be
unavoidable
.

This
is
what
we
mean
when
we
say
this
demand
must
be
accepted
without
condition
.

Expressed
differently
:
if
the
price
for
becoming
a
faithful
follower
of
Jesus
Christ
is
some
form
of
self-destruction
,
whether
of
the
body
or
of
the
mind
--
sacrificium
corporis
,
sacrificium
intellectus
--
then
there
is
no
alternative
but
that
the
price
remain
unpaid
.

It
is
to
this
same
tradition
that
most
of
the
creative
figures
in
the
last
century
and
a
half
of
American
theology
also
belong
.

Although
they
have
also
been
concerned
to
stand
squarely
within
the
tradition
of
the
apostolic
church
,
they
have
exhibited
no
willingness
whatever
to
sacrifice
their
modernity
to
their
Christianity
.

They
have
insisted
,
rather
,
on
living
fully
and
completely
within
modern
culture
and
,
so
far
from
considering
this
treason
to
God
,
have
looked
upon
it
as
the
only
way
they
could
be
faithful
to
him
.

However
much
we
may
have
to
criticize
liberal
theology's
constructive
formulations
,
the
theology
we
ourselves
must
strive
to
formulate
can
only
go
beyond
liberalism
,
not
behind
it
.

To
do
this
,
it
is
sufficient
to
point
out
that
if
the
principle
in
terms
of
which
alternatives
are
to
be
conceived
is
such
as
to
exclude
more
than
two
,
then
the
question
of
a
third
possibility
is
a
meaningless
question
.

for
,
in
either
event
,
the
first
possibility
is
excluded
.

One
hundred
years
ago
there
existed
in
England
the
Association
for
the
Promotion
of
the
Unity
of
Christendom
.

The
Church
Unity
Octave
,
January
18-25
,
was
enthusiastically
devoted
to
prayer
and
discussion
by
the
various
churches
.

But
it
must
be
readily
seen
that
the
religious
picture
in
England
has
so
greatly
changed
during
these
hundred
years
as
to
engender
hope
,
at
least
on
the
Catholic
side
.

I
came
to
England
last
summer
to
do
research
on
the
unpublished
letters
of
Cardinal
Newman
.

being
intellectually
influenced
by
Newman
and
the
general
19th-century
literature
of
England
,
I
knew
only
a
Protestant-dominated
country
.

On
my
first
Guy
Fawkes
Day
here
,
I
found
Catholics
as
well
as
non-Catholics
celebrating
with
the
traditional
fireworks
and
bonfires
,
and
was
told
that
most
Englishmen
either
do
not
know
or
are
not
concerned
with
the
historical
significance
of
the
day
.

When
you
pile
your
guy
on
the
bonfire
tomorrow
night
,
I
wonder
how
much
of
the
true
story
of
Guy
Fawkes
you
will
remember
?
?

The
article
proceeded
to
give
an
inaccurate
account
of
a
Catholic
plot
to
kill
King
James
1
.

yet
it
represents
a
very
considerable
percentage
of
the
churchgoing
population
.

An
amazing
article
in
the
Manchester
Guardian
of
last
November
,
entitled
Fate
Of
Redundant
Churches
,
states
than
an
Archbishops'
Commission
reported
last
month
that
in
the
Church
of
England
alone
there
are
790
churches
which
are
redundant
now
,
or
will
be
in
20
years'
time
.

Most
of
these
former
churches
are
now
used
as
warehouses
,
but
neither
Anglicans
nor
Nonconformists
object
to
selling
churches
to
Roman
Catholics
,
and
have
done
so
.

That
day
is
perhaps
today
,
1961
,
and
it
seems
no
longer
very
meaningful
to
call
England
a
Protestant
country
.

One
of
the
ironies
of
the
present
crusade
for
Christian
unity
is
that
there
are
not
,
relatively
speaking
,
many
real
Christians
to
unite
.

I
have
found
myself
saying
with
other
foreigners
here
that
English
Catholics
are
good
Catholics
.

It
has
been
my
experience
to
find
as
many
men
as
women
in
church
,
and
to
hear
almost
everyone
in
church
congregations
reciting
the
Latin
prayers
and
responses
at
Mass
.

They
hope
,
of
course
,
to
reclaim
the
non-Catholic
population
to
the
Catholic
faith
,
and
at
every
Sunday
Benediction
they
recite
by
heart
the
Prayer
for
England
:

English
Catholics
reacted
to
this
event
with
moderate
but
real
hope
.

a
report
that
200
Protestant
clergymen
and
laity
attended
a
votive
Mass
offered
for
Christian
unity
at
a
Catholic
church
in
Slough
during
the
Church
Unity
Octave
.

The
straight
line
would
symbolize
its
uniqueness
,
the
circle
its
universality
.

yet
each
historical
event
remains
unique
.

As
Origen
interprets
the
end
of
history
on
the
basis
of
its
beginning
,
so
Irenaeus
portrays
the
story
of
Adam
on
the
basis
of
the
story
of
Christ
.

Whence
,
then
,
comes
the
substance
of
the
first
man
?
?

From
this
earth
,
then
,
while
it
was
still
virgin
God
took
dust
and
fashioned
the
man
,
the
beginning
of
humanity
.

Adam
and
Eve
were
perfect
,
not
in
the
sense
that
they
possessed
perfection
,
but
in
the
sense
that
they
were
capable
of
development
toward
perfection
.

Irenaeus
does
not
claim
pre-existence
for
the
human
soul
;
;

Historical
existence
is
a
created
good
.

in
the
similitude
of
God
he
created
him
.

And
He
laid
down
for
him
certain
conditions
:
so
that
,
if
he
kept
the
command
of
God
,
then
he
would
always
remain
as
he
was
,
that
is
,
immortal
;
;

He
was
,
in
the
words
of
Irenaeus
,
beguiled
by
another
under
the
pretext
of
immortality
.

Eve
was
disobedient
;
;

And
even
as
she
,
having
indeed
a
husband
,
Adam
,
but
being
nevertheless
as
yet
a
virgin
,
having
become
disobedient
,
was
made
the
cause
of
death
,
both
to
herself
and
to
the
entire
human
race
;
;

At
the
nadir
of
that
circuit
is
death
.

Along
with
the
fruit
they
did
also
fall
under
the
power
of
death
,
because
they
did
eat
in
disobedience
;
;

The
wages
of
sin
is
death
.

Nevertheless
,
even
at
the
nadir
of
the
circuit
the
spiral
of
history
belongs
to
God
,
and
he
still
rules
.

Even
death
,
therefore
,
has
a
providential
as
well
as
a
punitive
function
.

As
man
can
live
only
by
dying
,
so
it
was
only
by
his
dying
that
Christ
could
bring
many
to
life
.

It
represents
a
punishment
that
he
knows
he
deserves
,
but
it
also
symbolizes
most
dramatically
that
he
lives
his
life
within
the
process
of
time
.

It
is
the
wages
of
sin
,
and
its
sting
is
the
law
.

If
this
aspect
of
death
as
punishment
is
not
distinguished
from
the
idea
of
death
as
natural
termination
,
the
conclusion
seems
inevitable
that
temporal
existence
itself
is
a
form
of
punishment
rather
than
the
state
into
which
man
is
put
by
the
will
of
the
Creator
.

for
it
teaches
salvation
from
,
not
salvation
in
,
time
and
history
.

the
difference
between
Mr.
Parker
and
the
Association
is
a
difference
between
no
Christianity
and
Christianity
--
despite
these
supposed
conclusive
assurances
,
the
modern
liberal
heaves
repeatedly
a
sigh
of
relief
,
of
positive
thanksgiving
,
that
the
Association
never
quite
brought
itself
officially
to
expel
Parker
.

Had
it
done
so
,
the
blot
on
its
escutcheon
would
have
remained
indelible
,
nor
could
the
Harvard
Divinity
School
assemble
today
to
honor
Parker's
insurgence
other
than
by
getting
down
on
its
collective
knees
and
crying
peccavi
.

In
the
hall
,
after
adjournment
,
Dr.
Frothingham
took
him
warmly
by
the
hand
and
requested
Parker
to
visit
him
--
whereupon
our
burly
Theodore
again
burst
into
tears
.

It
cannot
be
smoothed
over
by
now
cherishing
his
sarcasms
as
delightful
bits
of
self-deprecation
or
by
solemnly
calling
for
a
reconsideration
of
the
justice
of
the
objections
to
him
.

The
gentle
Channing
,
revered
by
all
Bostonians
,
orthodox
or
Unitarian
,
wrote
to
a
friend
in
Louisville
that
among
its
many
virtues
Boston
did
not
abound
in
a
tolerant
spirit
,
that
the
yoke
of
opinion
crushed
individuality
of
judgment
and
action
:
No
city
in
the
world
is
governed
so
little
by
a
police
,
and
so
much
by
mutual
inspections
and
what
is
called
public
sentiment
.

What
otherwise
could
the
lawyer
,
doctor
,
minister
,
the
men
of
science
and
letters
do
when
told
that
they
had
become
the
cherubim
and
seraphim
and
the
three
archangels
who
stood
before
the
golden
throne
of
the
merchant
,
and
continually
cried
,
'
Holy
,
holy
,
holy
is
the
Almighty
Dollar
'
?
?

There
are
a
great
many
bishops
who
have
never
had
a
cross
on
their
bosom
,
nor
a
mitre
on
their
head
,
who
appeal
not
to
the
authority
of
the
Pope
at
Rome
,
but
to
the
Almighty
Dollar
,
a
pope
much
nearer
home
.

Because
he
copiously
shed
his
own
tears
,
and
yielded
himself
up
as
a
living
sacrifice
to
the
impersonalized
conscience
of
New
England
,
he
was
not
disturbed
by
the
havoc
he
worked
in
other
people's
consciences
.

We
have
not
the
leisure
,
or
the
patience
,
or
the
skill
,
to
comprehend
what
was
working
in
the
mind
and
heart
of
a
then
recent
graduate
from
the
Harvard
Divinity
School
who
would
muster
the
audacity
to
contradict
his
most
formidable
instructor
,
the
majesterial
Andrews
Norton
,
by
saying
that
,
while
he
believed
Jesus
like
other
religious
teachers
,
worked
miracles
,
I
see
not
how
a
miracle
proves
a
doctrine
.

Doubts
thus
inculcated
left
me
floundering
for
a
while
and
,
like
some
higher
critical
friends
,
trying
to
continue
to
use
the
Bible
as
the
Word
of
God
while
at
the
same
time
holding
it
to
have
been
subjected
to
a
vast
number
of
redactions
and
interpolations
:
attempting
to
bridge
the
chasm
between
an
older
,
reverent
,
Bible-loving
generation
and
a
critical
,
doubting
,
Bible-emancipated
race
.

Now
,
if
any
part
of
the
Bible
is
assuredly
the
very
Word
of
God
speaking
through
His
servant
,
it
is
John's
Gospel
.

Here
I
took
my
leave
of
my
learned
friends
to
step
out
on
another
path
,
to
which
we
might
give
the
modern
name
of
Pragmatism
,
or
the
thing
that
works
.

So
,
I
put
my
Bible
to
the
practical
test
of
noting
what
it
says
about
itself
,
and
then
tested
it
to
see
how
it
worked
.

The
next
traditional
step
then
was
to
accept
it
as
the
authoritative
textbook
of
the
Christian
faith
just
as
one
would
accept
a
treatise
on
any
earthly
science
,
and
I
submitted
to
its
conditions
according
to
Christ's
invitation
and
promise
that
,
If
any
man
will
do
his
will
,
he
shall
know
of
the
doctrine
,
whether
it
be
of
God
,
or
whether
I
speak
of
myself
(
John
7
:
17
)
.

The
outcome
of
such
an
experiment
has
been
in
due
time
the
acceptance
of
the
Bible
as
the
Word
of
God
inspired
in
a
sense
utterly
different
from
any
merely
human
book
,
and
with
it
the
acceptance
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
as
the
only
begotten
Son
of
God
,
Son
of
Man
by
the
Virgin
Mary
,
the
Saviour
of
the
world
.

The
Bible
is
as
obviously
and
truly
food
for
the
spirit
as
bread
is
food
for
the
body
.

I
place
His
precepts
and
His
leadings
above
every
seeming
probability
,
dismissing
cherished
convictions
and
holding
the
wisdom
of
man
as
folly
when
opposed
to
Him
.

Let
not
your
heart
be
troubled
,
neither
let
it
be
afraid
.

What
a
joy
to
realize
that
we
,
too
,
can
claim
this
promise
tendered
by
the
Lord
during
His
earthly
ministry
to
a
group
of
men
who
were
very
dear
to
Him
.

Before
He
left
them
He
promised
that
His
peace
would
be
their
portion
to
abide
in
their
hearts
and
minds
.

You
may
know
that
you
are
in
God's
family
and
be
just
as
sure
of
it
as
you
are
that
you
belong
to
the
family
of
your
earthly
father
.

on

to

to

?

Your
spiritual
inner
space
helps
determine
the
spirituality
of
America
as
a
nation
.

We
trust
you
are
not
one
of
the
70,000,000
Americans
who
do
not
attend
church
,
but
who
feel
that
various
forms
of
recreation
are
more
important
than
worshipping
the
God
who
made
our
country
great
.

Is
forgiveness
of
past
sins
,
assurance
of
present
help
,
and
hope
of
future
bliss
in
your
orbit
?
?

That
is
why
the
Bible
commands
you
to
Taste
and
see
that
the
Lord
is
good
:
blessed
(
happy
)
is
the
man
that
trusteth
in
Him
(
Psalm
34
:
8
)
.

As
many
as
received
Him
(
Jesus
)
,
to
them
gave
He
power
to
become
the
sons
of
God
,
even
to
them
that
believe
on
his
name
.

The
Lord
is
my
light
and
my
salvation
;
;

A
certain
teacher
scheduled
a
Fear
Party
for
her
fourth
grade
pupils
.

He
says
:
That
would
reduce
neurotic
ailments
tremendously
.

One
of
the
most
wholesome
things
you
could
schedule
in
your
church
would
thus
be
a
group
confessional
where
people
could
admit
of
their
inner
tensions
.

12%
of
them
worried
about
their
health
,
although
their
ailments
were
imaginary
;
;

10%
of
them
worried
about
their
friends
,
neighbors
,
and
relatives
,
most
of
whom
were
quite
capable
of
taking
care
of
themselves
.

In
one
of
his
writings
Pascal
speaks
of
this
mania
for
diversion
as
being
a
sign
of
misery
and
fear
which
man
cannot
endure
without
such
opiates
.

Does
that
explain
why
there
is
now
such
a
big
boom
in
the
bomb
shelter
business
?
?

Suppose
we
do
get
our
fears
out
in
the
open
,
what
then
?
?

Meanwhile
,
the
enemy
will
capitalize
on
our
fears
,
if
he
can
.

whom
shall
I
fear
?
?

Well
,
you
say
,
those
are
beautiful
words
all
right
,
but
it
was
easy
for
the
psalmist
to
sing
them
in
his
day
.

He
didn't
live
in
a
world
of
perpetual
peril
like
ours
.

Though
an
host
should
encamp
against
me
,
my
heart
shall
not
fear
:
though
war
should
rise
against
me
,
in
this
will
I
be
confident
.

That
is
almost
a
perfect
description
of
the
predicament
in
which
we
find
ourselves
today
,
isn't
it
?
?

The
entrance
to
a
church
has
been
walled
up
,
so
that
the
congregation
,
most
of
which
is
in
the
western
sector
,
cannot
worship
God
there
anymore
.

And
nobody
knows
what
comes
next
.

of
whom
shall
I
be
afraid
?
?

First
,
the
Lord
is
my
light
.

For
those
who
put
their
trust
in
Him
He
still
says
every
day
again
:
Let
there
be
light
!
!

We
live
in
the
bright
daylight
of
that
great
event
;
;

And
God
had
conquered
that
one
by
His
grace
!
!

If
God
be
for
us
,
who
can
be
against
us
?
?

(
Romans
31
,
32
,
35
)

Thus
,
while
it
remains
possible
that
the
Babylonians
the
Pythagoreans
may
perhaps
have
had
the
magic
square
of
three
before
the
Chinese
did
,
more
definite
evidence
will
have
to
turn
up
from
the
Middle
East
or
the
Classical
World
before
China
can
lose
her
claim
to
the
earliest
known
magic
square
by
more
than
a
thousand
years
.

However
,
the
wei
books
were
also
destroyed
in
a
series
of
Orthodox
Confucian
purges
which
culminated
in
a
final
proscription
in
605
.

After
all
this
destruction
of
old
literature
,
it
should
be
obvious
why
we
have
so
little
information
about
the
early
history
and
development
of
the
Lo
Shu
,
which
was
already
semisecret
anyhow
.

The
importance
of
this
5
can
largely
be
explained
by
the
natural
mathematical
properties
of
the
middle
number
and
its
special
relationship
to
all
the
rest
of
the
numbers
--
quite
apart
from
any
numerological
considerations
,
which
is
to
say
,
any
symbolic
meaning
arbitrarily
assigned
to
it
.

If
one
takes
the
middle
number
,
5
,
and
multiplies
it
by
3
(
the
base
number
of
the
magic
square
of
three
)
,
the
result
is
15
,
which
is
also
the
constant
sum
of
all
the
rows
,
columns
,
and
two
main
diagonals
.

Furthermore
,
the
middle
number
of
the
Lo
Shu
is
not
only
the
physical
mean
between
every
opposing
pair
of
the
other
numbers
,
by
reason
of
its
central
position
;
;

His
immediate
motive
for
doing
this
may
not
have
been
directly
inspired
by
the
Lo
Shu
,
but
this
measure
must
inevitably
have
increased
the
existing
beliefs
in
the
latter's
efficacy
.

And
why
did
the
Chinese
suddenly
begin
to
talk
about
the
Five
Directions
,
when
the
animals
they
used
as
symbols
of
the
directions
designated
only
the
usual
four
?
?

For
the
Lo
Shu
square
was
a
remarkably
complete
compendium
of
most
of
the
chief
religious
and
philosophical
ideas
of
its
time
.

We
have
already
seen
that
odd
numbers
were
considered
as
being
Yang
,
while
the
even
numbers
were
Yin
,
so
that
the
eight
outer
numbers
of
the
Lo
Shu
represented
these
two
principles
in
balanced
equilibrium
around
the
axial
center
.

taking
the
former
from
the
Five
Sacred
Mountains
of
the
Han
period
and
the
latter
from

river

China

It
can

4,499,608
members
and
twenty
years
later
its
membership
stood
at
4,622,444
.

During
this
time
4,122,354
new
members
were
brought
into
the
fellowship
.

During
this
period
7,484,268
members
were
received
,
yet
the
net
membership
now
is
only
9,910,741
.

The
local
family
of
God
has
failed
its
new
members
through
neglect
and
unconcern
for
their
spiritual
welfare
.

When
they
unite
with
the
Church
they
must
find
in
this
fellowship
the
satisfaction
of
their
basic
spiritual
needs
or
they
will
never
mature
into
effective
Christians
.

--
Welcome
into
the
fellowship

Man
is
at
once
a
gregarious
animal
and
a
form-creating
being
.

Interfaith
communication
need
not
be
regarded
as
an
unfortunate
burden
visited
upon
us
by
the
necessity
of
maintaining
diplomatic
relations
with
our
adversaries
.

Interfaith
conflicts
which
spring
from
psychological
deficiencies
are
the
most
unfortunate
of
all
,
for
they
have
no
redeeming
features
whatsoever
.

As
an
obvious
consequence
,
obstacles
to
genuine
interfaith
communication
have
grown
more
formidable
in
one
important
area
:
relations
between
Christians
and
non-Christians
in
these
lands
.

Insofar
as
these
nations
claim
to
incarnate
traditions
and
ways
of
life
which
constitute
ultimate
,
trans-political
justifications
for
their
existence
,
such
people
are
inevitably
led
to
emphasize
the
ways
in
which
these
traditions
and
ways
are
theirs
rather
than
someone
else's
.

In
1960
Ceylon
nationalized
its
sectarian
--
preponderantly
Christian
--
schools
,
to
the
rejoicing
of
most
of
its
7,000,000
Buddhists
and
the
lament
of
its
800,000
Roman
Catholics
.

It
was
not
that
they
had
been
contracted
for
during
the
interval
;
;

It
is
not
unfair
to
add
on
the
other
side
that
the
crude
and
almost
vitriolic
approach
of
certain
fundamentalist
sects
toward
the
cultures
and
religions
among
which
they
work
has
contributed
measurably
to
this
heightening
of
anti-Christian
sentiment
.

The
American
Constitution
was
historic
at
this
point
in
providing
that
Congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
.

My
father
went
as
a
missionary
to
China
in
a
generation
that
responded
to
Student
Volunteer
Movement
speakers
who
held
watches
in
their
hands
and
announced
to
the
students
in
their
audiences
how
many
Chinese
souls
were
going
to
hell
each
second
because
these
students
were
not
over
there
saving
them
.

I
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
Christians
have
adopted
the
liberal
assumption
,
so
prevalent
in
Hinduism
,
that
all
religions
are
merely
different
paths
to
the
same
summit
.

Leslie
Newbiggin
reflects
the
dominant
position
within
the
World
Council
of
Churches
when
he
says
,
We
must
claim
absoluteness
and
finality
for
Christ
and
His
finished
work
,
but
that
very
claim
forbids
us
to
claim
absoluteness
and
finality
for
our
understanding
of
it
.

The
Roman
Catholic
Church
has
excommunicated
one
of
its
priests
,
Father
Feeney
,
for
insisting
that
there
is
no
salvation
outside
the
visible
church
.

When
they
say
that
under
no
circumstances
would
it
ever
be
right
to
permit
the
termination
of
the
human
race
by
human
action
,
because
there
could
not
possibly
be
any
proportionate
grave
reason
to
justify
such
a
thing
,
they
know
exactly
what
they
mean
.

Of
course
,
in
prudential
calculation
,
in
balancing
the
good
directly
intended
and
done
against
the
evil
unintended
and
indirectly
done
,
no
greater
precision
can
be
forthcoming
than
the
subject
allows
.

I
mean
,
however
,
that
the
moral
theologian
knows
what
he
means
by
permit
.

He
is
talking
about
an
action
which
just
as
efficaciously
does
an
evil
thing
(
and
is
known
certainly
and
unavoidably
to
lead
to
this
evil
result
)
as
it
efficaciously
does
some
good
.

Naturally
,
where
one
or
the
other
of
the
effects
of
an
action
is
uncertain
,
this
has
to
be
taken
into
account
.

Especially
is
this
true
when
,
because
the
good
effect
is
remote
and
speculative
while
the
evil
is
certain
and
grave
,
the
action
is
prohibited
.

If
an
evil
which
is
certain
and
extensive
and
immediate
may
rarely
be
compensated
for
by
a
problematic
,
speculative
,
future
good
,
by
the
same
token
not
every
present
,
certain
,
and
immediate
good
(
or
lesser
evil
)
that
may
have
to
be
done
will
be
outweighed
by
a
problematic
,
speculative
,
and
future
evil
.

If
it
continues
indefinitely
it
is
nearly
a
statistical
certainty
that
a
mistake
will
be
made
and
that
the
devastation
will
begin
.

Against
such
a
termination
of
human
life
on
earth
by
human
action
,
he
then
proposes
as
an
alternative
that
we
negotiate
at
once
with
the
Russians
and
get
the
best
terms
which
are
available
,
that
we
deliberately
negotiate
from
comparative
weakness
.

He
bravely
attempts
to
face
this
alternative
realistically
,
i.e.
,
by
considering
the
worst
possible
outcome
,
namely
,
the
total
domination
of
the
world
by
Russia
within
a
few
years
.

This
would
be
by
far
the
better
choice
,
when
it
is
a
question
of
allowing
the
human
race
to
survive
,
possibly
under
the
domination
of
a
regime
which
most
of
us
detest
,
or
of
allowing
it
to
destroy
itself
in
appalling
and
prolonged
anguish
.

I
do
not
accept
that
the
choice
is
between
capitulation
and
the
certainty
of
nuclear
war
.

Let
us
therefore
put
first
things
first
,
and
make
sure
of
preserving
the
human
race
at
whatever
the
temporary
price
may
be
.

He
wants
to
be
brutally
frank
and
say
that
these
rebellions
would
be
hopeless
--
far
,
far
more
hopeless
than
was
the
Hungarian
revolution
of
1956
.

It
is
a
proposal
that
justice
now
be
served
by
means
other
than
those
that
have
ever
preconditioned
the
search
for
it
,
or
preconditioned
more
positive
means
for
attaining
it
,
in
the
past
.

This
is
to
surrender
in
advance
to
whatever
attack
may
yet
be
mounted
,
to
the
very
last
;
;

and
,
now
and
in
the
future
unlike
in
the
past
,
any
attempt
to
repel
injury
and
to
preserve
any
particular
civilized
attainment
of
mankind
or
its
provisional
justice
runs
some
risk
of
nuclear
warfare
and
the
danger
that
an
effect
of
it
will
,
by
human
action
,
render
this
planet
less
habitable
by
the
human
race
.

Much
more
than
shelter
,
housing
symbolizes
social
status
,
a
sense
of
belonging
,
acceptance
within
a
given
group
or
neighborhood
,
identification
with
particular
cultural
values
and
social
institutions
,
feelings
of
pride
and
worth
,
aspirations
and
hopes
basic
to
human
well-being
.

What
does
he
conceive
his
role
to
be
in
this
area
of
social
unrest
?
?

What
social
,
ethical
and
theological
insights
can
the
church
and
university
help
him
bring
to
bear
upon
his
situation
?
?

Recently
,
a
group
of
the
faculty
at
Wesleyan
University's
Public
Affairs
Center
sought
some
answers
to
these
questions
.

For
a
number
of
years
,
Wesleyan
has
been
drawing
varied
groups
of
political
and
business
leaders
into
these
informal
discussions
with
members
of
the
faculty
and
student
body
,
attempting
to
explore
and
clarify
aspects
of
their
responsibility
for
public
policy
.

Obviously
,
much
more
than
customer
expectation
is
determining
the
realtor's
role
.

Judgments
are
continually
rendered
regarding
the
potential
buyers'
income
,
educational
level
and
above
all
,
racial
extraction
;
;

all
feared
the
supposed
stigma
they
believed
would
inevitably
attach
to
any
realtor
who
openly
introduced
non-white
,
particularly
Negro
,
peoples
into
all-white
,
restricted
areas
.

From
such
communal
roles
the
realtor
finds
the
substance
that
shapes
his
moral
understanding
.

anti-discriminatory
statutes
in
housing
have
now
been
adopted
by
thirteen
states
and
,
while
specific
provisions
have
varied
,
the
tendency
is
clearly
toward
expanding
coverage
.

As
far
as
they
were
aware
,
the
Connecticut
Association
of
Real
Estate
Boards
had
not
officially
opposed
the
bill's
passage
or
lobbied
in
its
support
.

Official
reasoning
:
the
bill
was
a
wanton
invasion
of
basic
property
rights
.

Judicial
opinion
since
the
Supreme
Court
decision
on
Shelley
v.
Kraemer
(
1948
)
has
rendered
racial
restrictive
covenants
unenforcible
.

In
the
states
that
have
passed
laws
preventing
discrimination
in
the
sale
or
rental
of
housing
,
support
by
real
estate
associations
for
compliance
and
broadened
coverage
through
additional
legislation
could
help
remove
the
label
of
social
reformism
that
most
realtors
individually
seem
determined
to
avoid
.

But
responsiveness
to
these
opportunities
presumes
that
all
of
us
judge
the
good
as
a
human
good
and
not
simply
as
a
professional
,
white
,
American
good
.

That
community
of
all
creation
is
,
then
,
the
ultimate
object
of
our
loyalty
and
the
concrete
norm
of
all
moral
judgment
.

Thus
,
moral
issues
concerning
the
nature
of
the
legal
and
political
processes
take
on
theological
dimensions
.

If
we
look
about
the
world
today
,
we
can
see
clearly
that
there
are
two
especially
significant
factors
shaping
the
future
of
our
civilization
:
science
and
religion
.

We
may
feel
pessimistic
at
the
outlook
.

To
see
this
vision
in
perspective
,
we
need
first
of
all
a
clear
idea
of
the
magnitude
of
this
new
power
from
the
atom
.

It
was
only
about
the
size
of
a
baseball
;
;

but
packed
in
that
metallic
ball
there
was
the
explosive
force
of
20,000
tons
of
Aj
.

water
is
Af
and
the
H
stands
for
hydrogen
;
;

I
have
calculated
that
if
I
could
snap
my
fingers
in
one
magic
gesture
to
release
the
power
of
all
the
hydrogen
in
my
body
,
I
would
explode
with
the
force
of
a
hundred
bombs
of
the
kind
that
fell
on
Hiroshima
.

And
then
think
how
little
hydrogen
we
have
in
us
compared
with
the
hydrogen
in
Delaware
Bay
or
in
the
ocean
beyond
.

For
if
I
knew
the
secret
of
letting
this
power
in
my
body
change
directly
into
electricity
,
I
could
rent
myself
out
to
the
electric
companies
and
with
just
the
power
in
my
body
I
could
light
all
the
lights
and
run
all
the
factories
in
the
entire
United
States
for
some
days
.

With
just
the
hydrogen
of
our
bodies
,
we
could
run
the
world
for
years
.

Now
let
us
see
where
this
power
comes
from
.

we
cover
each
of
these
with
our
blanket
of
peas
and
then
at
last
we
have
octillion
peas
corresponding
in
number
to
the
atoms
in
the
body
.

Then
this
atom
of
calcium
will
swell
to
something
like
a
great
balloon
a
hundred
yards
across
,
a
balloon
big
enough
to
put
a
football
field
inside
.

Someone
has
remarked
that
this
is
certainly
the
ultimate
in
reducing
.

and
in
mechanics
the
whole
is
no
more
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
.

So
if
you
are
made
of
atoms
,
you
are
just
a
big
machine
;
;

It
is
a
music
like
the
music
from
a
great
organ
or
a
vast
orchestra
playing
a
symphony
.

And
so
today
when
we
examine
the
structure
of
our
knowledge
of
the
atom
and
of
the
universe
,
we
are
forced
to
conclude
that
the
best
word
to
describe
our
universe
is
music
.

The
Island
of
Nantucket
,
part
of
the
State
of
Massachusetts
,
lies
about
thirty-one
miles
southeast
of
its
mother
State
.

the
rest
is
obtained
from
harbor
scallops
.

During
about
three
and
a
half
months
of
the
year
,
in
the
summer
,
there
are
three
boats
that
run
from
the
mainland
to
the
Island
carrying
passengers
,
food
,
and
cars
;
;

but
the
rest
of
the
year
only
one
boat
is
needed
,
which
ties
up
at
the
mainland
nights
and
makes
the
trip
down
to
Nantucket
in
the
daytime
.

At
times
we
can
say
that
it
was
the
major
factor
.

for
still
others
,
mostly
of
the
nineteenth-century
immigration
,
it
was
Roman
Catholicism
,
and
for
a
small
minority
it
was
Eastern
Orthodoxy
.

For
instance
,
we
cannot
know
whether
even
for
church
members
the
degree
of
conformity
to
Christian
standards
of
morality
increased
or
declined
as
the
proportion
of
church
members
in
the
population
rose
.

Yet
this
cannot
be
proved
.

Throughout
the
nineteenth
century
Christianity
exerted
its
influence
on
American
society
as
a
whole
primarily
through
the
Protestantism
of
the
older
stock
.

The
great
seal
of
the
United
States
was
obviously
inspired
by
the
Christian
faith
.

Later
in
the
century
the
dream
again
found
expression
in
the
lines
of
Katherine
Lee
Bates
(
1859-1929
)
,
daughter
and
granddaughter
of
New
England
Congregational
ministers
,
in
her
widely
sung
hymn
,
written
in
1893
,
America
The
Beautiful
,
with
the
words
O
beautiful
for
pilgrim
feet
whose
stern
impassioned
stress
a
thoroughfare
for
freedom
beat
across
the
wilderness
.

Some
have
seen
revivalism
and
the
search
for
Christian
perfection
as
the
fountain-head
of
the
American
hope
.

A
number
were
in
the
nature
of
movements
to
relieve
or
remove
social
ills
.

We
should
recall
the
number
of
movements
for
the
service
of
mankind
which
arose
from
the
kindred
Evangelicalism
of
the
British
Isles
and
the
Pietism
of
the
Continent
of
Europe
--
among
them
prison
reform
,
anti-slavery
measures
,
legislation
for
the
alleviation
of
conditions
of
labour
,
the
Inner
Mission
,
and
the
Red
Cross
.

A
few
of
the
more
prominent
must
serve
as
examples
of
what
a
complete
listing
and
description
would
disclose
.

Several
were
born
in
the
early
decades
and
persisted
throughout
the
century
.

In
the
latter
year
Samuel
Hopkins
,
from
whom
the
Hopkinsian
strain
of
New
England
theology
took
its
name
,
asked
the
Continental
Congress
to
abolish
slavery
.

After
1815
anti-slavery
sentiment
mounted
,
chiefly
among
Protestants
and
those
of
Protestant
background
of
the
older
stock
.

It
was
he
who
turned
the
attention
of
William
Lloyd
Garrison
(
1805-1879
)
to
the
subject
.

Incurably
optimistic
,
dogmatic
,
and
utterly
fearless
,
in
his
youth
a
devout
Baptist
,
in
spite
of
his
friendship
for
the
Quaker
poet
John
Greenleaf
Whittier
(
1807-1892
)
he
eventually
attacked
the
orthodox
churches
for
what
he
deemed
their
cowardly
compromising
on
the
slavery
issue
and
in
his
invariably
ardent
manner
was
emphatically
unorthodox
and
denied
the
plenary
inspiration
of
the
Bible
.

As
a
youth
he
became
one
of
Finney's
band
of
evangelists
and
gave
himself
to
winning
young
men
.

they
were
almost
immediately
worshipped
for
these
newer
,
even
more
terrible
abilities
.

Their
direct
descendants
inherited
not
only
their
worldly
fortunes
,
but
also
the
mandate
of
their
newfound
power
as
spirits
in
the
other
half
of
the
universe
.

Royal
lineages
could
be
based
on
extraordinary
worldly
achievements
translated
into
eternal
otherworldly
power
.

In
this
system
,
no
man
is
exempt
from
obligations
.

Failure
in
daily
moral
and
ethical
duties
to
one's
family
,
outrages
to
community
propriety
,
any
departure
from
rigid
standards
of
moral
excellence
were
offenses
against
the
dead
.

and
the
daily
duties
of
individuals
were
basically
religious
in
nature
.

The
Taoists
were
Quietist
mystics
,
who
saw
an
unchanging
unity
--
the
Tao
--
underlying
all
phenomena
.

Mahayana
Buddhism
was
no
exception
to
these
prevailing
magical
concepts
.

Mahayana
had
gods
,
and
magic
,
a
pantheon
,
heavens
and
hells
,
and
gorgeously
appareled
priests
,
monks
,
and
nuns
,
all
of
whom
wielded
power
over
souls
in
the
other
world
.

Nonmagical
Confucianism
was
a
secular
,
rational
philosophy
,
but
even
with
this
different
orientation
it
could
not
escape
from
the
ethos
of
a
cosmic
government
.

If
a
man
lived
a
classical
life
,
he
need
not
fear
the
spirits
--
for
only
lack
of
virtue
gave
the
spirits
power
over
him
.

In
fact
,
the
antipathy
to
outward
ceremonies
hailed
by
modern
exponents
as
so
uniquely
characteristic
of
the
direct
thinking
Zennist
was
a
feature
of
Taoism
.

So
,
too
,
was
the
insistence
on
the
relativity
of
the
external
world
,
and
the
ideas
that
language
and
things
perceived
by
consciousness
were
poor
substitutes
indeed
for
immediate
perception
by
pure
,
indwelling
spirit
:
the
opposition
of
pure
consciousness
to
ratiocinating
consciousness
.

One
of
its
features
attractive
to
the
West
is
its
irreverence
for
tradition
and
dogma
and
for
sacred
texts
.

The
truth
--
the
Eternal
Truth
--
is
not
transmittable
by
words
.

Thus
,
the
Mahayana
metaphysic
of
mystical
union
for
salvation
was
distilled
down
to
a
bare
self-seeking
,
and
for
this
reason
,
the
mystic
in
Asia
did
not
long
remain
in
isolated
contemplation
.

Thereupon
Hwang
Pah
said
:
If
I
knew
thou
art
an
Arhat
,
I
would
have
doubled
you
up
before
thou
got
over
there
!
!

The
monk
then
understood
the
spiritual
attainment
of
Hwang
Pah
,
and
praised
him
as
a
true
Mahayanist
.

Modern
Zen
presentation
to
the
West
insists
on
the
anti-authoritarian
,
highly
pragmatic
nature
of
the
Zen
belief
--
scriptures
are
burned
to
make
fire
,
action
is
based
on
direct
self-confidence
,
and
so
on
.

The
new
birth
is
necessary
because
god
is
holy
.

for
it
is
written
,
You
shall
be
holy
,
because
I
am
holy
.

Holiness
without
which
no
man
will
see
God
.

All
have
sinned
and
have
need
of
the
glory
of
God
.

Romans
3
:
10-12
,
23
.

Ephesians
2
:
1
.

The
new
birth
is
effected
through
the
word
of
God

Of
his
own
will
he
has
begotten
us
by
the
word
of
truth
.

St.
John
12
,
13
.

Cf.
1
St.
John
2
:
1
)
.

If
you
know
that
he
(
God
)
is
just
(
righteous
)
,
know
that
everyone
also
who
does
what
is
just
(
righteous
)
has
been
born
of
him
.

1
St.
John

:

.

1
St.
John
5
:
4
.

If
we
are
born
of
God
we
persevere
unto
the
end
.

Now
to
him
who
is
able
to
preserve
you
without
sin
and
to
set
you
before
the
presence
of
his
glory
,
without
blemish
,
in
gladness
,
to
the
only
God
our
Savior
,
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord
,
belong
glory
and
majesty
,
dominion
and
authority
,
before
all
time
,
and
now
,
and
forever
.

That
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
;
;

and
that
which
is
born
of
the
Spirit
is
spirit
.

St.
John
3
:
3
,
5-7
.

For
in
Christ
Jesus
neither
circumcision
nor
uncircumcision
but
a
new
creation
is
of
any
account
.

He
who
has
the
Son
has
the
life
.

He
who
believes
in
the
Son
(
Jesus
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
)
,
has
everlasting
life
.

The
new
birth
is
Christ
living
in
you
by
faith
.

It
is
now
no
longer
I
that
live
,
but
Christ
lives
in
me
.

the
new
birth
is
a
work
of
god
.

to
those
who
believe
in
his
name
:
Who
were
born
not
of
blood
,
nor
of
the
will
of
the
flesh
,
nor
of
the
will
of
man
,
but
of
God
.

you
cannot
go
to
heaven
unless
you
are
born
again
.

You
must
be
born
again
(
St.
John
3
:
7
)
.

They
called
Him
a
devil
.

You
can
ignore
Him
.

You
can
ignore
His
Book
,
the
Bible
,
and
His
church
.

On
the
other
hand
,
you
may
seek
His
favor
,
humble
yourself
before
Him
and
beg
His
mercy
,
implore
His
forgiveness
,
forsake
your
sins
,
and
abandon
your
whole
life
to
Him
.

The
choice
is
yours
:
the
revellings
and
banquetings
of
this
world
or
quiet
communion
with
God
;
;

my
name
is
Guideposts

;

Some
work
with
their
hands
.

Some
have
walked
through
pain
and
sorrow
to
bring
you
their
message
of
hope
.

To
me
,
the
explanation
is
very
simple
.

I
am
not
doing
anything
,
of
myself
.

It
is
the
power
that
holds
the
stars
in
their
orbits
,
but
allows
the
wind
to
bend
a
blade
of
grass
.

The
people
who
told
the
stories
were
sincere
.

That
was
nearly
13
years
ago
.

That
was
when
a
remarkable
woman
,
Teresa
Durlach
,
came
to
my
aid
--
not
so
much
with
money
,
as
with
wisdom
and
courage
.

And
the
100,000
subscribers
became
a
reality
.

With
our
growth
came
expansion
into
new
fields
of
service
.

Thousands
of
free
copies
are
sent
each
month
to
chaplains
in
the
Armed
Forces
,
to
prison
libraries
and
to
hospitals
everywhere
.

world-famous

Rose
Weiss
,
who
handles
all
the
prayer-requests
that
we
receive
,
answering
each
letter
personally
,
has
the
serene
selflessness
that
comes
from
suffering
:
she
has
had
many
major
operations
,
and
now
gets
about
in
a
limited
way
on
braces
and

.

Recently
,
John
Sherrill
was
stricken
with
one
of
the
deadliest
forms
of
cancer
.

Serious
,
yes
,
but
also
much
laughter
.

Sharp
division
of
opinion
,
too
,
and
strenuous
debate
.

And
there
is
also
something
intangible
that
hovers
around
the
table
.

A
shorter
word
is
.

Each
meeting
starts
with
a
prayer
,
offered
spontaneously
by
one
member
of
the
group
.

Havana
was
filled
with
an
excitement
which
you
could
see
in
the
brightness
of
men's
eyes
and
hear
in
the
pitch
of
their
voices
.

Diario
De
La
Marina
was
the
oldest
and
most
influential
paper
in
Cuba
,
with
a
reputation
for
speaking
out
against
tyranny
.

When
it
was
my
turn
,
I
,
too
,
printed
the
truth
as
I
knew
it
about
Batista
,
and
rejoiced
to
see
his
regime
topple
.

Under
another
law
,
hundreds
of
farms
were
seized
.

A
suspicion
was
growing
that
Fidel
Castro
was
a
Communist
.

In
my
mind
,
I
began
to
review
:
his
use
of
hate
to
gain
support
;
;

his
People's
Courts
;
;

many
came
from
Communist
countries
.

What
should
I
do
about
it
,
I
asked
myself
?
?

the
thump
and
whir
of
our
new
presses
.

whaddya
gonna
do
with
all
those
muscles
(
of
which
he
has
none
at
the
time
)
?
?

After
all
,
a
guy's
gotta
have
a
little
ego
!
!

And
they
couldn't
have
entrusted
Henri
to
better
hands
because
le
professeur
knows
his
muscles
from
the
sterno-cleido
mastoideus
of
the
neck
right
down
to
the
tibialis
anticus
of
the
leg
and
better
still
,
he
knows
just
what
exercises
work
best
for
them
and
what
Weider
principles
to
combine
them
with
for
fast
,
fast
muscle
growth
.

There's
Gaetan
D'Amours
who
is
our
newest
Mr.
Canada
;
;

And
at
once
Claude
saw
what
the
trouble
was
and
he
knew
just
how
to
correct
it
.

As
you
can
see
,
in
this
Push-Pull
Super
Set
the
entire
chest-back-shoulder
area
is
vigorously
exercised
in
alternate
sectors
by
alternate
exercises
so
the
complete
torso
remains
pumped-up
all
the
time
!
!

In
the
third
Push-Pull
Super-Set
the
push
exercise
is
the
widegrip
Pushup
Between
Bars
,
while
the
pull
exercise
is
the
Moon
Bench
Lateral
Raise
with
bent
arms
.

You'll
know
when
you've
made
the
greatest
stretch
because
your
shoulder
blades
will
touch
!
!

The
last
exercise
of
Roland
Claude's
prescribed
program
for
Henri
is
a
single
exercise
,
done
in
individual
sets
with
a
bit
longer
pause
between
sets
.

that
steel-edged
carved-out-of-solid
rock
looks
of
the
great
champions
.

Physique
contests
are
rarely
won
on
muscle
size
alone
.

But
contest
definition
--
that
dramatic
muscular
separation
of
every
muscle
group
that
seems
as
though
it
must
have
been
carved
by
a
sculptor's
chisel
--
is
something
quite
different
.

Only
when
the
newest
Mr.
America
or
Mr.
Universe
discovers
them
and
puts
them
into
practice
are
we
reacquainted
with
them
and
once
again
see
how
effective
they
really
are
.

The
exercise
I
shall
discuss
in
this
--
the
first
of
a
new
series
of
articles
on
muscle
definition-specialization
of
a
particular
body
part
--
is
the
One
Leg
Lunge
.

a
criterion
of
muscle
drama
that
is
unforgettable
to
judges
and
audiences
alike
;
;

Definition
of
the
thighs
at
the
uppermost
part
is
quite
commonly
seen
in
most
championship
Olympic
lifters
which
is
easily
understandable
.

The
One
Leg
Lunge
is
a
split
and
all
lifters
practice
this
in
their
regular
workouts
.

Used
in
several
sets
of
high
reps
once
or
twice
each
week
it
will
not
be
long
before
your
entire
upper
leg
takes
on
a
razor-sharp
definition
in
which
the
muscles
look
like
wire
cables
writhing
and
twisting
under
the
skin
!
!

Place
your
Power
Stands
in
position
and
adjust
their
height
so
that
this
will
correspond
to
the
height
of
your
shoulders
when
you
are
in
a
deep
leg
split
as
for
a
heavy
Clean
.

That's
the
One-Leg
Lunge
in
a
nutshell
.

Although
I
suggested
that
you
hold
the
bar
at
the
back
of
the
neck
there's
no
reason
why
you
shouldn't
make
some
experiments
with
the
bar
held
in
front
of
the
neck
.

The
more
I
talked
with
him
,
the
more
convinced
I
became
that
that
was
the
secret
of
their
riotous
blooming
.

I
asked
him
if
he
took
seeds
from
his
own
plants
.

I
like
to
make
a
seedbed
right
in
the
open
,
though
many
people
start
them
successfully
in
cold
frames
.

For
my
seedbed
I
use
good
garden
soil
with
a
little
sand
added
to
encourage
rooting
.

I
like
sawdust
for
this
,
or
hay
.

Every
time
you
transplant
a
pansy
you
cause
its
flowers
to
become
smaller
.

In
addition
to
the
rich
soil
they
benefit
by
feedings
of
manure
water
every
other
week
,
diluted
to
the
color
of
weak
tea
.

Whenever
there
is
a
thaw
or
a
few
sunny
days
,
you'll
be
likely
to
find
a
brave
little
blossom
or
two
.

I
started
the
seed
in
a
flat
in
June
and
set
out
the
little
pansies
in
a
cold
frame
.

(
An
unheated
greenhouse
would
have
been
better
,
if
I
had
had
one
.

In
response
to
the
lengthening
days
of
February
they
budded
,
then
bloomed
their
4-inch
velvety
flowers
.

The
day
will
come
,
in
midsummer
,
when
you
find
your
plants
becoming
leggy
,
running
to
tall-growing
foliage
at
the
expense
of
blossoms
.

Probably
no
one
needs
to
tell
you
that
the
way
to
stop
all
bloom
is
to
let
the
blossoms
go
to
seed
.

It
is
no
harder
to
raise
big
,
healthy
,
blooming
plants
than
weak
,
sickly
little
things
;
;

If
the
plants
are
cared
for
and
protected
over
the
winter
,
the
second
year
is
more
prolific
than
the
first
.

Give
them
food
,
some
shade
,
mulch
,
water
and
more
food
,
and
they'll
repay
your
solicitude
with
beauty
.

A
salad
with
greens
and
tomato
is
a
popular
and
wonderfully
healthful
addition
to
a
meal
,
but
add
an
avocado
and
you
have
something
really
special
.

It
is
a
flavor
that
might
take
a
little
getting
used
to
--
not
because
it
is
unpleasant
,
but
because
the
flavor
is
hard
to
define
in
the
light
of
our
experience
with
other
fruits
.

Sometimes
it
takes
several
eatings
of
avocado
to
catch
that
delightful
quality
in
taste
that
has
made
it
such
a
favorite
throughout
the
world
.

The
fruit
is
then
cooled
to
42-degrees-F.
,
a
temperature
at
which
it
lapses
into
a
sort
of
dormant
state
.

Avocados
,
however
,
are
very
rich
in
nutrients
.

They
were
put
on
control
diets
to
determine
as
accurately
as
possible
,
the
normal
cholesterol
level
of
their
blood
.

They
could
be
used
to
attack
a
nation's
people
(
which
would
inevitably
mean
the
loss
of
the
attacker's
own
people
)
,
or
they
could
be
used
with
discrimination
to
destroy
the
enemy's
military
force
.

Because
of
this
,
it
would
appear
inevitable
that
an
increasing
percentage
of
strategic
missiles
will
seek
self-protection
in
mobility
--
at
least
until
missile
defenses
are
perfected
which
have
an
exceedingly
high
kill
probability
.

Until
this
hunter-killer
operation
can
be
performed
by
spacecraft
,
manned
aircraft
appear
to
be
the
only
means
available
to
us
.

It
is
entirely
feasible
to
employ
aircraft
such
as
the
B-52
or
B-70
in
hunter-killer
operations
against
Soviet
railway-based
missiles
.

Is
there
any
other
way
to
do
the
job
?
?

but
the
airfield
,
on
which
the
aircraft
is
completely
dependent
,
is
doomed
by
the
missile
.

Eliminate
the
vulnerability
of
aircraft
on
the
ground
and
you
have
essentially
eliminated
its
vulnerability
to
long-range
ballistic
missiles
.

There
are
four
rather
obvious
ways
to
reduce
or
eliminate
the
vulnerability
of
aircraft
on
the
ground
:

Put
aircraft
in
bomb-proof
hangars
when
they
are
on
the
ground
.

Build
long-range
aircraft
which
can
take
off
from
small
(
3,000-foot
)
airfields
with
runways
.

We
could
put
a
portion
of
our
strategic
bombers
in
such
shelters
.

This
same
preoccupation
with
missiles
at
the
expense
of
aircraft
has
resulted
in
our
half-hearted
effort
to
develop
nuclear
propulsion
for
aircraft
.

With
powerplants
such
as
these
,
vertical
takeoff
and
landing
combat
aircraft
could
be
built
.

We
would
have
the
means
to
seek
out
and
destroy
the
enemy's
force
--
whether
it
were
fixed
or
mobile
.

With
such
a
force
of
manned
bombers
we
could
bring
enormous
pressure
to
bear
on
an
enemy
,
and
this
pressure
would
be
selective
and
extremely
discriminating
.

No
need
to
kill
an
entire
city
and
all
its
people
because
we
lacked
the
precision
and
reconnaissance
to
selectively
disarm
the
enemy's
military
force
.

In
a
few
years
we
will
have
SAMOS
(
semiautomatic
missile
observation
system
)
.

What
targets
still
remain
to
be
hit
?
?

These
crucial
questions
must
be
answered
by
post-attack
reconnaissance
.

Even
if
this
is
some
day
possible
,
there
remains
the
30-minute
time
of
flight
of
a
missile
to
its
overseas
target
.

It
would
be
priceless
to
have
an
aircraft
to
gather
that
post-attack
reconnaissance
.

A
large
aircraft
,
such
as
the
B-52
or
B-70
,
could
carry
perhaps
50
or
100
small
nuclear
weapons
.

Since
it
requires
only
five
players
,
it
would
seem
to
fall
into
the
category
of
chamber
music
--
yet
it
calls
for
a
double
bass
,
an
instrument
generally
regarded
as
symphonic
.

This
is
a
serious-minded
interpretation
,
but
it
is
never
strait-laced
.

The
twenty-five-year-old
recording
offers
rather
faded
string
tone
,
but
the
balance
between
the
instruments
is
good
and
the
transfer
is
very
quiet
.

There
is
a
break
in
continuity
just
before
the
fourth
variation
in
the
Forellen
movement
,
and
I
suspect
that
this
is
due
to
imperfect
splicing
between
sides
of
the
original
Aj
.

Some
of
Curzon's
playing
strikes
me
as
finicky
,
however
.

It
is
,
moreover
,
a
perfectly
integrated
ensemble
effort
.

Aeschbacher's
work
is
very
much
akin
to
Schnabel's
,
but
the
sound
on
his
Decca
disc
is
dated
,
and
you
will
have
a
hard
time
locating
a
copy
of
it
.

Telefunken
has
accorded
him
beautiful
sound
,
and
this
bargain-priced
disc
(
it
sells
for
$2.98
)
is
worthy
of
consideration
.

This
recording
surely
belongs
in
everyone's
collection
.

Seen
in
perspective
,
many
of
these
releases
have
a
genuine
claim
to
be
milestones
.

Although
lacking
absolute
verisimilitude
,
they
supply
the
ear
and
the
imagination
with
all
necessary
materials
for
re-creation
of
the
original
.

Some
of
them
are
obvious
,
such
as
the
fact
that
we
associate
recorded
and
live
music
with
our
responses
and
behavior
in
different
types
of
environments
and
social
settings
.

Like
the
recent
Scheherazade
from
London
(
High
Fidelity
,
Sept.
1961
)
,
it
is
successful
because
emphasis
has
been
placed
on
good
musical
and
engineering
practices
rather
than
on
creating
sensational
effects
.

Command
has
achieved
the
ideal
amount
of
reverberation
.

For
me
it
has
more
of
both
elements
than
the
majority
of
its
competitors
.

Those
accustomed
to
broader
,
more
romantic
statements
of
the
symphony
can
be
expected
to
react
strongly
when
they
hear
this
one
.

The
Presto
Ma
non
assai
of
the
first
trio
of
the
scherzo
is
taken
literally
and
may
shock
you
,
as
the
real
Allegro
con
Spirito
of
the
finale
is
likely
to
bring
you
to
your
feet
.

Too
many
records
seem
to
reduce
a
work
of
symphonic
complexity
to
a
melody
and
its
accompaniment
.

The
Command
technique
invites
you
to
listen
to
the
depth
of
the
orchestration
.

The
Class
had
entries
from
as
far
west
as
Wisconsin
and
as
far
south
as
Kentucky
.

This
year
several
entries
from
Canada
were
entered
which
made
the
Junior
Class
International
.

Forty-six
of
the
53
Juniors
who
mailed
in
entries
were
present
.

It
was
interesting
to
note
that
many
of
these
Juniors
were
showing
dogs
in
various
other
classes
at
the
show
prior
to
the
Finals
of
the
Junior
Class
.

Mrs.
Long
still
feels
the
same
unique
spirit
of
Westminster
which
she
stated
the
present
Juniors
will
experience
today
but
probably
will
not
appreciate
in
full
for
a
number
of
years
.

Speaking
from
long
years
of
experience
,
Mrs.
Long
advised
the
Juniors
:
When
showing
dogs
ceases
to
be
fun
and
excitement
,
stop
!
!

When
you
and
your
dog
step
into
the
Junior
ring
,
it
should
be
just
what
the
dog
wants
to
do
as
much
as
what
you
want
him
to
do
.

Your
aids
are
your
attitude
,
which
comes
through
your
voice
,
your
hands
and
legs
--
voice
to
encourage
,
discourage
or
whatever
the
need
may
be
;
;

hands
to
guide
or
restrain
;
;

And
may
you
all
continue
to
show
at
Westminster
in
the
years
to
come
!
!

Mr.
Barcus
spoke
on
the
subject
of
scholarships
for
Juniors
--
with
which
he
is
very
familiar
.

Junior
Showmanship
is
an
extremely
worthy
project
and
should
be
earnestly
encouraged
!
!

In
closing
,
Mr.
Barcus
also
wished
all
the
Juniors
luck
in
their
Class
.

Instead
of
3
a.m.
in
the
past
,
the
Juniors
Class
at
Westminster
was
held
at
4:45
p.m.
.

From
there
on
,
each
Junior
was
going
to
be
judged
individually
.

A
Junior
who
won
two
or
more
wins
in
the
Open
Class
was
eligible
.

International
Champion
of
the
year

Last
year
Susan
also
placed
3rd
in
the
Finals
at
Westminster
.

Most
Juniors
who
were
entered
in
the
Finals
are
seasoned
campaigners
and
not
only
show
and
win
in
Junior
Classes
but
score
in
the
Breed
Classes
as
well
.

Judging
class
for
intermediates
proposed

The
Intermediates
in
the
Class
with
the
Judge
were
asked
to
pick
4
winners
and
give
their
reasons
but
their
decisions
did
not
affect
the
choice
of
the
Judge
.

We
suggested
this
Class
in
the
horse
world
and
it
was
accepted
immediately
and
included
in
the
programs
of
horse
shows
.

If
the
superintendents
do
not
receive
more
cooperation
from
Handlers
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
licensed
Judges
also
be
qualified
to
judge
this
Class
.

Are
they
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
the
dog
can
easily
pick
up
germs
from
the
preceding
patient
?
?

There
are
more
than
8,000,000
recreational
boats
in
use
in
the
United
States
with
almost
10,000,000
the
prediction
for
within
the
next
decade
.

In
1959
,
according
to
the
Engineers
,
Lake
Texoma
was
only
one
of
thirty-two
artificial
lakes
and
reservoirs
which
were
used
for
recreation
by
over
1,000,000
persons
.

It
is
a
simple
task
to
haul
a
boat
fifty
or
one
hundred
miles
to
a
lake
or
reservoir
on
the
new
,
light
,
strong
,
easy-to-operate
trailers
which
are
built
to
accommodate
almost
any
kind
of
small
boat
and
retail
from
$100
to
$2,000
.

And
trailers
for
boats
are
not
what
they
started
out
to
be
ten
years
ago
.

They
range
from
an
eight-foot
pram
,
which
you
can
build
yourself
for
less
than
$50
,
to
auxiliary
sailboats
which
can
cost
over
$100,000
.

You
name
it
,
our
industry
is
producing
it
,
and
it
probably
is
made
in
different
models
.

There
are
houseboats
which
are
literally
homes
afloat
,
accommodating
whole
families
in
comfort
and
convenience
.

Russia
,
whose
technology
is
not
quite
primitive
,
is
still
in
the
dark
ages
when
it
comes
to
improving
the
outboard
motor
,
for
instance
.

Terms
and
rates
of
interest
for
motors
generally
follow
those
for
home
appliances
.

Man
had
enough
to
worry
about
managing
to
get
up
there
and
stay
without
being
burdened
with
rules
once
aloft
.

Foreseeing
the
possible
threats
to
safety
with
the
rapid
growth
of
the
sport
,
the
industry
has
been
supporting
an
intense
,
coordinated
educational
program
with
great
success
since
1947
.

These
are
not
governmentally
subsidized
organizations
.

Regardless
of
nomenclature
,
yachtels
and
boatels
are
marinas
.

Boatyards
which
also
provide
some
of
the
above
facilities
may
rightfully
be
called
marinas
.

The
design
of
a
mechanical
interlocking
frame
is
much
like
a
mechanical
puzzle
,
but
once
understood
,
the
principles
can
be
applied
to
any
track
and
signal
arrangement
.

The
main
set
of
bars
are
the
tappets
and
one
tappet
is
connected
to
each
lever
.

Close
behind
the
plane
of
the
tappets
are
the
locking
bars
.

In
the
sides
of
the
tappets
are
notches
with
sloping
sides
,
and
connection
between
the
tappets
and
locking
bars
consist
of
cams
called
dogs
.

Two
or
more
dogs
are
mounted
on
each
locking
bar
.

These
slide
into
and
out
of
the
notches
in
the
tappets
as
the
tappets
are
moved
,
locking
and
unlocking
them
.

By
this
scheme
,
pulling
one
signal
to
clear
locks
all
the
other
switch
and
signal
levers
in
safe
positions
until
the
first
signal
is
again
restored
to
normal
.

This
is
not
necessarily
to
green
,
however
,
for
in
some
situations
only
a
yellow
indication
is
given
to
a
train
to
let
it
into
the
plant
.

If
the
points
aren't
thrown
all
the
way
,
the
Turnout
cannot
be
locked
,
and
in
turn
,
the
signal
cannot
be
cleared
.

As
an
engineer
approaches
the
plant
the
position
of
the
home
signal
is
seen
in
advance
when
he
passes
the
distant
signal
located
beyond
the
limits
of
the
interlocking
plant
.

In
some
low-speed
situations
,
the
distant
signal
is
fixed
at
caution
.

This
gives
you
the
spacing
for
locating
the
left-hand
piece
B
.

There
should
be
10''
between
the
two
parallel
members
and
each
should
be
1''
from
an
end
of
the
long
piece
.

Cap
the
locking
bar
spacers
with
two
Af
directly
under
the
first
two
B
pieces
.

Mark
and
center-punch
all
the
holes
required
for
screws
to
hold
this
assembly
together
.

Drill
two
No.
50
holes
,
one
in
the
insert
and
one
in
the
locking
bar
spacer
directly
above
it
,
and
tap
2-56
.

These
are
supporting
members
for
the
short
locking
bars
.

Locate
their
positions
in
Fig.
7
and
drill
No.

to
match
the
corresponding
holes
in
the
frame
.

Drill
a
No.
50
hole
from
one
end
and

Drill
a
No.

hole
crosswise
through
the
tappet
at
the
position

in
Figs.

.

Scribe
V-shaped
lines
on
the
bar
and
rough

with
either
a
hack

or
a
cutting

in
a

tool
.

Assemble
the
parts
in

however
,
he
will
have
a
clearer
understanding
of
what
he
is
doing
and
the
chances
are
he
will
be
more
successful
if
he
understands
the
few
formulas
that
apply
to
rodding
.

However
,
it
is
essential
that
the
various
mathematical
symbols
used
in
the
equations
be
understood
so
that
the
mathematical
processes
can
be
done
properly
and
in
their
correct
order
.

The
symbol
for
division
is
a
straight
line
that
separates
two
numbers
placed
one
above
the
other
.

Numbers
to
be
multiplied
together
may
be
multiplied
in
any
order
.

Numbers
separated
by
addition
symbols
may
be
placed
in
any
order
.

Multiplication
,
subtraction
,
and
addition
can
then
be
accomplished
as
they
appear
in
the
equation
by
starting
at
the
left
end
of
the
equation
and
working
toward
the
right
.

Completing
the
division
first
also
includes
those
division
parts
that
require
multiplication
,
subtraction
,
or
addition
steps
:
Af
.

We'll
take
them
in
the
general
order
of
their
popularity
.

Actually
,
the
engine
displacement
formula
is
the
standard
formula
for
computing
the
volume
of
a
cylinder
of
any
type
with
an
added
factor
that
represents
the
number
of
cylinders
in
the
engine
.

The
different
steps
will
look
like
this
:
Af

A
cylinder's
compression
ratio
is
computed
by
comparing
the
cylinder's
volume
,
or
its
displacement
,
with
the
total
volume
of
the
cylinder
and
its
combustion
chamber
.

Do
not
overfill
the
chamber
.

This
is
possible
with
water
and
other
liquids
that
have
a
high
surface
tension
.

The
amount
of
liquid
poured
into
the
chamber
is
determined
by
subtracting
the
quantity
still
in
the
beaker
when
the
chamber
is
full
from
the
original
quantity
.

Most
beakers
are
graduated
in
cubic
centimeters
(
cc.
)
,
making
it
necessary
to
convert
the
result
to
cubic
inches
.

The
compression
ratio
arrived
at
with
the
formula
will
be
the
same
regardless
of
whether
cubic
inches
or
cubic
centimeters
are
used
.

Another
thing
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
is
the
volume
of
the
area
between
the
top
of
the
piston
and
the
top
of
the
cylinder
block
when
the
piston
is
in
top
dead
center
position
.

MPH
for
Car
speed

,
for
Engine
crankshaft
speed

,
for
Tire
size

This
is
done
by
measuring
the
distance
from
the
surface
on
which
the
tire
is
resting
to
the
center
of
the
rear
axle
shaft
.

Any
fraction
of
an
inch
involved
in
the
measurement
must
be
converted
to
a
decimal
equivalent
to
simplify
the
mathematics
.

To
determine
engine
speed
for
a
given
combination
of
the
other
three
factors
the
formula
is
:
Af
.

To
determine
the
rear
axle
gear
ratio
for
a
combination
of
the
other
three
factors

The
average
reader
of
this
magazine
owns
more
than
one
gun
(
we
ran
a
survey
to
find
out
)
but
he's
always
on
the
lookout
for
new
and
better
arms
.

Here
they
are
,
with
my
comments
and
judgments
.

Read
on
,
take
your
pick
--
and
start
dropping
those
hints
.

First
on
my
own
list
would
be
two
arms
--
a
rifle
and
a
handgun
--
that
qualify
as
new
in
the
strictest
sense
.

Ruger
reports
that
on
his
recent
African
safari
the
little
Magnum
cartridge
was
a
real
work
horse
.

these
are
fairly
large
,
tough
animals
.

The
deadliness
of
the
Magnum
in
a
rifle
comes
as
no
surprise
to
me
.

At
least
five
years
ago

Tom
Robinson
of
Marlin
made
up
an
double
rifle
for
me
in
this
caliber
,
using
the
now
defunct
Model
90
action
in
20-gauge
size
.

We
quickly
ran
into
the
same
trouble
that
plagued
Bill
Ruger
in
his
first
experiments
:
Three
or
four
bullets
would
be
placed
well
in
a
six-inch
bull
at
100
yards
and
then
,
unaccountably
,
one
could
stray
far
out
of
the
group
.

Within
half
an
hour
I
jumped
a
six-point
buck
that
hop-skipped
through
a
rhododendron
thicket
,
and
I
caught
him
just
behind
the
left
foreleg
at
60
yards
.

The
Deerstalker
points
with
the
ease
,
speed
and
precision
of
a
fine
imported
double
shotgun
,
and
its
trigger
pull
is
light
and
sharp
.

The
second
really
new
development
this
year
was
a
revolver
handling
a
different
sort
of
varmint
load
--

field
and
special
(
less
than
$45
and
just
over
$45
,
respectively
)
.

It's
a
streamlined
rifle
,
fast
and
well-made
.

Previously
known
as
Jefferson
Arms
,
Kodiak
has
given
this
11-shot
hammerless
job
an
exceptionally
fine
stock
design
,
and
the
260
is
the
first
autoloader
to
handle

The
Model
99
(
under
$45
)
is
a
light-weight
,
streamlined

The
989
(
about
$40
)
is
an
even
newer

A
spring
trap
for
solid
mounting
and
a
regular
hand
trap
are
also
available
.

This
design
is
hard
to
beat
for
timber
hunting
or
for
packing
in
a
saddle
scabbard
.

Because
of
its
traditional
lines
,
it
probably
has
more
kid
appeal
than
any
other
model
.

it's
just
right
for
a
boy
of
.

many
experienced
hunters
like
this
gauge
and
type
of
scattergun
too
.

For
example
,
a
Browning
trap
version
of
the
Superposed
,
the
Broadway
(
from
$350
up
,
depending
on
grade
)
,
differs
from
standard
models
in
that
it
is
equipped
with
a
full
beavertail
fore
end
,
a
cushion
recoil
pad
and
a
barrel-wide
ventilated
rib
for
fast
sighting
.

The
Colt
line
now
includes
a
new
scattergun
,
the
Standard
or
Custom
Pump
Model
(
about
$90
and
$150
,
respectively
)
in
12
,
16
and
20
.

Jet
--
which
I
coupled
with
the
Deerstalker
carbine
as
one
of
the
year's
two
biggest
developments
--
few
significant
innovations
appeared
among
1961's
handguns
.

His
patronage
on
this
stretch
was
made
up
largely
of
San
Franciscans
--
regulars
,
most
of
them
,
and
trenchermen
like
himself
.

Gazing
too
long
at
the
scenery
could
be
tiring
,
so
halts
were
contrived
between
meals
.

In
the
1890's
the
Palace
Hotel
began
serving
an
oyster
dish
named
after
its
manager
,
John
C.
Kirkpatrick
.

(
Gastronomes
have
long
argued
about
which
came
first
,
the
Palace's
or
Antoine's
.

The
tallyho
had
cost
Vernon
$2,300
.

One
could
shave
in
the
reflection
of
its
French-polished
panels
,
and
its
axles
were
greased
like
those
of
roulette
wheels
.

There
are
many
ways
of
making
a
kedgeree
,
every
one
of
which
is
right
.

Heat
and
serve
hot
on
toast
.

The
omelet
named
for
Ernest
Arbogast
,
the
Palace's
chef
,
was
even
more
in
demand
.

A
jigger
of
dry
Sherry
follows
,
and
as
the
mixture
stiffens
,
in
go
a
hundred
of
the
little
oysters
.

Sherry
remained
in
his
hotel
suite
,
where
he
amused
himself
as
best
he
could
.

A
number
of
them
must
have
fallen
into
disfavor
;
;

they
were
struck
out
with
remarks
in
red
ink
,
denouncing
both
the
cooks
and
the
management
.

)
Apple
trees
grew
there
also
.

The
recipe
,
which
he
got
from
the
baker
,
and
wrote
down
in
his
ledger
,
is
basically
this
:

Let
this
boil
gently
for
twenty
minutes
,
then
strain
.

Those
who
have
never
traveled
the
width
and
length
of
this
land
cannot
conceive
,
on
the
basis
of
textbook
description
alone
,
the
overwhelming
space
and
variety
of
this
country
held
together
under
one
government
.

For
this
reason
,
U.S.
Camera
has
prepared
this
special
U.S.A.
vacation
feature
.

Use
this
section
to
plan
now
to
make
the
most
of
your
vacation
in
photogenic
America
.

The
rolling
farms
of
Maryland
,
the
peerless
metropolis
of
New
York
City
,
the
verdant
mountains
of
Vermont
can
all
be
included
in
your
Northeast
vacation
.

At
Sturbridge
Village
,
Massachusetts
,
you'll
find
a
completely-restored
New
England
town
.

One
of
the
most
exciting
ways
to
end
a
Northeast
vacation
would
be
with
a
week
in
New
York
City
.

Photographing
in
the
Northeast

the
southern
United
States
,
extending
from
Florida
in
the
east
to
Texas
in
the
west
,
still
maintains
its
unique
flavor
of
gracious
living
and
historical
elegance
.

Florida
provides
tropical
scenes
unequalled
in
the
United
States
.

The
great
state
of
Texas
offers
metropolitan
attractions
such
as
the
Dallas
Fair
Park
with
its
art
and
natural
history
museums
.

In
contrast
are
the
vast
open
stretches
of
ranch
country
and
oil
wells
.

Foliage
is
the
outstanding
photo
subject
in
many
of
the
Southern
locales
mentioned
above
and
some
specific
tips
on
how
and
where
to
shoot
it
are
in
order
.

Exposure
problems
may
occur
in
these
forest
areas
where
uneven
lighting
results
from
shafts
of
sunlight
filtering
through
the
overhead
branches
.

A
pleasant
start
to
your
midwestern
vacation
is
a
few
days
spent
in
cosmopolitan
Chicago
.

The
Black
Hills
Passion
Play
is
produced
every
summer
and
is
a
pageant
worth
seeing
and
shooting
.

Of
course
,
while
in
this
vicinity
you
won't
want
to
miss
a
visit
to
Mount
Rushmore
National
Memorial
where
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
are
the
famous
sculptures
of
Presidents
Washington
,
Lincoln
,
Jefferson
and
Theodore
Roosevelt
.

Similarly
in
Illinois
there
is
Lincoln
country
to
be
seen
--
his
tomb
and
other
landmarks
.

Night
scenes
will
add
an
exciting
touch
to
your
vacation
travelogue
and
what
better
place
to
take
them
then
along
Chicago's
Lake
Shore
Drive
?
?

Just
after
sunset
is
a
good
time
to
record
the
city
lights
in
color
since
you
get
a
fill-in
light
from
the
sky
.

A
western
vacation
is
practically
synonymous
with
a
visit
to
at
least
one
of
the
magnificent
national
parks
in
this
area
.

Colorado's
Grand
Canyon
,
probably
the
most
famous
landmark
of
the
United
States
,
can
be
the
highpoint
of
your
Western
vacation
.

At
the
moment
,
many
of
these
are
being
pulled
down
.

Whole
blocks
are
disappearing
and
more
are
scheduled
to
vanish
to
make
room
for
wide
boulevards
that
will
show
off
its
treasures
to
better
advantage
--
the
great
domes
and
graceful
spires
of
its
mosques
,
the
panorama
of
the
Bosphorus
and
the
Golden
Horn
.

In
1453
when
the
last
vestige
of
ancient
Roman
power
fell
to
the
Turks
,
the
city
officially
shifted
religions
--
although
the
Patriarch
,
or
Pope
,
of
the
Orthodox
Church
continued
to
live
there
,
and
still
does
--
and
became
the
capital
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
.

There
the
bus
turned
right
along
the
Bosphorus
,
past
ocean
liners
at
anchor
,
to
Galata
Bridge
over
the
entrance
to
the
Golden
Horn
,
a
brown
sweep
of
water
that
empties
into
the
Bosphorus
.

I
got
off
there
,
crossed
the
street
,
walked
ahead
with
St.
Sophia
on
my
left
,
the
Blue
Mosque
on
my
right
,
and
in
a
moment
came
to
the
entrance
of
St.
Sophia
.

Outside
St.
Sophia
I
walked
through
the
flower
garden
in
front
of
it
,
with
the
Blue
Mosque
ahead
on
my
left
.

Across
the
street
on
my
right
I
saw
the
Hippodrome
,
now
a
park
.

Just
before
coming
to
the
mosque
entrance
I
crossed
the
street
,
entered
the
Hippodrome
,
and
walked
ahead
to
the
Obelisk
of
Theodosius
,
originally
erected
in
Heliopolis
in
Egypt
about
1,600
B.C.
by
Thutmose
,
who
also
built
those
now
in
New
York
,
London
and
Rome
at
the
Lateran
.

Retracing
my
steps
to
the
Mosque
of
Sultan
Ahmet
,
only
one
with
six
minarets
,
I
entered
the
courtyard
,
with
a
gallery
supported
by
pointed
arches
running
around
it
and
a
fountain
in
the
middle
.

The
round
minarets
,
tall
and
graceful
,
rise
from
rectangular
bases
and
have
three
platforms
from
which
the
muezzin
can
chant
his
call
to
prayer
.

It
stands
in
the
middle
of
what
was
once
the
Forum
of
Constantine
,
who
brought
it
from
Rome
.

Called
the
Marmara
Gazinosu
,
it
is
on
the
third
floor
,
with
signs
pointing
the
way
there
,
and
has
a
terrace
overlooking
the
Sea
of
Marmara
.

It's
a
great
favorite
of
the
university
students
,
and
I
joined
them
there
for
dessert
.

There
is
still
water
in
it
.

Passing
through
the
gate
,
with
towers
on
either
side
once
used
as
prisons
,
I
entered
a
huge
square
surrounded
by
buildings
,
and
on
the
wall
to
my
right
found
a
general
plan
of
the
grounds
,
with
explanations
in
English
for
each
building
.

At
one
time
about
10,000
people
lived
there
.

You
can
take
it
with
you
.

Turn
off
at
any
one
of
the
marked
picnic
areas
(
gasoline
companies
have
touring
service
bureaus
that
issue

on

and

--
your
lunch
is
75%
cheaper
than
at
a
restaurant
,
and
100%
more
fun
.

You
need
a
little
stove
,
a
coffee
pot
and
a
stew
pot
;
;

You
only
have
to
think
of
franks
and
sausages
to
know
what
I
mean
.

Go
a
step
further
and
list
all
the
wonderful
barbecue
basics
--
cervelat

salami
,
Vienna
sausages
,
mettwurst
,
bratwurst
,
bockwurst
,
knackwurst
,
Bologna
,
pepperoni
,
blutwurst
--
and
you
have
a
long
list
of
easy
specialties
.

A
story
goes
that
a
certain
Herr
Feuchtwanger
of
St.
Louis
,
around
1883
served
his
sausages
(
grilled
)
and
mustard
to
his
fancy
customers
.

The
nation's
number
one
picnic
treat
is
the
skinless
frankfurter
--
toasted
over
a
bonfire
on
the
beach
or
,
more
sedately
,
charcoal
broiled
on
a
portable
grill
.

--
Score
each
frankfurter
in
four
or
five
places
about
a
third
of
the
way
through
.

Bring
along
the
conventional
ones
--
catsup
,
pickle
relish
,
mustard
,
mayonnaise
--
plus
a
few
extras
,
such
as
tangy
barbecue
sauce
,
chive
cream
cheese
,
or
horse-radish
for
the
brave
ones
in
the
crowd
.

--
An
unusual
flavor
can
be
achieved
by
marinating
the
franks
in
French
dressing
or
a
mixture
of
honey
,
lemon
juice
and
brown
sugar
prior
to
the
picnic
.

In

always
slip

from
one
needle
to
another

She
also
banks
into
a
turn
like
a
fine
runabout
--
not
digging
in
on
the
outside
to
throw
passengers
all
over
the
boat
like
many
a
small
cabin
cruiser
.

Needless
to
say
,
you
can't
build
Hotei
in
a
couple
of
weeks
.

A
comparable
manufactured
boat
would
cost
close
to
$3,000
.

All
framing
in
Hotei
is
one-inch
mahogany
which
,
in
the
dressed
state
you
buy
it
,
is
about
the
thickness
specified
in
the
drawings
.

Therefore
,
the
lumber
is
bought
in
planks
and
ripped
to
size
for
battens
,
etc.
,
on
a
table
saw
.

Besides
flathead
bronze
screws
,
silicon
bronze
Stronghold
nails
(
made
by
Independent
Nail
&
Packing
Co.
,
Bridgewater
,
Mass.
)
are
used
extensively
in
assembly
and
Weldwood
resorcinol
glue
is
used
in
all
the
joints
.

Construction
follows
a
thorough
study
of
the
drawings
.

All
frames
are
butted
at
the
joints
and
plywood
gussets
are
glued
and
nailed
on
each
side
of
each
joint
,
again
using
the
one-inch
,
No.
12
nails
.

The
frames
are
notched
only
for
the
keelson
and
the
chines
.

Nowhere
in
the
boat
do
the
frames
come
in
contact
with
the
plywood
planking
.

After
the
frames
and
transom
are
set
up
on
the
jig
and
temporarily
braced
,
a
piece
of
three-inch-wide
mahogany
(
only
widths
will
be
given
since
the
thickness
is
used
throughout
)
is
butted
between
frames
one
and
two
below
the
line
of
the
keelson
.

Take
two
three-inch-wide
pieces
and
rip
them
down
the
center
of
the
thickness
to
make
the
four
.

Then
spread
a
generous
amount
of
glue
on
the
four
pieces
and
bend
them
into
place
on
the
jig
.

The
first
two
pieces
butt
against
the
inner
member
of
the
keelson
and
are
glued
and
screwed
to
the
brace
between
the
first
two
frames
.

The
second
two
pieces
lap
over
the
inner
member
of
the
keelson
and
butt
against
the
outer
member
.

They
are
glued
and
screwed
to
the
inner
member
of
the
keelson
.

The
side
ones
are
a
half-inch
narrower
.

The
chines
go
in
the
same
way
except
that
they
are
made
of
two
pieces
of
two-inch
wood
for
strength
and
easier
bending
.

I
clamped
a
30-inch
piece
of
aluminum
to
the
base
of
the
planer
with
a
pair
of
Sure
Grips
.

Another
person
inside
with
a
weight
against
each
batten
will
help
in
the
fastening
.

Then
trim
the
excess
.

It's
good
for
cutting
all
the
planking
because
it
cuts
with
a
bit-like
blade
at
high
rpm
and
does
not
chatter
the
plywood
like
a
saber
saw
.

When
cut
,
the
planking
is
clamped
in
place
for
a
final
and
careful
trimming
.

The
spray
rails
are
first
glued
on
the
outside
and
fastened
from
the
inside
with
screws
.

A
50-inch
width
is
used
on
each
side
and
it
laps
the
keel
line
by
about
three
inches
.

Then
remove
it
and
give
the
whole
bottom
a
coat
of
resin
.

Be
sure
it
is
well
saturated
and
then
allow
it
to
harden
.

When
they
are
on
,
the
top
edges
are
planed
even
with
the
sheer
batten
.

The
decking
is
quarter-inch
mahogany
marine
plywood
.

These
battens
are
glued
and
screwed
to
the
frames
.

With
all
deck
battens
in
place
,
the
bilge
is
cleaned
and
painted
up
to
the
floor
line
.

After
the
decking
is
on
,
the
cabin
sides
are
installed
.

A
head
is
a
handy
thing
to
have
and
I
installed
one
under
a
removable
section
of
the
port
bunk
.

The
sink
in
the
hinged
panel
above
the
bunk
drains
into
the
head
and
a
five-gallon
water
tank
is
mounted
on
the
bulkhead
above
the
sink
.

It
is
a
big
project
,
not
to
be
taken
lightly
.

The
roof
timbers
are
precut
and
the
panels
standard
so
that
the
house
can
be
completely
enclosed
in
a
matter
of
three
or
four
days
.

in
a
remote
section
there
might
be
no
restrictions
at
all
.

The
fixed
window
panels
with
louvers
should
have
a
good
grade
of
double-strength
glass
set
in
a
mastic
glazing
compound
.

Other
thicknesses
may
necessitate
ripping
a
special
size
lumber
for
the
glass
trim
.

The
drill
press
consists
of
a
vertical
shaft
(
spindle
)
which
is
tapered
or
threaded
on
one
end
to
hold
a
drill
chuck
,
a
tubular
housing
(
quill
)
in
which
the
spindle
is
mounted
,
a
head
in
which
the
quill
is
mounted
,
a
feed
lever
which
moves
the
quill
up
or
down
,
a
power
source
,
and
a
movable
table
upon
which
the
work
is
placed
.

A
new
radial
drill
press
with
a
16
inch
capacity
has
a
tilting
head
that
allows
drilling
to
be
done
at
any
angle
.

The
drill
press
should
be
leveled
and
,
depending
on
whether
it
is
a
bench
or
floor
model
,
bolted
securely
to
a
sturdy
bench
or
stand
or
screwed
to
the
floor
with
lag
or
expansion
screws
.

A
coat
of
paste
wax
or
a
rubdown
with
a
piece
of
wax
paper
will
protect
the
polished
surface
of
the
table
;
;

The
rest
of
the
press
should
be
kept
clean
by
dusting
with
a
clean
rag
or
brush
.

Most
drill
presses
have
a
quill
return
spring
that
raises
the
spindle
automatically
when
the
feed
lever
is
released
and
holds
the
quill
in
the
raised
position
.

Turning
the
housing
clockwise
will
reduce
tension
,
counter-clockwise
will
increase
it
.

Don't
lose
the
chuck
key

Drill
speeds
are
important
if
you
want
a
good
job
.

Feed
pressure
is
also
of
major
importance
.

Too
much
pressure
will
force
the
tool
beyond
its
cutting
capacity
and
result
in
rough
cuts
and
jammed
or
broken
tools
.

The
best
results
will
be
obtained
by
matching
the
correct
speed
with
a
steady
feed
pressure
that
lets
the
tool
cut
easily
at
an
even
rate
.

Fly
cutters
can
fool
you
into
putting
your
hand
too
close
to
the
tool
,
so
if
you
want
to
avoid
nicked
fingers
,
keep
your
hands
well
out
of
the
way
.

The
depth
gauge
rod
can
now
be
set
,
and
any
number
of
holes
bored
to
exact
and
identical
depth
.

The
whole
length
of
Essex
bridge
is
one
thousand
and
thirty
feet
and
its
breadth
thirty-four
.

As
Mr.
Palmer
was
educated
to
house-building
only
,
and
had
never
seen
a
structure
of
this
nature
;
;

It
is
hardly
necessary
to
remind
students
of
covered
bridges
that
Timothy
Palmer
was
born
in
1751
in
nearby
Rowley
;
;

A
brief
description
accompanying
the
picture
says
that
the
bridge
contained
more
than
6000
tons
of
timber
.

It
is
said
that
the
eccentric
Timothy
Dexter
,
who
was
one
of
the
first
share-holders
,
stood
on
the
table
and
made
a
speech
worthy
of
the
occasion
.

In
spite
of
this
catastrophe
,
the
bridge
was
rebuilt
on
the
same
plan
and
opened
again
on
July
17
,
1827
.

This
second
chain
bridge
was
570
feet
long
,
had
two
thirty-foot
towers
and
a
draw
,
and
a
double
roadway
.

Colonel
Frederick
W.
Lander
,
impersonated
,
will
again
make
his
break-neck
ride
down
the
steep
declivity
of
Talbott's
(
now
College
)
Hill
and
thunder
across
the
bridge
to
join
Colonel
Benjamin
F.
Kelley's
(
West
)
Virginia
Infantry
,
then
swarming
through
the
streets
in
pursuit
of
the
retreating
Confederates
.

He
was
closely
followed
by
the
Ohio
and
Indiana
troops
--
thus
the
old
bridge
has
another
distinction
;
;

Twice
during
the
Civil
War
it
was
saved
from
destruction
by
the
opposing
armies
by
the
pleas
and
prayers
of
a
local
minister
.

It
still
stands
as
a
monument
to
the
engineering
skills
of
the
last
century
and
still
serves
in
the
gasoline
age
to
carry
heavy
traffic
on
U.S.
Route
250
--
the
old
Beverly
and
Fairmont
Turnpike
.

It
is
one
of
the
very
few
,
if
not
the
only
surviving
bridge
of
its
type
to
serve
a
main
artery
of
the
U.S.
highway
system
,
thus
it
is
far
more
than
a
relic
of
the
horse
and
buggy
days
.

During
the
war
it
was
in
constant
use
by
the
wagon
trains
transporting
supplies
from
the
railhead
at
Grafton
to
the
troops
operating
in
the
interior
.

We
have
had
sound
grounding
in
the
principles
of
the
mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove
school
of
diplomacy
.

True
,
our
problems
have
lessened
a
bit
as
more
and
more
of
our
neighbors
have
built
their
own
pools
,
thereby
diluting
our
spectacular
attractions
.

But
problems
cling
to
pools
,
as
any
pool
owner
knows
.

Where
to
put
it

We
speak
from
varying
viewpoints
.

If
you
are
dreaming
of
a
blue
,
shimmering
pool
right
outside
your
living
room
windows
,
close
your
eyes
firmly
and
fill
in
the
picture
with
lots
and
lots
of
children
,
damp
towels
,
squashed
tubes
of
suntan
oil
and
semi-inflated
plastic
toys
.

You
can
also
see
that
the
greater
the
proximity
of
the
pool
to
your
main
living
quarters
,
the
greater
the
chance
for
violation
of
family
privacy
,
annoying
noise
and
the
let's-make-your-house-our-club
attitude
.

Naturally
it
will
be
dictated
to
a
large
extent
by
the
shape
and
size
of
your
land
.

Naive
of
us
,
maybe
,
but
the
results
of
our
impulsive
invitations
to
come
over
next
summer
and
swim
in
our
new
pool
were
both
unexpected
and
unsettling
.

Since
our
viewpoints
in
this
respect
coincided
precisely
,
we
present
the
fruits
of
our
efforts
herewith
as
a
single
social
code
for
pool
owners
.

We
designated
one
day
a
week
as
the
time
when
neighborhood
teen-agers
might
swim
at
definite
hours
.

We
gently
usher
them
to
an
island
of
tables
and
chairs
strategically
placed
on
the
far
side
of
the
pool
where
they
can
amuse
each
other
until
we
get
ready
to
merge
sides
.

All
dressing
(
undressing
to
be
more
exact
)
must
be
done
in
our
small
bath
house
or
at
the
swimmers'
homes
.

Diving
boards
must
have
non-skid
surfaces
(
coco
matting
takes
an
awful
beating
from
chlorine
and
rots
quickly
,
but
grit-impregnated
paints
are
excellent
)
.

Our
pools
also
have
wide
,
shallow
steps
--
for
the
benefit
of
the
littlest
swimmers
who
can
thus
be
introduced
to
the
water
with
far
greater
safety
than
a
ladder
affords
.

When
you
first
acquire
a
pool
,
we
earnestly
recommend
--
for
your
own
mental
health
--
a
good
long
chat
with
your
insurance
agent
.

As
the
pool
is
emptied
,
stand
by
to
brush
down
the
walls
and
bottom
while
they
are
still
wet
.

Do
not
forget
this
possibility
.

Once
on
the
water
,
these
little
visitors
seldom
leave
,
and
this
adds
to
your
filtering
and
vacuuming
problems
as
well
as
providing
a
slapping
good
time
for
all
those
present
.

Our
experience
has
taught
us
that
it
pays
to
buy
the
best
equipment
possible
,
from
pipes
to
brushes
.

Never
let
anyone
not
in
the
know
take
a
turn
at
the
valves
--
even
if
the
little
boys
do
want
to
play
space
ship
.

Even
if
you
live
above
that
line
,
the
FHA
will
back
you
,
for
they
have
decided
that
the
inclusion
of
air
conditioning
in
all
new
homes
is
a
good
thing
and
should
be
encouraged
.

Two
men
can
often
do
the
installation
in
a
day
.

We
know
now
that
a
15-degree
differential
in
temperature
is
the
maximum
usually
desirable
,
and
accurate
controls
assure
the
comfort
we
want
.

On
the
contrary
,
there
are
fewer
colds
and
smaller
doctor
bills
.

Control
of
temperature
and
humidity
is
a
godsend
to
the
aged
and
the
invalid
.

You
can
forget
about
screens
,
and
leave
the
storm
windows
up
all
year
around
.

The
equipment
won't
take
up
valuable
space
either
.

If
you
can't
see
your
way
clear
to
have
summer
cooling
included
when
building
,
by
all
means
make
provision
for
its
easy
adding
later
.

From
the
coil
small
copper
pipes
connect
to
a
weatherproof
refrigeration
section
set
in
the
yard
,
garage
,
carport
,
or
basement
.

The
minimum
cost
for
an
average
one-story
,
7-room
house
with
basement
,
is
likely
to
run
$1500
above
the
cost
of
the
heating
alone
.

In
a
long
,
rambling
ranch
,
two
such
units
can
be
installed
,
one
serving
the
living
area
,
the
other
the
sleeping
zone
.

One
of
the
more
remarkable
of
the
new
cooling
systems
is
one
that
can
be
switched
to
heating
.

Among
other
things
,
besides
the
nature
of
your
house
and
how
much
heat
finds
its
way
into
its
various
rooms
from
the
outside
,
it
will
depend
upon
your
personal
habits
and
the
makeup
of
your
family
.

The
body
is
a
heat
machine
,
and
20
to
25
guests
can
easily
double
your
cooling
load
.

A
ton
of
cooling
compares
to
the
cooling
you
get
by
melting
a
ton
of
ice
.

A
1-hp
conditioner
,
for
example
,
may
vary
in
effectiveness
from
under
8,000
BTU
to
well
over
10,000
Aj
.

The
safest
procedure
is
to
let
your
builder
estimate
the
size
of
the
unit
you
need
,
rather
than
trying
to
do
this
yourself
.

Reducing
humidity
is
often
as
important
as
cooling
.

The
more
directly
the
sun
strikes
walls
and
roof
,
the
greater
its
heat
impact
.

The
way
a
house
is
set
on
its
lot
can
therefore
influence
how
much
cooling
you
are
going
to
need
.

Insulate
,
weatherstrip
,
double-glaze
to
the
maximum
.

A
light-colored
roof
will
reduce
sun
heat
by
50
per
cent
.

Avoid
attic
placement
directly
above
a
bedroom
.

You
must
know
before
you
start
what
the
needs
and
objectives
of
your
organization
are
;

Most
counties
also
have
maps
available
from
the
county
engineer
showing
roads
and
other
features
and
from
the
assessor's
office
showing
ownerships
of
land
.

It
is
usually
helpful
to
make
a
sketch
map
in
the
field
,
showing
the
size
and
location
of
the
features
of
interest
and
to
take
photographs
at
the
site
.

County
judges
,
commissioners
,
engineers
,
assessors
,
and
others
who
have
lived
in
the
area
for
a
long
time
may
have
valuable
knowledge
regarding
the
site
or
opinions
to
offer
from
their
varied
professional
experiences
.

It
is
too
easy
for
the
inexperienced
person
to
make
a
quick
judgment
of
a
few
values
of
the
area
and
base
a
decision
on
these
alone
.

A
site
may
be
a
rundown
slum
or
a
desolate
piece
of
desert
in
appearance
today
but
have
excellent
potentials
for
the
future
with
a
little
development
or
water
.

The
same
is
true
of
areas
which
at
first
look
good
because
of
a
few
existing
recreation
features
but
may
actually
be
poor
areas
to
develop
for
general
public
use
.

Naturally
,
a
park
site
with
scenic
views
,
a
good
lake
,
trees
,
and
sand
dunes
,
will
attract
more
people
than
a
nearby
area
with
only
trees
and
dunes
.

Frontage
on
a
body
of
clear
,
clean
water
will
be
vastly
different
from
the
same
amount
of
frontage
on
polluted
water
.

A
group
of
native
trees
or
plants
which
are
outstanding
in
a
particular
county
can
be
featured
at
the
site
.

The
site
may
be
on
one
of
the
major
flyways
of
migratory
birds
or
have
its
own
resident
bird
life
.

The
historical
sign
tells
its
story
,
but
nothing
gets
interest
across
as
well
as
some
of
the
original
historical
items
or
places
themselves
which
still
have
the
character
of
the
period
covered
.

Those
which
tell
a
story
of
the
earth's
formation
in
each
area
can
add
geological
interest
to
the
recreation
sites
.

An
old
shipwreck
,
a
high
dam
,
an
old
covered
bridge
,
a
place
to
find
agates
or
other
semi-precious
stones
or
a
place
to
pan
gold
,
etcetera
may
be
of
interest
.

Some
areas
may
provide
archeological
values
such
as
ancient
Indian
village
sites
or
hunting
areas
,
caves
,
artifacts
,
etcetera
.

Many
things
need
to
be
checked
:

--
The
size
of
the
area
alone
can
be
a
determining
factor
.

--
The
values
of
the
site
may
be
affected
by
the
appearance
of
the
adjoining
lands
,
ownership
and
use
of
the
land
,
and
the
utilities
available
there
.

The
utilities
available
nearby
may
provide
a
savings
in
the
cost
of
extending
electricity
or
water
to
the
site
.

Check
the
elevation
of
the
ground
,
degree
and
direction
of
slopes
,
drainage
,
rock
outcrops
,
topsoil
types
and
quality
,
as
well
as
subsoil
.

Nearly
level
areas
are
required
for
parking
areas
,
beaches
,
camp
areas
,
ballfields
,
etcetera
.

--
The
existing
plant
growth
calls
for
thorough
checking
.

An
area
may
have
been
partially
logged
and
requires
removal
of
stumps
or
clean-up
.

Some
shrubs
may
be
of
good
landscaping
value
,
other
areas
of
brush
may
need
to
be
cleared
.

--
Some
areas
may
already
have
been
improved
and
contain
buildings
,
roads
,
utilities
,
cleared
land
,
etcetera
which
may
raise
the
cost
of
the
site
.

and
with
sober
purpose
,
because
the
development
of
Prokofieff
personifies
,
in
many
ways
,
the
course
of
music
in
the
Union
of
Soviet
Socialist
Republics
.

A
tongue-in-cheek
stylization
of
18th-Century
ideas
;
;

His
life-long
friend
,
Serge
Koussevitzky
,
gave
unreservedly
of
his
praise
and
brilliant
performances
in
Boston
,
New
York
,
and
Washington
,
D.C.
,
,
to
which
he
added
broadcastings
and
recordings
for
the
whole
nation
.

Uncle
Sam
was
,
indeed
,
a
rich
uncle
to
Prokofieff
,
in
those
opulent
,
post-war
victory
years
of
peace
and
prosperity
,
bold
speculations
and
extravaganzas
,
enjoyment
and
pleasure
:
The
Golden
Twenties
.

We
unanimously
agreed
that
Prokofieff
had
won
his
rights
as
a
world
citizen
to
the
first
ranks
of
Twentieth-Century
Composers
.

The
world
exploded
when
Fascism
challenged
all
concepts
of
peace
and
liberty
,
and
the
outraged
,
freedom-loving
peoples
of
the
Capitalist
and
Socialist
worlds
combined
forces
to
stamp
Fascist
tyranny
into
cringing
submission
.

But
no
:
Prokofieff
grew
.

Of
course
,
these
works
are
not
comparable
,
even
though
the
same
brain
conceived
them
.

The
early
works
were
conceived
for
a
sophisticated
,
international
audience
;
;

However
,
in
all
of
Prokofieff's
music
,
young
or
mature
,
we
find
his
profile
--
his
signature
--
his
craftsman's
attitude
.

Also
,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
polytonal
freedom
of
his
melodies
and
harmonic
modulations
,
the
brilliant
orchestrations
,
the
adroitness
for
evading
the
heaviness
of
figured
bass
,
the
skill
in
florid
counterpoint
were
not
lost
in
his
mature
output
,
even
in
the
spectacular
historical
dramas
of
the
stage
and
cinema
,
where
a
large
,
dramatic
canvas
of
sound
was
required
.

So
Prokofieff
was
able
to
cultivate
his
musical
talents
and
harvest
a
rich
reward
from
them
.

Nor
can
anyone
be
certain
that
Prokofieff
would
have
done
better
,
or
even
as
well
,
under
different
circumstances
.

I
think
the
answer
is
to
be
found
in
Prokofieff's
own
words
:
the
clarity
must
be
new
,
not
old
.

Prokofieff
was
guided
in
a
consistent
direction
by
the
life
of
his
own
people
--
by
the
compass
of
their
national
ideas
.

Because
of
the
authentic
homogeneity
of
his
early
Nationalistic
materials
,
and
his
flair
for
orchestrations
--
his
brilliant
Petruchka
,
his
savage
Sacre
Du
Printemps
,
his
incisive
Les
Noces
--
the
world
kept
hoping
that
he
could
recapture
the
historical
direction
for
which
his
native
talents
were
predisposed
.

What
a
patchwork
of
proclamations
and
renunciations
!
!

Meager
and
shabby
by-products
linger
to
haunt
our
memories
of
a
once
mighty
protagonist
;
;

a
poor
attempt
to
write
an
idiomatic
jazz
concerto
;
;

a
circus
polka
for
elephants
;
;

That
his
moods
,
even
in
his
early
years
,
are
those
of
his
people
,
does
him
honor
,
as
his
music
honors
those
who
inspired
it
.

April
10
marked
a
memorable
date
in
New
York's
musical
history
--
indeed
in
the
musical
history
of
the
entire
eastern
United
States
.

It
has
been
my
privilege
to
paint
with
Roy
Mason
on
numerous
occasions
,
mostly
in
the
vicinity
of
Batavia
.

color
patterns
that
are
made
to
weave
throughout
the
whole
composition
;
;

instructive
--
maybe
;
;

But
for
the
technical
fact
,
we
have
the
artist's
own
testimony
:

For
me
,
these
will
belong
more
completely
to
their
surroundings
if
they
are
conceived
in
this
early
stage
,
though
I
freely
admit
that
I
do
not
hesitate
to
add
or
eliminate
figures
on
the
full
sheet
when
it
serves
my
final
purpose
.

If
the
artist
would
study
his
work
more
thoroughly
and
move
certain
units
in
his
design
,
often
only
slightly
,
finer
pictures
would
result
.

When
this
occurs
,
I
make
the
change
on
the
sketch
or
on
the
final
watercolor
--
if
I
have
been
working
on
a
full
sheet
in
the
field
.

As
for
materials
,
I
use
the
best
available
.

I
work
on
a
watercolor
easel
in
the
field
,
and
frequently
resort
to
a
large
garden
umbrella
to
protect
my
eyes
from
undue
strain
.

I
have
used
a
variety
of
heavy-weight
hand-made
papers
,
but
prefer
an
English
make
,
rough
surface
,
in
400-pound
weight
.

After
selecting
a
sheet
and
inspecting
it
for
flaws
(
even
the
best
sometimes
has
foreign
'
nubbins
'
on
its
surface
)
,
I
sponge
it
thoroughly
on
both
sides
with
clean
,
cold
water
.

My
brushes
are
different
from
those
used
by
most
watercolorists
,
for
I
combine
the
sable
and
the
bristle
.

In
analyzing
the
watercolors
of
Roy
Mason
,
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
their
essential
decorativeness
,
yet
this
word
has
such
a
varied
connotation
that
it
needs
some
elaboration
here
.

True
,
a
Mason
watercolor
is
unmistakably
a
synthesis
of
nature
rather
than
a
detailed
inventory
.

Unlike
many
decorative
patterns
that
present
a
static
flat
convention
,
this
artist's
pictures
are
full
of
atmosphere
and
climate
.

When
painting
,
Mason's
physical
eyes
are
half-closed
,
while
his
mind's
eye
is
wide
open
,
and
this
circumstance
accounts
in
part
for
the
impression
he
wishes
to
convey
.

two
American
Watercolor
Society
prizes
;
;

The
Russians
are
all
trained
as
dancers
before
they
start
to
study
gymnastics
.

And
is
the
sport
really
important
?
?

But
if
it
is
important
,
what
can
we
do
to
improve
ourselves
?
?

The
parallel
bars
,
horse
,
buck
,
springboard
,
horizontal
bar
,
rings
,
and
mats
formerly
in
the
school
gyms
were
replaced
by
baseball
,
volleyball
,
basketball
and
football
.

But
the
Russians
use
gymnastics
as
the
first
step
in
training
for
all
other
sports
because
it
provides
training
in
every
basic
quality
except
one
,
endurance
.

(
An
enterprising
teacher
or
parent
could
start
training
a
healthy
child
at
the
age
of
seven
days
.

)
In
most
sports
,
as
in
most
walks
of
life
,
the
angels
are
on
the
side
of
those
who
begin
young
,
and
the
Russian
competitor
of
16
has
at
least
thirteen
years
of
training
behind
him
.

The
American
is
very
lucky
if
he
has
three
.

They
saw
completely
masculine
and
obviously
virile
men
performing
with
incredible
grace
.

They
were
further
stripped
of
old
wive's
tales
by
seeing
the
slender
,
lovely
Russian
girls
performing
feats
requiring
tremendous
strength
and
with
not
one
bulging
muscle
.

Dancers
do
have
flexibility
.

Ask
any
group
of
ballerinas
to
do
ten
push-ups
or
three
chin-ups
and
the
results
,
considering
the
amount
of
physical
training
they
have
had
,
will
be
very
disappointing
.

For
arm
and
shoulder
strength
a
chinning
bar
is
recommended
.

Push-ups
are
essential
,
but
few
have
the
strength
for
them
at
first
.

Push
back
up
and
repeat
.

Do
this
exercise
six
times
each
class
period
.

At
first
each
child
should
do
a
kick-up
by
himself
so
that
the
teacher
can
determine
those
ready
to
work
alone
,
and
those
who
need
help
.

This
will
prevent
flat
falls
and
toe
injuries
.

Be
sure
that
the
landing
foot
is
brought
close
to
the
hands
and
that
only
one
foot
lands
at
a
time
.

Place
flat
palms
on
either
side
of
the
head
a
few
inches
away
from
the
ears
,
fingers
pointing
toward
the
shoulders
.

By
lifting
the
seat
upwards
a
little
,
the
weight
is
taken
off
the
neck
and
the
back
is
kept
rounded
.

And
dancing
school
,
so
helpful
in
artistic
and
psychological
development
,
also
contributes
to
this
essential
early
training
--
and
can
contribute
even
more
.

The
author
has
recently
studied
the
field
of
medical
electronics
and
has
been
convinced
that
,
in
this
area
alone
,
the
application
of
electronic
equipment
has
enormous
possibilities
.

This
stain
often
disrupts
the
normal
cell
activity
or
else
colors
only
the
outside
.

A
completely
new
insight
into
living
cells
and
their
structure
will
be
possible
by
use
of
a
new
technique
which
replaces
visible
light
with
ultraviolet
radiation
and
combines
a
microscope
with
a
color-TV
system
to
view
the
results
.

Fig.
1
is
a
simplified
block
diagram
of
the
ultraviolet
microscopy
system
developed
at
the
Medical
Electronics
Center
of
Rockefeller
Institute
.

These
wavelengths
are
reflected
in
sequence
through
the
specimen
by
the
rotating
mirror
;
;

At
the
University
of
Washington
Medical
School
,
the
electronics
group
has
developed
the
Respiratory
Gas
Analyzer
shown
in
Fig.
3
.

Usually
the
patient
breathes
into
a
mouthpiece
while
walking
a
treadmill
,
standing
still
,
or
in
some
other
medically
significant
position
.

For
many
of
these
measurements
the
chest
must
be
opened
,
but
the
blood
vessels
and
the
heart
itself
remain
undisturbed
.

The
travel
time
of
sound
in
tissue
is
about
1500
meters
per
second
;
;

thus
it
takes
about
16
Msec.
to
traverse
25
mm.
of
tissue
.

A
simplified
version
of
the
instrumentation
for
this
procedure
is
shown
in
Fig.

.

One
of
the
advantages
of
this
method
is
that
the
pill
can
remain
in
the
patient
for
several
days
,
permitting
observation
under
natural
conditions
.

One
of
the
most
gratifying
applications
of
an
important
technique
of
submarine
detection
is
in
the
exploration
of
the
human
body
.

Our
readers
are
familiar
with
the
principles
of
sonar
where
sound
waves
are
sent
out
in
water
and
the
echoes
then
indicate
submerged
objects
.

Because
the
body
contains
so
much
liquid
,
transmission
of
ultrasonic
signals
proceeds
fairly
well
in
muscles
and
blood
vessels
.

Based
on
this
phenomenon
,
a
number
of
investigators
have
used
this
method
to
look
through
human
organs
.

He
can
diagnose
detachment
of
the
retina
where
conventional
methods
indicate
blindness
due
to
glaucoma
.

A

eye

together
with
a
description
of
the

,
is

Oersted's
boyhood
represented
a
minimal
chance
of
either
attaining
greatness
or
serving
his
people
so
well
and
over
so
long
a
span
of
life
.

his
wife
taught
the
two
boys
to
read
and
write
Danish
.

From
the
town
surveyor
,
Hans
learned
drawing
and
mathematics
and
,
from
a
university
student
,
some
academic
subjects
.

They
supplemented
their
income
by
small
government
assistance
,
by
tutoring
and
economizing
wherever
they
could
.

He
proposed
a
fresh
theory
of
alkalis
which
later
was
accepted
in
chemical
practices
.

Hans'
student
days
were
at
a
time
when
Europe
was
in
a
new
intellectual
ferment
following
the
revolutions
in
America
and
in
France
,
Germany
and
Italy
were
rising
from
divisive
nationalisms
and
a
strong
wave
of
intellectual
awareness
was
sweeping
the
Continent
.

The
following
year
he
devoted
to
the
customary
Wanderjahr
,
traveling
in
Germany
,
France
,
and
the
Netherlands
,
meeting
the
philosophers
Schelling
,
Fichte
,
and
Tieck
.

In
May
,
1803
,
Ritter
,
in
another
flight
of
fancy
,
wrote
to
Oersted
a
letter
that
contained
a
remarkable
prophecy
.

Thus
,
1745
corresponded
to
the
invention
of
the
Leiden
jar
by
Kleist
,
1764
that
of
the
electrophorus
by
Wilcke
,
1782
produced
the
condenser
of
Volta
,
and
1801
the
voltaic
pile
.

Ritter
proceeded
,
You
now
emerge
into
a
new
epoch
in
which
late
in
the
year
1819
or
1820
,
you
will
have
to
reckon
.

Manthey
maintained
a
valuable
collection
of
physical
and
chemical
apparatus
which
was
at
Oersted's
disposal
during
and
after
his
graduation
.

In
Berlin
he
published
his
views
of
the
chemical
laws
of
nature
in
German
and
this
was
issued
in
French
translation
(
Paris
,
1813
)
under
the
title
Recherches
Sur
l'identite
Des
Forces
chimiques
et
electriques
,
a
work
held
in
very
high
esteem
by
the
new
generation
of
research
chemists
.

His
interest
in
finding
a
relationship
between
voltaic
electricity
and
magnetism
is
here
first
indicated
.

An
attempt
should
be
made
to
see
if
electricity
,
in
its
most
latent
stage
,
has
any
action
on
the
magnet
as
such
.

In
one
debate
he
supported
the
freedom
of
judgment
as
opposed
to
dogma
,
in
another
he
held
that
the
practice
of
science
was
in
fact
an
act
of
religious
worship
.

Beccaria
had
almost
stumbled
on
a
lead
to
the
relationship
between
electricity
and
magnetism
when
a
discharge
from
a
Leyden
jar
was
sent
transversally
through
a
piece
of
watch-spring
steel
making
its
ends
magnetic
.

The
experiments
of
Romagnosi
and
others
have
already
been
noted
but
no
one
had
determined
the
cause-and-effect
relationship
between
these
two
primary
forces
.

At
this
lecture
Oersted
happened
to
place
the
conducting
wire
over
and
parallel
to
a
magnetic
needle
.

Additive
should

Feed
is
put
in
with
an
elevator
.

Filling
these
bunks
by
the
same
self-unloading
wagons
used
to
fill
silos
spreads
cost
of
the
wagons
over
more
time
and
operations
.

There
has
been
an
intensification
of
price-consciousness
in
recent
years
;
;

there
is
every
indication
it
will
continue
.

Despite
generally
good
levels
of
income
,
we
see
greater
price
pressures
than
ever
before
--
traveling
back
along
the
chain
from
consumer
to
distributor
to
manufacturer
.

Have
you
actually
checked
out
(
not
just
mentally
tested
)
different
selling
approaches
designed
to
counter
the
price
competition
problem
?
?

Average
consumer
is
becoming
more
sophisticated
regarding
product
and
advertising
claims
,
partly
because
of
widespread
criticism
of
such
assertions
.

We
have
already
witnessed
great
changes
through
mergers
and
acquisitions
in
the
food
industry
--
at
both
the
manufacturing
and
retail
ends
.

Problems
in
marketing
methods

Moreover
,
the
larger
and
more
aggressive
mass
distribution
outlets
and
chain
stores
have
insisted
on
high
quality
--
and
the
customer
seems
to
have
caught
on
.

It
has
multiple
implications
and
possible
headaches
for
your
marketing
program
.

How
can
you
cash
in
on
this
fast-growing
type
of
outlet
and
still
maintain
relationships
with
older
existing
outlets
which
are
still
important
?
?

Will
you
be
out
in
the
market
place
with
some
of
these
sales-building
new
products
?
?

and
translate
the
whole
into
profit
and
loss
and
balance
sheet
figures
which
management
can
act
on
with
some
assurance
?
?

Nor
has
the
training
been
enough
in
relation
to
the
need
.

Have
you
estimated
your
sales
manpower
needs
for
the
future
(
both
quantitatively
and
qualitatively
)
?
?

If
companies
will
take
the
time
to
give
objective
consideration
to
their
major
problems
and
to
the
questions
they
provoke
,
then
a
long
constructive
step
will
have
been
taken
toward
more
effective
marketing
in
next
decade
.

We
may
then
dismiss
the
time
difference
between
these
courses
and
the
usual
four
year
course
of
the
interior
design
student
as
not
having
serious
bearing
on
the
subject
.

One
or
two
of
the
schools
have
a
five
year
curriculum
,
but
the
usual
pattern
of
American
education
has
limited
most
of
them
to
the
four-year
plan
which
seems
to
be
the
minimum
in
acceptable
institutions
.

In
addition
to
this
the
U.
S.
Civil
Service
Bureau
,
when
examining
applicants
for
government
positions
as
interior
designers
,
expects
that
when
various
needed
objects
are
not
obtainable
on
the
market
he
will
design
them
.

And
further
he
must
understand
his
obligation
to
the
client
to
not
only
meet
his
physical
necessities
but
also
to
enhance
and
improve
his
life
and
to
enlarge
the
cultural
horizon
of
our
society
.

Yet
even
here
many
a
problem
is
presented
;
;

as
in
a
recent
design
competition
with
a
floor
plan
and
the
simple
command
--
design
a
luxury
apartment
;
;

In
the
earlier
years
of
training
certain
phases
of
the
work
must
be
covered
and
the
synthetic
problem
has
its
use
.

Certainly
every
educator
involved
in
interior
design
should
be
a
member
and
active
in
the
work
of
one
of
these
organizations
.

Participation
for
the
educator
in
this
case
,
however
,
would
have
to
be
raised
to
full
and
complete
membership
.

The
professor
in
turn
dares
not
tolerate
the
influence
in
his
classes
of
an
organization
in
the
policies
and
standards
of
which
he
has
no
voice
.

In
one
way
the
Institutes
and
Societies
do
a
disservice
to
the
schools
.

When
these
groups
were
first
formed
many
prominent
and
accomplished
decorators
could
not
have
had
the
advantage
of
school
training
since
interior
design
courses
were
rare
and
undeveloped
during
their
youth
.

No
one
can
deny
that
these
back
door
admissions
to
membership
provisions
have
been
seriously
abused
nor
that
they
have
not
resulted
in
the
admission
of
downright
incompetents
to
membership
in
supposedly
learned
societies
.

Beyond
any
question
of
curriculum
and
approach
to
subject
must
be
the
quality
of
the
teachers
themselves
.

Only
a
few
years
ago
a
middle
western
college
circulated
a
request
for
a
teacher
of
interior
design
.

It
has
been
the
custom
for
most
universities
to
stretch
the
blanket
of
accreditation
for
their
liberal
arts
school
to
cover
the
shivering
body
of
their
fine
arts
department
.

Do
you
measure
its
relation
to
reduced
absenteeism
,
turnover
,
accidents
,
and
grievances
,
and
to
improved
quality
and
output
?
?

Have
you
publicized
the
cents-per-hour
value
of
the
company's
share
of
insurance
premiums
?
?

When
did
you
last
compare
your
present
premium
costs
with
the
costs
of
insurance
from
other
sources
?
?

What
are
the
possibilities
for
operating
your
cafeteria
for
a
single
shift
only
and
relying
upon
vending
machines
or
prepackaged
sandwiches
for
the
second-
and
third-shift
operations
?
?

Are
you
utilizing
cafeteria
space
for
company
meetings
or
discussions
?
?

Have
you
audited
your
program
recently
to
weed
out
those
phases
that
draw
least
participation
?
?

Are
you
spending
too
much
money
on
team
uniforms
that
benefit
only
a
few
employees
?
?

What
can
your
sales
and
purchasing
departments
do
to
curtail
orders
,
shipments
,
and
receipts
during
vacation
shutdown
periods
?
?

Can
you
share
medical
facilities
and
staff
with
neighboring
plants
?
?

Too
many
plant
officials
are
all
too
eager
to
buy
a
package
program
from
an
insurance
company
simply
because
it
works
for
another
plant
.

But
even
if
that
other
plant
employs
the
same
number
of
workers
and
makes
the
same
product
,
there
are
other
facts
to
consider
.

Are
you
in
a
rural
or
urban
area
?
?

They
are
asking
for
union
trouble
.

Encourage
them
to
exercise
their
benefits
.

Hallmark
Cards
,
Inc.
,
Kansas
City
,
Mo.
,
has
a
do-it-yourself
quiz
game
called
Benefit
Bafflers
,
which
it
distributes
to
employees
.

It
can
put
an
end
to
marginal
claims
which
play
havoc
with
your
insurance
rates
.

Also
,
reserve
the
right
to
demand
proof
of
death
despite
the
fact
that
you'll
probably
never
use
it
.

And
they
can
at
least
collect
the
money
they
put
in
,
plus
interest
,
when
they
leave
the
company
.

Consider
adopting
a
system
of
holidays
in
which
time
off
is
granted
with
an
eye
to
minimum
inconvenience
to
the
operation
of
the
plant
.

If
a
concessionaire
runs
the
cafeteria
,
keep
an
eye
out
for
quality
and
price
.

You'll
take
the
rap
.

Just
as
modern
transportation
has
outmoded
the
early
Studebaker
covered
wagon
,
the
demand
of
today's
sportsmen
and
women
has
necessitated
changes
in
their
equipment
.

Personnel
assigned
through
the
shooting
development
program
have
proudly
participated
in
over
53
state
and
regional
workshops
,
at
which
hundreds
of
school
administrators
,
teachers
,
professors
,
and
recreational
leaders
have
been
introduced
to
Outdoor
Education
.

Help
is
needed
from
dealers
,
at
the
grass-roots
level
.

We
trust
that
you
,
as
a
gun
and
ammunition
dealer
,
have
benefited
through
additional
sales
of
equipment
.

Are
you
getting
top
dollar
from
the
shooting
sports
?
?

Are
you
looking
ahead
to
the
exploding
market
of
millions
of
American
boys
and
girls
,
who
will
grow
up
to
enjoy
a
traditional
American
way
of
life
--
ranging
the
fields
with
a
fine
American
gun
and
uniformly
excellent
ammunition
?
?

There
were
umbrella
tents
,

Pop

,
Baker

,

with

,
camper
trailers
,
travel
trailers
,
and
even
a
few
surplus
parachutes
serving
as
sunshades
over
entire
family
camps
.

Moving
around
camp
we
saw
all
kinds
of
camp
stoves
,
lanterns
,
coolers
,
bedding
,
games
,
fishing
tackle
,
windbreaks
and
sunshades
.

You
read
various
guesses
on
how
many
Americans
are
camping
.

Seven
million
families
would
total
30
million
Americans
or
more
.

What
does
the
camping
couple
do
to
this
set
of
figures
?
?

They
are
buying
fun
and
adventure
and
family
experiences
.

But
it
would
also
be
a
mistake
for
them
not
to
realize
how
comfortable
camping
has
become
.

But
there
is
still
the
sometimes
complex
problem
of
helping
campers
choose
the
best
equipment
for
their
individual
needs
.

Throughout
history
,
the
man
who
showed
superior
performance
has
become
the
commander
of
others
--
for
good
or
bad
.

Since
the
Industrial
Revolution
,
when
factories
emerged
,
this
classical
pattern
has
been
followed
.

and
much
more
commonly
in
recent
years
,
the
engineer
who
found
that
other
duties
interfered
with
--
or
eliminated
--
his
engineering
contributions
.

Some
men
have
no
talent
for
or
interest
in
management
;
;

Labor
fights
to
change
its
collar
from
blue
to
white
.

All
grades
of
management
seek
more
resounding
titles
and
incomes
because
of
social
pressures
.

usually
concerned
about
America's
belief
that
attainment
and
success
are
measured
in
dollars
and
titles
.

Yet
titles
are
traditionally
given
only
to
management
men
,
and
income
tends
to
rise
with
title
.

Advanced

Many
companies
have
systems
,
particularly
in
R
&
D
,
which
work
more
or
less
well
,
depending
upon
size
and
actual
belief
in
the
policy
on
the
part
of
administration
,
as
will
be
abundantly
apparent
in
subsequent
quotations
.

The
only
'
fellows
'
in
our
company
are
those
who
have
been
honored
by
ASME
,
AIEE
or
AIChE
.

I
am
sure
that
the
engineer
who
enters
management
is
nearly
always
opening
the
door
to
greater
possibilities
than
he
would
have
as
a
technical
specialist
--
because
of
his
wider
accountability
.

We
have
tried
to
make
both
paths
attractive
,
so
that
good
men
could
find
opportunity
and
satisfaction
in
either
.

One
way
to
formalize
this
is
in
the
job
structure
.

Above
these
jobs
we
have
chief
engineer
for
the
company
and
vice-president
of
Engrg
,
R
&
Aj
.

Approximately
four
years
ago
,
we
initiated
a
dual
ladder
of
advancement
for
technical
persons
.

and
an
administrative
organization
to
take
the
routine
load
away
from
department
managers
and
project
engineers
as
much
as
possible
,
thus
allowing
them
more
time
for
strictly
technical
work
.

These
are
only
halfway
measures
,
and
the
answer
will
come
when
some
way
is
found
to
allow
the
technical
man
in
industry
to
progress
without
limit
in
salary
and
prestige
.

The
highest
rated
non-supervisory
engineering
title
is
'
research
engineer
.

The
salary
schedule
permits
remuneration
greater
than
the
average
paid
to
the
first
level
of
engineering
supervision
(
engineering
section
head
)
.

We
also
have
an
'
engineering
section
head
--
research
engineer
'
classification
which
has
salary
possibilities
equivalent
to
that
of
a
research
engineer
.

All
scientific
staff
members
will
have
the
title
,
'
research-staff
member
.

Sixty
miles
north
of
New
York
City
where
the
wooded
hills
of
Dutchess
County
meet
the
broad
sweep
of
the
Hudson
River
there
is
a
new
home
development
called
Oakwood
Heights
.

As
a
matter
of
fact
you
could
probably
find
a
new
home
development
in
every
populated
county
in
the
country
with
three-bedroom
ranch
style
cottages
in
the
$14,000
range
.

Its
oil
for
heating
is
metered
monthly
to
each
home
from
a
line
that
starts
at
a
central
storage
point
.

Vice-president
is
Louis
Berkman
and
the
secretary-treasurer
is
Mark
Ritter
.

Rather
the
monthly
total
consumption
was
divided
and
charged
on
the
basis
of
number
of
rooms
and
persons
in
the
family
.

There's
an
advantage
in
having
a
firm
like
Tri-State
headed
by
a
lawyer
.

In
working
out
the
practical
legal
conclusions
President
Waters
was
not
thinking
only
of
this
pilot
project
,
for
it
is
planned
to
duplicate
this
program
or
system
in
other
builder
developments
nationally
.

This
first
test
is
being
leased
for
ten
years
but
future
projects
will
require
at
least
15
years
.

The
major
gets
the
assured
gallonage
for
the
life
of
the
lease
and
the
distributor
apparently
can
do
well
because
delivery
cost
is
low
.

They
like
it
and
would
supply
most
of
the
capital
because
of
the
long
term
leases
by
strong
oil
companies
.

The
meter
is
mounted
high
on
the
basement
wall
.

He
believes
that
this
is
a
sound
approach
to
gas
competition
in
builder
developments
where
gas
is
available
.

The
oilheating
industry
is
looking
up
,
led
by
a
revival
of
research
and
development
.

The
word
means
it
won't
boil
away
easily
,
nothing
else
.

If
a
lot
of
rust
shows
in
the
drain
,
use
a
good
flushing
cleaner
.

Then
fill
the
system
and
add
a
rust
inhibitor
.

Of
course
,
you'll
want
to
use
the
softest
water
you

in
your

Use
the

.

Don't
let
your
mechanics
pull
the
thermostats
out
of
those
fueloil
delivery
trucks
or
installation
rigs
of
yours
.

Evidence
of
this
trend
can
best
be
seen
in
the
recent
activities
of
such
leading
companies
in
the
field
as
Advance
Neon
Sign
Co.
,
Los
Angeles
,
Calif.
.

Out
of
many
factors
which
might
be
cited
,
five
are
most
important
:
1
.

Plastics
combine
such
properties
as
built-in
color
,
light
weight
,
optional
transparency
or
translucency
,
resistance
to
corrosion
,
as
well
as
the
ease
of
fabrication
.

Plastic
signs
are
economical
.

Pre-decoration
,
low-cost
molds
,
and
the
freedom
to
form
large
and
small
,
thick
and
thin
materials
make
plastics
tailor-made
for
the
industry
.

Internal
illumination
,
protected
from
the
elements
,
gives
them
powerful
visual
appeal
at
night
;
;

Of
interest
is
a
recent
announcement
by
Du
Pont's
Polychemicals
Dept.
of
a
new
methyl
methacrylate
monomer
designated
as
Monocite
H
100
,
which
was
developed
specifically
for
production
of
cast
acrylic
sheets
for
the
sign
and
lighting
industry
.

Sheeting
cast
from
this
material
reportedly
weighs
only
one-third
as
much
as
glass
,
is
impervious
to
all
kinds
of
weather
,
and
will
not
yellow
.

New
to
the
field
is
a
duplex
type
butyrate
laminate
in
which
the
two
sheets
of
the
laminate
are
of
different
color
.

A
relative
newcomer
in
outdoor
signs
is
Mylar
polyester
film
,
now
used
as
a
printed
overlay
for
trans-illuminated
signs
(
see
below
)
.

Here
may
be
found
regular
and
impact
styrene
,
cellulose
acetate
,
cellulose
butyrate
and
cellulose
propionate
,
acrylic
,
vinyl
,
expandable
styrene
foam
,
and
polyethylene
.

Spare
sets
of
face
panels
simplify
the
change
from
one
copy
or
message
to
another
;
;

new
panels
are
exchanged
for
the
old
right
in
the
field
on
a
single
trip
.

Panels
with
outdated
copy
are
returned
to
the
sign
shop
so
a
new
message
can
be
applied
.

Signs
of
this
type
have
already
made
their
appearance
in
several
larger
cities
,
and
others
are
on
the
way
.

As
used
by
Industrial
Electric
Inc.
,
the
film
panels
are
printed
one
at
a
time
,
as
are
24-sheet
posters
.

It's
a
lot
quicker
and
easier
to
dimension
the
kitchen
to
fit
the
cabinets
and
erect
the
end
wall
after
they
are
all
in
place
.

Finish
your
plumbing
before
you
frame
it
in
(
most
economical
framing
is
a
thin
non-bearing
partition
on
either
side
of
the
pipes
)
.

Don't
close
in
your
house
until
everything
has
been
carried
in
.

Instead
of
closing
the
house
in
first
(
as
most
builders
do
)
you
can
now
cut
your
costs
by
not
closing
it
in
until
you
have
to
(
see
p
121
)
.

The
revolution
now
under
way
in
materials
handling
makes
this
much
easier
.

That
House
&
Home
Round
Table
was
the
real
starting
point
for
today's
revolution
in
materials
handling
,
says
Clarence
Thompson
,
long
chairman
of
the
Lumber
Dealers'
Research
Council
.

Of
these
,
376
said
they
make
no
extra
charge
for
strapping
in
standard
units
,
because
they
save
enough
on
mechanized
carloading
to
offset
their
strapping
cost
.

The
railroads
have
responded
by
adding
20,000
more
box
cars
with
doors
12'
or
wider
for
forklift
unloading
(
a
21%
increase
while
the
total
number
of
box
cars
was
falling
6%
)
and
by
cutting
their
freight
rates
twice
on
lumber
shipped
in
heavily
loaded
cars
.

later
came
a
1961
cut
on
the
West
Coast
(
still
pending
elsewhere
)
of
on
70,000
lb-plus
carloads
(
which
works
out
to
more
than
on
that
portion
of
the
load
in
excess
of
70,000
lb
.

The
reason
:
today's
components
and
lumber
packages
are
far
too
bulky
to
be
handled
by
a
truckdriver
and
a
helper
.

It
cuts
the
lumber
dealer's
cost
because
it
takes
only
one
man
--
the
driver
--
to
unload
it
,
and
because
it
unloads
in
a
fraction
of
the
time
and
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
of
hand
unloading
.

And
it
helps
the
builder
because
it
can
handle
a
more
efficiently
packaged
load
,
can
deliver
it
to
the
best
spot
(
in
some
cases
,
right
on
the
roof
or
inside
the
house
)
,
and
never
takes
any
of
the
builder's
high-priced
labor
to
help
unload
it
.

Restudy
what
your
men
do
,
to
help
them
waste
less
of
the
time
you
pay
for

We
found
that
wherever
you
can
use
two
teams
on
a
job
,
five
men
,
not
four
,
is
the
magic
number
.

New
rule
no.

:
:

Don't
waste
any
$.10-a-minute
time
on
green
lumber
to
save
$.03
a
stud

But
now
that
all
production
builders
build
with
drywall
and
all
smart
builders
build
with
panels
,
green
lumber
is
an
anachronism
you
cannot
afford
.

So
if
a
green
stud
makes
a
carpenter
or
a
drywall
finisher
or
anybody
else
waste
even
20
seconds
,
the
green
stud
becomes
more
expensive
than
a
dry
stud
.

However
,
after
you've
seen
all
the
historical
piazzas
and
plazas
,
the
places
and
forums
,
the
churches
and
museums
,
the
palaces
and
castles
,
and
begin
to
feel
at
home
in
the
capitals
of
Europe
,
you'll
want
to
change
your
course
and
follow
the
by-roads
at
will
,
far
from
the
market
places
.

The
champagne
at
Troyes
,
the
traditional
capital
of
the
champagne
country
,
has
more
ambrosial
taste
somehow
than
it
has
at
a
sidewalk
cafe
on
the
Rue
de
la
Paix
or
at
Tour
D'Argent
.

For
those
who
need
or
want
and
can
afford
another
car
,
buying
one
and
driving
it
on
the
grand
tour
,
then
shipping
it
home
,
is
one
popular
plan
for
a
do-it-yourself
pilgrimage
.

The
answer
to
this
diathesis
is
to
pick
up
a
telephone
and
arrange
to
rent
one
.

Almost
any
travel
agent
will
reserve
a
car
for
you
.

You
can
call
one
of
the
car
rental
services
directly
(
Hertz
,
Avis
,
Auto-Europe
Nationalcar
Rental
,
and
others
)
and
ask
them
to
reserve
a
car
of
your
choice
,
and
some
transportation
lines
offer
this
service
as
well
.

Rental
fees
are
variable
,
too
,
throughout
the
countries
of
Europe
.

There
are
as
many
rates
as
there
are
countries
and
models
of
cars
available
.

There
is
the
free
intra-city
rent
it
here
,
leave
it
there
service
,
as
an
example
,
the
free
delivery
and
collection
at
the
airport
,
dockside
or
your
hotel
,
luggage
racks
,
touring
documents
and
information
and
other
similar
services
.

Quite
naturally
,
there
is
a
greater
availability
of
those
models
which
are
manufactured
within
a
specific
country
.

If
you
will
be
using
your
car
more
than
fifteen
days
,
which
isn't
all
unlikely
,
the
daily
rates
drop
quite
sharply
to
$.86
a
day
for
the
Fiat
500
and
to
an
infinitesimal
$.30
a
day
for
the
Fiat
2100
Station
Wagon
.

In
the
majority
of
countries
,
however
,
the
rates
range
from
$3.00
to
$3.50
a
day
for
the
smaller
sedans
and
graduate
up
to
$7.00
and
$8.00
a
day
for
the
larger
,
luxury
European
models
,
with
the
rate
per
kilometer
driven
starting
at
$.03
and
going
up
as
high
as
$.12
.

There
is
a
fairly
wide
selection
of
models
of
English
,
German
and
French
manufacture
from
which
you
can
choose
from
the
very
small
Austin
7
,
Citroen
2
CV
,
Volkswagens
,
Renaults
to
the
6-passenger
Simca
Beaulieu
.

After
the
first
month
,
rates
are
considerably
less
,
averaging
only
about
$60
a
month
for
most
4-
and
5-passenger
models
.

The
way
is
to
rent
a
chauffeur-driven
car
.

It
isn't
as
expensive
as
most
people
believe
it
to
be
.

The
big
spread
is
in
the
charge
for
each
kilometer
driven
,
being
governed
by
the
rate
at
which
gasoline
is
consumed
.

Since
most
European
cars
average
more
miles
per
gallon
of
gasoline
than
American
cars
,
it
naturally
follows
that
the
cost
per
kilometer
for
these
models
will
be
less
,
but
the
greater
seating
capacity
of
the
large
American
cars
will
equalize
this
,
provided
your
group
is
sufficiently
large
to
fill
a
7-passenger
limousine
.

Just
about
the
most
enthralling
real-life
example
of
meeting
cute
is
the
Charles
MacArthur-Helen
Hayes
saga
:
reputedly
all
he
did
was
give
her
a
handful
of
peanuts
,
but
he
said
simultaneously
,
I
wish
they
were
emeralds
.

Conclusions
:
The
people
involved
(
and
subsequent
facts
bear
me
out
here
)
knew
clearly
the
relative
values
of
peanuts
and
emeralds
,
both
monetary
and
sentimental
.

And
the
drawling
,
oversoft
voice
of
flirtation
,
though
fairly
overt
,
was
still
well
within
the
prescribed
gambit
of
their
culture
.

It
is
only
fairly
recently
,
however
,
that
linguists
have
developed
a
systematic
way
of
charting
voices
on
paper
in
a
way
that
tells
even
more
about
the
speakers
and
about
the
success
or
failure
of
human
communication
between
two
people
.

Since
interviewing
is
the
basic
therapeutic
and
diagnostic
instrument
of
modern
psychiatry
,
the
recording
of
interviews
for
playbacks
and
study
has
been
a
boost
of
Redstone
proportions
in
new
research
and
training
.

Some
of
the
earliest
recordings
,
made
in
the
1940's
demonstrated
that
psychiatrists
reacted
immediately
to
anger
and
anxiety
in
the
sound
track
,
whereas
written
records
of
the
same
interview
offered
far
fewer
cues
to
therapy
which
--
if
they
were
at
all
discernible
in
print
--
were
picked
up
only
by
the
most
skilled
and
sensitive
experts
.

Newest
to
this
high-powered
battery
are
the
experts
in
linguistics
who
have
carried
that
minimum
to
a
new
level
.

Interpretation
,
naturally
,
remains
the
role
of
the
therapist
,
but
orientation
--
not
only
the
patient's
vocal
giveaways
of
geographical
and
socio-economic
background
,
but
also
vocal
but
non-verbal
giveaways
of
danger
spots
in
his
relationship
to
people
--
can
be
considerably
beefed
up
by
the
linguist
.

His
esoteric
chartings
of
the
voice
alert
the
therapist
to
areas
where
deeper
probing
may
bring
to
light
underlying
psychological
difficulties
,
making
them
apparent
first
to
the
therapist
and
eventually
to
the
patient
.

The
patient
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
far
from
neutral
;
;

She
says
later
,
but
still
within
the
opening
five
minutes
,
I
keep
thinking
of
a
divorce
but
that's
another
emotional
death
.

The
phrase
,
emotional
death
,
interesting
and
,
to
a
non-scientific
mind
,
rather
touching
,
suggests
that
this
woman
may
have
some
flair
for
words
,
perhaps
even
something
of
the
temperament
regrettably
called
creative
.

Since
the
psychiatric
interview
,
like
any
other
interview
,
depends
on
communication
,
it
is
significant
to
note
that
the
therapist
in
this
interview
was
a
man
of
marked
skill
and
long
experience
.

When
someone
says
,
for
example
,
They
took
x-rays
to
see
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
me
,
it
pays
to
consider
how
this
statement
would
normally
be
made
.

)
Amateur
linguists
note
here
that
Pursewarden
,
in
Durrell's
Alexandria
Quartet
,
stammered
when
he
spoke
of
his
wife
,
which
is
hardly
surprising
in
view
of
their
disastrous
relationship
.

If
anyone
thought
of
the
John
Harvey
,
it
was
to
observe
that
she
was
straddled
by
a
pair
of
ships
heavily
laden
with
high
explosive
and
if
they
were
hit
the
John
Harvey
would
likely
be
blown
up
with
her
own
ammo
and
whatever
else
it
was
that
she
carried
.

Which
was
poison
gas
.

Throughout
the
early
years
of
World
War
2
,
,
reports
persisted
that
the
Axis
powers
had
used
gas
--
Germany
in
Russia
,
Japan
in
China
again
.

They
were
always
denied
.

Influential
people
in
America
were
warning
the
Pentagon
to
be
prepared
against
desperation
gas
attacks
by
the
Germans
in
future
campaigns
.

The
following
month
the
invasion
of
Italy
was
begun
,
and
Roosevelt
gave
effect
to
his
warning
by
consenting
to
the
stockpiling
of
poison
gas
in
southern
Italy
.

Thus
,
in
the
immemorial
way
--
in
the
way
of
the
right
hand
that
knows
and
the
left
that
does
not
--
was
the
stage
set
for
tragedy
at
Bari
.

It
was
the
night
of
December
2
,
1943
,
and
it
was
growing
dark
in
Bari
.

They
are
just
waiting
for
the
proper
time
to
come
over
here
and
dump
this
place
into
the
Adriatic
.

True
,
there
had
been
raids
on
Naples
--
but
Naples
was
pretty
far
north
on
the
opposite
coast
.

No
,
Bari
was
out
of
range
.

More
than
that
,
Allied
air
had
complete
superiority
in
the
Eighth
Army's
sector
.

So
Captain
Jenks
returned
to
his
harbor
post
to
watch
the
scouting
plane
put
in
five
more
appearances
,
and
to
feel
the
certainty
of
this
dread
rising
within
him
.

There
were
no
R.A.F.
fighter
squadrons
on
Bari
airfield
.

Not
fire
until
the
bombs
came
down
!
!

Ensign
Vesole
decided
that
he
would
not
tarry
until
he
heard
the
whispering
of
the
bombs
,
and
when
night
began
to
fall
,
he
put
Seaman
Donald
L.
Norton
and
Seaman
William
A.
Rochford
on
the
guns
and
told
them
to
start
shooting
the
moment
they
saw
an
enemy
silhouette
.

Below
decks
,
Seaman
Stanley
Bishop
had
begun
to
write
a
letter
home
.

There
were
lights
glinting
in
the
city
,
too
,
even
though
it
was
now
dark
enough
for
a
few
stars
to
become
visible
.

But
how
could
--
?
?

Unsinkable
slowed
and
stopped
,
hundreds
of
brilliant
white
flares
swayed
eerily
down
from
the
black
,
the
air
raid
sirens
ashore
rose
in
a
keening
shriek
,
the
anti-aircraft
guns
coughed
and
chattered
--
and
above
it
all
motors
roared
and
the
bombs
came
whispering
and
wailing
and
crashing
down
among
the
ships
at
anchor
at
Bari
.

They
had
come
from
airports
in
the
Balkans
,
these
hundred-odd
Junkers
88's
.

Merchant
ships
illuminated
in
the
light
of
the
flares
,
made
to
seem
like
stones
imbedded
in
a
lake
of
polished
mud
,
were
impossible
to
miss
.

Captain
Musmanno
roared
at
his
men
to
lash
three
of
the
casks
of
olive
oil
together
for
a
raft
.

He
was
wounded
,
but
fought
on
.

This
experience
will
have
happened
to
many
of
you
.

At
that
moment
Kipling
was
overwhelmed
with
awed
amazement
,
suddenly
recalling
that
these
identical
details
of
scene
,
action
and
word
had
occurred
to
him
in
a
dream
six
weeks
earlier
.

The
basic
mystery
of
dreams
,
which
embraces
all
the
others
and
challenges
us
from
even
the
most
common
typical
dream
,
is
in
the
fact
that
they
are
original
,
visual
continuities
.

I
recall
the
startling
,
vivid
realism
of
a
dream
in
which
I
lived
through
the
horror
of
the
bombing
of
a
little
Korean
town
.

Every
dream
,
and
this
is
true
of
a
mental
image
of
any
type
even
though
it
may
be
readily
interpreted
into
its
equivalent
of
wakeful
thought
,
is
a
psychic
phenomenon
for
which
no
explanation
is
available
.

But
these
are
dreamed
in
original
action
,
in
some
particular
continuity
which
we
don't
remember
having
seen
in
real
life
.

whereas
,
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
that
Smith
cannot
drive
a
car
.

The
entire
concept
of
cerebral
imagery
as
the
physical
basis
of
a
mental
image
can
find
no
logical
support
.

But
then
this
theory
confesses
that
it
is
completely
at
a
loss
as
to
how
the
image
can
possibly
be
received
by
the
brain
.

The
opening
paragraph
of
the
chapter
titled
The
Theory
Of
Representative
Perception
,
in
the
book
Philosophies
Of
Science
by
Albert
G.
Ramsperger
says
,
passed
on
to
the
brain
,
and
there
,
by
some
unexplained
process
,
it
causes
the
mind
to
have
a
perception
.

But
why
is
it
necessary
to
reproduce
the
retinal
image
within
the
brain
?
?

When
consciousness
deserts
the
sleeping
body
and
the
wakeful
world
,
it
continues
in
the
myriad
progressions
of
the
ever-present
past
and
future
,
in
a
life
as
vibrant
and
real
as
the
one
left
when
the
body
tired
and
required
sleep
.

As
a
matter
of
fact
,
the
incorrect
classification
,
the
result
of
many
weeks
of
labor
by
Dr.
Hilprecht
,
was
about
to
be
published
by
him
the
following
day
.

He
was
almost
positive
it
was
not
Assyrian
nor
Cassite
,
and
imagined
it
must
have
been
German
or
English
.

We
may
conclude
that
all
six
points
of
information
,
ostensibly
given
by
the
dream
priest
,
could
have
been
furnished
by
Dr.
Hilprecht's
subconscious
reasoning
.

That
the
perfect
continuity
was
composed
from
the
joblot
of
memory
impressions
in
the
professor's
brain
,
or
2
.

The
degree
of
circumstance
,
the
ratio
of
memory
to
forgetfulness
,
determines
whether
a
dream
will
be
a
recognized
,
fulfilled
prevision
,
or
the
vaguely
,
effective
source
of
the
weird
deja
vue
feeling
.

No
doubt
some
experiences
vanish
so
completely
as
to
leave
no
trace
on
the
sleeper's
mind
.

Probably
less
than
one
percent
of
our
previsions
escape
final
obliteration
before
we
wake
.

When
we
arrive
at
the
events
concerned
in
the
vanished
majority
,
they
,
of
course
,
cannot
impress
us
as
anything
familiar
.

If
Depew
had
told
any
academic
psychologist
that
he
had
a
weird
feeling
of
having
lived
through
that
identical
convention
session
at
some
time
in
the
past
,
he
would
have
been
informed
that
he
was
a
victim
of
deja
vue
.

Situated
in
a
region
of
some
of
the
loveliest
mountain
scenery
in
the
country
,
the
school
buildings
are
located
amid
open
fields
and
farm
lands
.

The
concept
of
good
nutrition
really
began
with
the
garden
.

The
school
has
always
maintained
a
farm
to
supply
the
needs
of
the
school
.

He
locked
his
equipment
in
a
cabinet
where
it
still
remains
.

All
these
materials
and
supplementary
manure
and
other
fertilizers
from
neighboring
dairy
and
poultry
farms
made
over
40
tons
of
finished
compost
a
year
.

The
carrots
sometimes
don't
make
it
through
the
winter
;
;

the
cabbage
and
squash
keep
until
March
or
April
.

A
new
project
planned
is
the
use
of
Bio-Dynamic
Starter
.

Of
course
they
learned
in
time
that
they
not
only
could
use
whole-wheat
bread
,
but
the
children
liked
it
better
.

Today
whole
grains
are
freshly
ground
every
day
and
baked
into
bread
.

The
school
has
not
used
cold
prepared
cereals
for
years
,
though
at
one
time
that
was
all
they
ever
served
.

Occasionally
,
the
children
find
steamed
,
whole-wheat
grains
for
cereal
which
they
call
buckshot
.

The
school
has
received
letters
from
parents
asking
,
What
happened
to
Johnny
?
?

Vegetables
are
served
liberally
.

Sometimes
sprouted
wheat
is
added
to
bread
and
causes
the
children
to
remark
,
Lillian
,
did
you
put
nuts
in
the
bread
today
?
?

Milk
appears
twice
a
day
.

The
school
raises
enough
poultry
,
pigs
,
and
beef
cattle
for
most
of
their
needs
.

The
source
is
known
so
there
is
no
necessity
to
remove
insecticide
residues
.

The
cooking
conserves
a
maximum
of
the
vitamin
C
content
of
vegetables
by
methods
which
use
very
little
water
and
cook
in
the
shortest
time
possible
.

Wholesome
snacks
,
no
candy

Since
Mr.
Clark
believes
firmly
that
the
chewing
of
hard
foods
helps
develop
healthy
gums
and
teeth
,
raw
vegetables
and
raw
whole-wheat
grains
are
handed
out
with
fresh
fruit
and
whole-wheat
cookies
at
snack
time
in
the
afternoons
.

Candy
is
not
allowed
.

Rugged
outdoor
exercise
for
an
hour
and
a
half
every
day
in
all
kinds
of
weather
was
the
rule
.

The
state's
railroad
system
counted
miles
of
broken
bridges
and
missing
rights-of-way
:
it
would
obviously
remain
out
of
commission
for
weeks
.

Over
in
Barre
the
streets
had
been
deep
in
swirling
water
,
and
bridges
were
crumpled
and
gone
.

They
had
courage
but
their
meager
training
consisted
of
weekend
hops
in
good
weather
,
in
and
out
of
established
airports
,
And
the
increasingly
cold
weather
soon
raised
hob
with
the
water
cooled
engines
of
their
World
War
1
,
planes
.

They
had
to
act
fast
,
for
letters
were
clogging
the
terminals
.

Piloting
a
Curtiss
Navy
MF
flying
boat
off
Lake
Winnipesaukee
in
1925
,
he
had
inaugurated
the
original
Rural
Delivery
air
service
in
America
.

It
took
a
tragedy
to
bring
things
to
a
head
.

As
a
wind
direction
indicator
,
they
tied
a
cotton
rag
to
a
sapling
.

The
airman's
stock
answer
to
Weren't
you
cold

?

As
daylight
began
to
show
through
the
frosty
windows
,
Fogg
would
place
a
call
to
William
A.
Shaw
at
the
U.
S.
Weather
Station
at
Northfield
,
Vermont
,
for
temperature
and
wind-velocity
readings
.

Shaw
could
also
give
the
flyer
a
pretty
good
idea
of
area
visibility
by
a
visual
check
of
the
mountains
to
be
seen
from
his
station
.

)
Wishing
to
show
that
aviation
was
dependable
and
here
to
stay
,
Bob
Fogg
always
made
a
point
of
taking
off
each
morning
on
the
dot
of
seven
,
disregarding
rain
,
snow
and
sleet
in
true
postal
tradition
.

Sometimes
,
on
a
return
trip
,
the
aviator
would
go
upstairs
high
over
the
clouds
.

At
the
end
of
the
calculated
time
he'd
nose
the
Waco
down
through
the
cloud
bank
and
hope
to
break
through
where
some
feature
of
the
winter
landscape
would
be
recognizable
.

Usually
back
in
Concord
by
noon
,
there
was
just
time
to
get
partially
thawed
out
,
refuel
,
and
grab
a
bit
of
Mrs.
Fogg's
hot
broth
before
starting
the
second
trip
.

At
a
nod
of
his
head
they
let
go
,
turning
to
cup
their
ears
against
the
icy
slipstream
.

If
so
,
are
you
saying
,
Where
did
the
last
few
years
go
?
?

You've
thought
about
it
before
in
a
hazy
sort
of
way
.

If
so
,
you
are
of
the
old
school
.

Actually
,
you
can
take
no
special
credit
for
this
.

You
had
your
day
and
it
was
a
good
day
.

Let
this
generation
have
theirs
.

Some
have
plenty
of
money
--
some
have
very
little
money
.

Some
are
blest
with
an
abundance
of
good
health
--
some
are
in
poor
health
and
many
are
invalids
.

Well
,
whatever
you
have
,
that's
it
!
!

Make
up
your
mind
to
pool
your
resources
and
get
the
most
out
of
your
remaining
years
of
life
.

Many
of
you
will
say
,
Well
,
what
can
I
do
?
?

There
are
many
,
many
things
to
do
.

Anyway
,
I'll
bet
you
have
a
lot
of
fun
.

Where
sewing
is
concerned
,
I
am
a
total
loss
.

Not
for
me
,
but
perhaps
just
the
thing
for
you
.

There
is
always
an
open
market
for
this
sort
of
delicacy
,
in
spite
of
low
calorie
diets
,
cottage
cheese
and
hands-off-all-sweets
to
the
contrary
.

Some
people
can
carve
most
anything
out
of
a
piece
of
wood
.

Outside
of
cutting
your
fingers
,
maybe
you
would
come
up
with
nothing
at
all
,
but
then
again
,
you
might
turn
out
some
dandy
little
gadgets
.

Some
women
get
a
real
thrill
out
of
housework
.

It
certainly
isn't
mine
.

I
can
look
at
furniture
in
one
spot
year
in
and
year
out
and
really
feel
for
sure
that's
where
it
belongs
.

This
gives
you
a
wide
and
varied
choice
.

Ever
since
I
was
a
child
,
I
have
always
had
a
yen
to
try
my
hand
at
writing
.

This
is
just
being
a
normal
writer
.

I
haven't
got
that
kind
of
money
.

How
about
a
rock
collection
,
or
a
collection
of
leaves
from
different
trees
or
shrubs
and
in
different
colors
?
?

Then
,
take
flowers
.

They
are
many
and
varied
.

Also
,
there's
scrap
books
,
collecting
newspaper
pictures
and
clippings
,
or
any
items
of
interest
to
you
.

What
does
it
mean
to
be
creative
,
a
term
we
hear
with
increasing
frequency
these
days
?
?

All
living
creatures
from
the
lowest
form
of
insect
or
animal
life
evidence
the
power
of
creativity
,
if
it
is
only
to
reproduce
a
form
like
their
own
.

An
animal
,
bird
or
insect
creates
either
a
burrow
,
or
nest
or
hive
in
unending
sameness
according
to
specie
.

In
fact
all
of
our
civilized
world
is
the
resultant
of
man's
projection
of
his
imagination
over
the
past
60
centuries
or
more
.

So
far
in
history
man
has
been
too
greatly
over-occupied
with
projecting
things
into
his
environment
rather
than
first
creating
the
sort
of
person
who
can
make
the
highest
use
of
the
things
he
has
created
.

Is
it
not
the
obligation
of
us
older
citizens
to
lend
our
weight
to
being
creative
on
the
character
side
and
to
hasten
our
own
maturing
process
?
?

That
is
,
locking
the
room
or
stateroom
door
gives
privacy
of
location
,
but
it
is
equally
important
to
be
sure
there
is
time
enough
for
an
utterly
unhurried
fulfillment
.

First
intercourse
for
the
bride
brings
with
it
the
various
problems
connected
with
virginity
and
the
hymen
.

(
Hymen
,
in
fact
,
is
the
Greek
word
for
membrane
.

Gynecologists
and
marriage
manuals
began
to
advise
that
the
bride
should
consult
a
physician
before
marriage
.

The
advantages
of
dilatation
by
the
physician
are
both
physical
and
psychological
.

In
this
process
the
vaginal
muscles
come
under
better
conscious
control
by
the
girl
.

It
is
far
better
to
have
such
conditions
treated
in
advance
than
to
have
them
show
up
on
the
honeymoon
where
they
can
create
a
really
serious
situation
.

But
during
the
same
examination
,
two
fingers
may
be
inserted
along
the
posterior
wall
(
the
bottom
of
the
vagina
in
the
same
position
)
without
any
pain
;
;

The
husband
and
wife
should
start
with
this
anatomical
information
clearly
in
mind
.

He
can
take
security
from
the
fact
that
the
progress
he
has
made
by
his
gentle
approach
will
not
be
lost
.

Too
many
new
things
are
happening
for
it
to
be
a
complete
erotic
fulfillment
.

It
is
ourselves
and
arouses
memories
of
all
the
things
we
wish
to
do
with
ourselves
.

Perhaps
this
is
a
clue
to
the
amazing
variety
and
power
of
reactions
,
attitudes
,
and
emotions
precipitated
by
the
nude
form
.

Whereas
persons
of
eighth
grade
education
or
less
were
more
apt
to
avoid
or
be
shocked
by
nudity
,
those
educated
beyond
the
eighth
grade
increasingly
welcomed
and
approved
nudity
in
sexual
relations
.

The
equally
ardent
proponent
of
freedom
from
any
kind
of
censorship
may
find
the
nude
human
form
the
natural
,
honest
,
free
expression
of
man's
spirit
and
the
epitome
of
beauty
and
inspiration
.

In
a
growing
number
of
American
homes
,
marriage
counselors
report
,
the
wife
is
taking
a
commanding
role
in
sexual
relationships
.

It
is
she
who
decides
the
time
,
the
place
,
the
surroundings
,
and
the
frequency
of
the
sexual
act
.

The
whole
act
is
tailored
to
her
pleasure
,
and
not
to
theirs
.

Yet
even
in
these
marriages
,
psychologists
say
,
wives
are
asserting
themselves
more
strongly
.

They
consider
it
simply
a
sign
of
our
times
.

Our
society
has
emancipated
the
woman
,
giving
her
new
independence
and
new
authority
.

Yet
many
psychologists
and
marriage
counselors
agree
that
domination
of
the
sex
relationship
by
one
partner
or
the
other
can
be
unhealthy
and
even
dangerous
.

On
the
other
hand
,
wifely
supremacy
demeans
the
husband
,
saps
his
self-respect
,
and
robs
him
of
his
masculinity
.

Caught
at
last
,
he
was
sentenced
to
prison
.

This
woman
repeatedly
complained
she
was
too
tired
for
marital
relations
.

After
every
money
argument
,
she
rebuffed
her
husband's
overtures
until
the
matter
was
settled
in
her
favor
.

The
wife
is
likely
to
be
young
,
sophisticated
,
smart
as
a
whip
--
often
a
girl
who
has
sacrificed
a
promising
career
for
marriage
.

The
husband
is
usually
a
well-educated
professional
,
preoccupied
with
his
job
--
often
an
organization
man
whose
motto
for
getting
ahead
is
:
Don't
rock
the
boat
.

Naturally
no
woman
can
ever
completely
monopolize
the
sexual
initiative
.

No
one
seriously
contends
,
of
course
,
that
the
domineering
wife
is
,
sexually
speaking
,
a
new
character
in
our
world
.

One
such
man
once
confided
to
Dr.
Theodor
Reik
,
New
York
psychiatrist
,
that
he
preferred
to
have
his
wife
the
sexual
aggressor
.

Wives
of
the
period
shamefacedly
thought
of
themselves
as
used
by
their
husbands
--
and
,
history
indicates
,
they
often
quite
literally
were
.

Very
few
wives
,
says
Dr.
Calderone
,
who
balance
the
checkbook
,
fix
the
car
,
choose
where
the
family
will
live
and
deal
with
the
tradesmen
,
are
suddenly
going
to
become
submissive
where
sex
is
concerned
.

A
woman
who
dominates
other
family
affairs
will
dominate
the
sexual
relationship
as
well
.

Marriage
manuals
and
women's
magazine
articles
began
to
stress
the
importance
of
the
female
climax
.

Often
she
fails
to
gain
sexual
satisfaction
.

One
such
wife
,
Dr.
Linden
says
,
became
disgusted
with
her
weak
husband
and
flurried
through
a
series
of
extramarital
affairs
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
stronger
man
.

But
her
personality
was
such
that
each
affair
lasted
only
until
that
lover
,
too
,
had
been
conquered
and
reduced
to
passivity
.

On
the
other
hand
,
a
husband
who
always
has
been
vigorous
and
assertive
may
suddenly
become
passive
--
asking
,
psychologists
say
,
for
reassurance
that
his
wife
still
finds
him
desirable
.

Other
experts
say
,
however
,
that
if
sexual
domination
by
one
or
the
other
partner
exists
for
longer
than
a
brief
period
,
it
is
likely
to
shake
the
marriage
.

She
was
still
in
the
play
for
pay
business
when
she
died
,
a
top
trollop
who
had
given
the
world's
oldest
profession
one
of
its
rare
flashes
of
glamour
.

(
Jelke
later
served
21
months
when
he
was
found
guilty
of
masterminding
a
ring
of
high-priced
call
girls
.

This
girl
is
the
Golden
Girl
of
cafe
society
.

She
lied
in
order
to
get
it
.

She
came
to
New
York
from
Detroit
as
a
teenager
,
but
with
a
sponsor
instead
of
a
chaperone
.

The
screen
test
was
never
made
--
but
Diane
was
.

Diane
loved
to
dance
in
the
nude
,
something
she
was
to
demonstrate
time
and
again
.

Even
among
the
fast
set
in
which
she
was
moving
,
her
method
for
keeping
an
escort
from
departing
too
early
was
unique
.

More
often
than
not
he
would
bow
to
the
inevitable
.

One
of
the
blonde's
yearnings
that
he
satisfied
was
for
travel
.

She
wanted
to
go
around
the
world
,
but
she
settled
for
a
French
holiday
.

And
in
short
order
the
croupier
had
pushed
several
million
francs
her
way
.

It
was
a
rugged
finish
for
what
must
have
been
a
very
interesting
night
.

The
hotel
staff
,
as
well
as
residents
of
the
Excelsior
,
told
us
they
saw
that
both
ladies
were
bleeding
from
scratches
as
they
were
seen
fleeing
down
the
hall
.

They
were
asked
to
leave
the
hotel
.

No
charges
were
filed
.

We
are
Americans
.

It
was
a
strange
relationship
.

Diane
spoke
no
Italian
or
French
.

No
believer
in
the
traditional
devotion
of
royal
servitors
,
the
plump
Pulley
broke
the
language
barrier
and
lured
her
to
Cairo
where
she
waited
for
nine
months
,
vainly
hoping
to
see
Farouk
.

When
Farouk
was
overthrown
,
police
picked
up
his
personal
pimp
,
Pulley
Bey
.

It
is
a
tribute
to
her
talents
that
she
was
able
to
talk
the
District
Attorney
into
having
her
removed
from
the
prison
to
a
hotel
room
,
with
her
meals
taken
at
Vesuvio's
,
an
excellent
Italian
restaurant
.

Newspapers
at
the
time
noted
that
the
move
indicated
that
she
was
co-operating
with
the
District
Attorney
.

When
the
police
arrived
,
they
found
McClellan
and
the
two
lawyers
sitting
and
staring
silently
.

Police
theorize
that
a
combination
of
dope
,
drink
and
drugs
killed
her
.

We
cater
mostly
to
nice
people
in
the
$5-8,000
annual
income
bracket
and
we
run
a
string
of
snazzy
,
neon-lit
,
chromium-plated
suburban
stores
.

There
is
only
one
trouble
with
this
big
,
beautiful
dream
.

Then
,
by
squeezing
her
foot
three
times
,
he
came
up
--
presto
--
with
a
different
diagnosis
with
each
squeeze
.

(
He
explained
that
he
could
diagnose
these
ailments
from
squeezing
her
foot
because
all
of
the
nervous
system
was
connected
to
it
.

The
human
body
--
he
pointed
out
,
for
example
--
required
33
units
of
blue
light
.

You
have
it
,
all
right
.

After
another
treatment
with
the
machine
,
he
told
her
that
her
entire
body
was
shot
through
with
tumors
and
cysts
.

The
sentence
:
360
days'
confinement
in
the
county
jail
.

With
these
gadgets
--
impressive
to
the
gullible
because
of
their
flashing
light
bulbs
,
ticks
,
and
buzzes
--
he
then
carries
out
a
vicious
medical
con
game
,
capitalizing
on
people's
respect
for
the
electrical
and
atomic
wonders
of
our
scientific
age
.

He
milks
the
latest
scientific
advances
,
translating
them
into
his
own
special
Buck
Rogers
vocabulary
to
huckster
his
fake
machines
as
a
cure-all
for
everything
from
hay
fever
to
sexual
impotence
and
cancer
.

He
may
call
himself
a
anaprapath
,
a
physiotherapist
,
an
electrotherapist
,
a
naturopath
,
a
sanipractor
,
a
medical
cultist
,
a
masseur
,
a
doctor
--
or
what
have
you
.

Authorities
believe
that
many
of
the
Doctor
Frauds
using
these
false
health
gadgets
are
still
in
business
.

Multiply
these
figures
by
the
millions
of
people
known
to
be
conned
by
medical
pirates
annually
.

That's
why
the
FDA
,
the
American
Medical
Association
(
AMA
)
,
and
the
National
Better
Business
Bureau
(
BBB
)
have
estimated
the
toll
of
mechanical
quackery
to
be
a
substantial
portion
of
the
$610
million
or
so
paid
to
medical
charlatans
annually
.

The
Postmaster
General
recently
reported
that
mail
order
frauds
--
among
which
fake
therapeutic
devices

prominently
--
are
at

highest
level
in
history
.

Similarly
,
the
American
Cancer
Society
(
ACS
)
,
the
Arthritis
and
Rheumatism
Foundation
,
and
the
BBB
have
each
stated
lately
that
medical
quackery
is
at
a
new
high
.

By
preying
on

,
by
playing
callously
on
the
hopes
of
the
desperate

by
causing
the
sufferer
to
delay
proper
medical
care
,
these
medical
ghouls
create
pain
and
misery
by
their
very
activity
.

Sarah
Gross
found
that
the
treatments
given
her
for
a
nervous
ailment
by
the
masseur
were
not
helping
her

Tom

it

Moreover
,
the
diabetic
patient
who
relies
on

quack
device
and
therefore
cuts
off
his
insulin
intake
can
be
committing
suicide

Small
wonder
a
Spokane

awarded
the

$35,823

Authorities
say

Then
one
day
Dick's
classmate
Jimmy
,
from
next
door
,
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
.

The
youngsters
in
the
boys'
class
had
nicknamed
Dick
Bugs
Bunny
because
his
teeth
protruded
.

When
Richard's
parents
told
him
they
wanted
to
take
him
to
an
orthodontist
--
a
dentist
who
specializes
in
realigning
teeth
and
jaws
--
their
young
son
was
interested
.

The
majority
of
children
in
the
United
States
could
benefit
by
some
form
of
orthodontic
treatment
,
says
Dr.
Allan
G.
Brodie
,
professor
and
head
of
the
department
of
orthodontics
at
the
University
of
Illinois
and
a
nationally
recognized
authority
in
his
field
.

A
child
probably
requires
some
form
of
treatment
if
he
has
any
of
the
following
conditions
:

A
noticeable
protrusion
of
the
upper
or
lower
jaw
.

Crooked
,
overlapping
,
twisted
,
or
widely
spaced
teeth
.

Front
teeth
not
meeting
when
the
back
teeth
close
.

Occasional
sucking
up
to
the
fifth
year
may
not
affect
a
youngster's
teeth
;
;

If
a
child
loses
a
molar
at
the
age
of
two
,
the
adjoining
teeth
may
shift
toward
the
empty
space
,
thus
narrowing
the
place
intended
for
the
permanent
ones
and
producing
a
jumble
.

In
certain
cases
,
as
in
Dick
Stewart's
,
a
child's
personality
is
affected
.

Yet
from
the
dentist's
point
of
view
,
bad-fitting
teeth
should
be
corrected
for
physical
reasons
.

Badly
placed
teeth
can
also
cause
such
a
speech
handicap
as
lisping
.

Next
Susie
will
enter
the
treatment
stage
and
visit
the
orthodontist
once
or
twice
a
month
,
depending
on
the
severity
of
her
condition
.

To
become
an
orthodontist
,
a
man
must
first
be
licensed
by
his
state
as
a
dentist
,
then
he
must
spend
at
least
two
years
in
additional
training
to
acquire
a
license
as
a
specialist
.

now
we
know
that
family
characteristics
do
affect
tooth
formation
to
a
large
extent
,
he
says
.

For
example
,
a
boy
may
inherit
a
small
jaw
from
one
ancestor
and
large
teeth
from
another
.

Now
a
dentist
can
recommend
extraction
immediately
.

Both
because
of
our
culture's
stress
on
beauty
and
our
improved
economic
conditions
,
some
parents
demand
that
the
dentist
try
to
correct
a
problem
before
it
is
wise
to
do
so
.

In
turn
the
other
teeth
are
likely
to
decay
because
food
particles
may
become
impacted
in
them
.

If
the
latter
knows
nothing
about
the
absent
sitter
except
his
name
(
given
by
the
experimenter
)
,
he
cannot
possibly
give
any
clues
,
conscious
or
unconscious
,
far
less
ask
leading
questions
.

that
fewer
women
are
named
Miranda
than
Elizabeth
;
;

So
,
after
the
sitting
has
been
held
,
several
readings
at
one
time
are
mailed
,
and
the
distant
sitter
(
whose
name
or
whose
communicator's
name
was
given
to
the
medium
)
must
mark
each
little
item
as

the

has
been
skimmed
off
,
and
the
items
in
the
successful
categories
separated
out

the
sitter
can
be
asked
to
consider
and
rate
only

concentrated

the
sensitive
is
at
her
best

Perhaps
this
is
not

extraordinary

details

it

noting
how

are
sometimes
obtained

can
cause
extra
work
that
must
be
caught
up

Production

fall
far
below
expectations
.

Returns
for
money
and
labor
invested
may
be
small
even
in

Land
within
commuting
distance
of
a
growing
city
is
usually
high
in
price
,
higher
if
it
has
subdivision
possibilities
.

If
the
farm
is
in
an
industrial
area
where
wages
are
high
,
farm
labor
costs
will
also
be
high

It
is
particularly
suitable
for
those
who
need
to
work
or
exercise
out
of
doors
for
their
health
.

Generally
,
the
same
level
of
living
costs
less
in
the
country
than
in
the
city
.

For
some
white-collar
workers
it
is
a
welcome
change
from
the
regular
job
,
and
a
physical
conditioner
.

It
depends
on
the
kind
and
the
scale
of
the
farming
operation
.

Counsel
for
the
defense
,
however
,
shrewdly
allowing
himself
to
be
swept
by
the
current
of
dreadful
recollections
,
rarely
raised
an
objection
.

Those
who
feared
emotionalism
at
the
Trial
showed
less
understanding
than
Dr.
Servatius
of
the
route
by
which
man
achieves
the
distance
necessary
for
fairness
toward
enemies
.

These
trials
were
properly
termed
political
cases
in
that
the
trial
itself
was
a
political
act
producing
political
consequences
.

But
what
could
the
Eichmann
Trial
initiate
?
?

It
is
not
an
individual
that
is
in
the
dock
at
this
historical
trial
--
said
Ben
Gurion
,
and
not
the
Nazi
regime
alone
--
but
anti-Semitism
throughout
history
.

In
such
a
case
the
defendant
should
serve
as
a
clear
example
and
not
have
to
be
tied
to
the
issue
by
argument
.

One
who
could
be
linked
to
anti-Semitism
only
by
overcoming
his
objections
is
scarcely
a
good
specimen
of
the
Jew-baiter
throughout
the
ages
.

but
he
believed
in
the
Jew-as-enemy
in
a
kind
of
abstract
,
theological
way
,
like
a
member
of
a
cult
speculating
on
the
nature
of
things
.

In
regard
to
Eichmann
,
it
was
to
be
found
in
the
Nazi
outlook
,
which
contained
a
principle
separate
from
and
far
worse
than
anti-Semitism
,
a
principle
by
which
the
poison
of
anti-Semitism
itself
was
made
more
virulent
.

The
Final
Solution
proved
that
the
Jew-baiter
of
any
variety
exposes
himself
as
being
implicated
in
the
criminality
and
madness
of
others
.

Ought
not
an
edifying
Trial
have
made
every
effort
to
demonstrate
this
once
and
for
all
by
showing
how
representative
types
of
mere
anti-Semites
were
drawn
step
by
step
into
the
program
of
skull-bashings
and
gassings
?
?

Nor
did
the
Trial
devote
much
attention
to
exposing
the
usefulness
of
anti-Semitism
to
the
Nazis
,
both
in
building
their
own
power
and
in
destroying
that
of
rival
organizations
and
states
.

once
in
power
he
begins
to
give
vent
to
a
criminal
opportunism
that
causes
him
to
alternate
between
megalomania
and
envy
of
those
above
him
.

The
Trial
should
have
asked
the
nations
.

As
the
first
collective
confrontation
of
the
Nazi
outrage
,
the
Trial
of
Eichmann
represents
a
recovery
of
the
Jews
from
the
shock
of
the
death
camps
,
a
recovery
that
took
fifteen
years
and
which
is
still
by
no
means
complete
(
though
let
no
one
believe
that
it
could
be
hastened
by
silence
)
.

It
is
already
difficult
to
recall
how
little
we
knew
before
the
Trial
of
what
had
been
done
to
the
Jews
of
Europe
.

most
of
the
information
elicited
in
Jerusalem
had
been
brought
to
the
surface
by
the
numerous
War
Crimes
tribunals
and
investigating
commissions
,
and
by
reports
,
memoirs
,
and
survivors'
accounts
.

In
Poughkeepsie
,
N.Y.
,
,
in
1952
,
a
Roman
Catholic
hospital
presented
seven
Protestant
physicians
with
an
ultimatum
to
quit
the
Planned
Parenthood
Federation
or
to
resign
from
the
hospital
staff
.

Three
agreed
,
but
four
declined
and
were
suspended
.

A
year
later
in
Albany
,
N.Y.
,
a
Roman
Catholic
hospital
barred
an
orthopedic
surgeon
because
of
his
connection
with
the
Planned
Parenthood
Association
.

These
incidents
,
typical
of
many
others
,
dramatize
the
distressing
fact
that
no
controversy
during
the
last
several
decades
has
caused
more
tension
,
rancor
and
strife
among
religious
groups
in
this
country
than
the
birth-control
issue
.

Instead
of
Catholics'
being
obliged
or
even
encouraged
to
beget
the
greatest
possible
number
of
offspring
,
as
many
Non-Catholics
imagine
,
the
ideal
of
responsible
parenthood
is
stressed
.

The
latter
plays
a
prominent
role
in
Roman
Catholic
theology
and
is
considered
decisive
,
entirely
apart
from
Scripture
,
in
determining
the
ethical
character
of
birth-prevention
methods
.

The
Roman
Catholic
natural-law
tradition
regards
as
self-evident
that
the
primary
objective
purpose
of
the
conjugal
act
is
procreation
and
that
the
fostering
of
the
mutual
love
of
the
spouses
is
the
secondary
and
subjective
end
.

Let
it
be
granted
then
that
the
theological
differences
in
this
area
between
Protestants
and
Roman
Catholics
appear
to
be
irreconcilable
.

Up
to
the
turn
of
the
century
,
contraception
was
condemned
by
all
Christian
churches
as
immoral
,
unnatural
and
contrary
to
divine
law
.

In
March

1931

22
out

28
members
of
a
committee
of
the
Federal
Council
of
Churches
ratified
artificial
methods
of
birth
control
.

There
is
general
agreement
also
that
sex
union
between
husbands
and
wives
as
an
expression
of
mutual
affection
without
relation
to
procreation
is
right
.

It
called
for
opposition
to
laws
and
institutional
practices
restricting
the
information
or
availability
of
contraceptives
.

The
general
board
declared
:
Most
of
the
Protestant
churches
hold
contraception
and
periodic
continence
to
be
morally
right
when
the
motives
are
right
.

For
all
concerned
with
social-welfare
legislation
,
the
significance
of
this
radical
and
revolutionary
change
in
the
thought
and
habits
of
the
vast
majority
of
the
American
people
is
clear
,
profound
and
far-reaching
.

She
carried
,
besides
her
captain
,
a
crew
of
twenty-one
and
provisions
for
a
voyage
of
exploration
of
the
Arctic
waters
of
North
America
.

Seventeen
months
later
,
on
September
6
,
1611
,
an
Irish
fishing
boat
sighted
the
Discovery
limping
eastward
outside
Galway
Bay
.

When
she
reached
port
,
she
was
found
to
have
on
board
only
eight
men
,
all
near
starvation
.

These
questions
have
remained
one
of
the
great
sea
mysteries
of
all
time
.

For
hundreds
of
years
,
the
evidence
available
consisted
of
(
1
)
the
captain's
fragmentary
journal
,
(
2
)
a
highly
prejudiced
account
by
one
of
the
survivors
,
(
3
)
a
note
found
in
a
dead
man's
desk
on
board
,
and
(
4
)
several
second-hand
reports
.

All
told
,
they
offered
a
highly
confused
picture
.

Historians
have
had
two
reasons
for
persisting
so
long
in
their
investigations
.

Twice
he
had
failed
,
and
the
Muscovy
Company
indicated
it
would
not
back
him
again
.

He
had
obtained
and
provisioned
a
veteran
ship
called
the
Discovery
and
had
recruited
a
crew
of
twenty-one
,
the
largest
he
had
ever
commanded
.

The
purpose
of
this
fourth
voyage
was
clear
.

But
there
remained
one
mysterious
,
unexplored
gap
,
far
to
the
north
.

Nearly
twenty-five
years
before
,
Captain
John
Davis
had
noted
,
as
he
sailed
near
the
Arctic
Circle
,
a
very
great
gulf
,
the
water
whirling
and
roaring
,
as
it
were
the
meeting
of
tides
.

Ahead
were
perilous
,
ice-filled
waters
.

On
the
second
voyage
,
he
had
turned
back
at
the
frozen
island
of
Novaya
Zemlya
and
meekly
given
the
crew
a
certificate
stating
that
he
did
so
of
his
own
free
will
--
which
was
obviously
not
the
case
.

Worse
,
his
present
crew
included
five
men
who
had
sailed
with
him
before
.

Arnold
Lodley
and
Michael
Perse
were
like
the
rest
--
lukewarm
,
ready
to
swing
against
Hudson
in
a
crisis
.

Hudson's
first
error
of
the
fourth
voyage
occurred
only
a
few
miles
down
the
Thames
.

There
at
the
river's
edge
waited
one
Henry
Greene
,
whom
Hudson
listed
as
a
clerk
.

For
the
first
three
weeks
,
the
ship
skirted
up
the
east
coast
of
Great
Britain
,
then
turned
westward
.

On
May
11
,
she
reached
Iceland
.

Fog
hung
over
the
route
constantly
.

Turbulent
tides
rose
as
much
as
fifty
feet
.

After
finding
that
its
coasts
led
nowhere
,
however
,
he
turned
north
again
,
toward
the
main
,
ice-filled
passageway
--
and
the
crew
,
at
first
uneasy
,
then
frightened
,
rebelled
.

One
man
remarked
that
if
he
had
a
hundred
pounds
,
he
would
give
ninety
of
them
to
be
back
in
England
.

For
he
seemed
to
sense
at
once
that
before
him
was
no
South
Sea
,
but
the
solid
bulk
of
the
North
American
continent
.

The
trial
was
held
September
10
.

Cook
Bennett
Mathues
said
Juet
had
predicted
bloodshed
on
the
ship
.

Hudson
deposed
Juet
and
cut
his
pay
.

There
were
other
shifts
and
pay
cuts
according
to
the
way
individuals
had
conducted
themselves
.

Seven
hundred
miles
south
of
York
Factory
,
at
the
Forks
of
the
Red
and
the
Assiniboine
,
twenty-three
men
located
a
settlement
in
August
1812
.

Within
a
few
years
the
Scots
,
engaged
in
breaking
the
thick
sod
and
stirring
the
rich
soil
of
the
valley
,
were
joined
by
a
group
called
Meurons
.

The
latter
,
members
of
two
regiments
of
Swiss
mercenaries
transported
by
Great
Britain
to
Canada
to
fight
the
Americans
in
the
War
of
1812
,
had
settled
in
Montreal
and
Kingston
at
the
close
of
the
war
in
1815
.

It
was
the
low
yield
of
the
Selkirk
plots
and
the
ravages
of
grasshoppers
in
1818
that
led
to
the
dispersal
of
the
settlement
southward
.

They
were
held
together
by
pegs
and
withes
and
in
later
times
drawn
by
a
single
ox
in
thills
.

This
epic
effort
to
secure
seed
for
the
colony
cost
Selkirk
Ab1,040
.

Activity
by
British
traders
and
the
presence
of
a
colony
on
the
Red
prompted
the
United
State
War
Department
in
1819
to
send
Lieutenant-Colonel
Henry
Leavenworth
from
Detroit
to
put
a
post
300
miles
northwest
of
Prairie
Du
Chien
,
until
then
the
most
advanced
United
States
post
.

He
set
out
on
his
700-mile
return
journey
with
five
families
of
discontented
and
disappointed
Swiss
who
turned
their
eyes
toward
the
United
States
.

I
have
done
everything
,
he
wrote
,
to
break
up
the
whole
of
that
unfortunate
establishment
.

The
disasters
of
1825-1826
caused
more
to
leave
.

In
April
came
a
rapid
thaw
that
produced
high
waters
which
did
not
recede
until
mid-June
.

Below
the
fort
,
high
bluffs
extended
uninterruptedly
for
six
miles
along
the
Mississippi
River
.

At
the
point
where
they
ended
,
another
settlement
grew
up
around
a
chapel
built
at
the
boat
landing
by
Father
Lucian
Galtier
in
1840
.

Accordingly
,
though
the
practice
violated
the
no-trading
provision
of
the
Selkirk
charter
which
reserved
all
such
activity
in
merchandise
and
furs
to
the
Hudson's
Bay
Company
,
some
settlers
went
into
trade
.

Despite
this
prohibiton
,
by
1844
some
of
the
Fort
Garry
merchants
were
trading
with
the
Indians
for
furs
.

Indeed
,
no
richer
humor
is
to
be
found
in
the
whole
of
American
literature
than
in
the
letters
of
the
semi-literate
men
who
wore
the
blue
and
the
gray
.

Yanks
were
equally
adept
at
figurative
expression
.

Still
another
,
annoyed
by
the
brevity
of
a
recently
received
missive
,
wrote
:
yore
letter
was
short
and
sweet
,
jist
like
a
roasted
maget
.

She
is
well-educated
and
refined
,
all
wildcat
and
fur
,
and
Union
from
the
muzzle
to
the
crupper
.

When
you
see
them
again
give
them
my
love
--
not
best
respects
now
,
but
love
by
God
.

William
R.
Stillwell
,
an
admirable
Georgian
whose
delightful
correspondence
is
preserved
in
the
Georgia
Department
of
Archives
and
History
,
liked
to
tease
his
wife
in
his
letters
.

Charles
Thiot
,
a
splendid
Georgia
soldier
,
differed
from
most
of
his
comrades
in
the
ranks
in
that
he
was
the
owner
of
a
large
plantation
,
well-educated
,
and
nearly
fifty
years
of
age
.

Near
the
end
of
his
service
he
wrote
that
when
the
war
was
over
he
was
going
to
buy
two
pups
,
name
one
of
them
Fall-in
and
the
other
Close-up
,
and
then
shoot
them
both
,
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
Fall-in
and
Close-up
.

The
soldiers
who
comprised
the
rank
and
file
of
the
Civil
War
armies
were
an
earthy
people
.

Johnny
Rebs
from
the
deep
South
who
were
plagued
with
diarrhoea
after
transfer
to
the
Virginia
front
often
informed
their
families
that
they
were
suffering
from
the
the
Virginia
quickstep
.

The
letters
which
poured
forth
from
camps
were
usually
written
under
adverse
circumstances
.

Most
of
the
letters
were
written
in
the
hubbub
of
camp
,
on
stumps
,
pieces
of
bark
,
drum
heads
,
or
the
knee
.

Just
count
each
blot
a
dodge
and
add
in
a
few
for
I
don't
dodge
every
time
.

and
these
,
full
of
homely
advice
,
are
among
the
most
human
and
revealing
of
Civil
War
letters
.

Early
in
the
war
it
was
not
uncommon
for
planters'
sons
to
retain
in
camp
Negro
body
servants
to
perform
the
menial
chores
such
as
cooking
,
foraging
,
cleaning
the
quarters
,
shining
shoes
,
and
laundering
clothes
.

I
will
shute
him
as
shore
as
I
sea
him
.

Went
out
a
skouting
yesterday
.

We
got
to
one
house
where
there
were
five
secessionists
.

They
brok
&
run
and
Arch
holored
out
to
shoot
the
ornery
suns
of
biches
and
we
all
let
go
at
them
.

Thay
may
say
what
they
please
but
godamit
Pa
it
is
fun
.

He
is
not
worth
shucks
.

In
a
similar
vein
,
but
writing
from
the
opposite
side
,
Thomas
Taylor
,
a
private
in
the
6th
Alabama
Volunteers
,
in
a
letter
to
his
wife
,
stated
:
you
know
that
my
heart
is
with
you
but
I
never
could
have
been
satisfied
to
have
staid
at
home
when
my
country
is
invaded
by
a
thievin
foe
,
by
a
set
of
cowardly
skunks
whose
motto
is
Booty
.

As
a
country
superimposes
its
cultural
and
political
attitudes
on
others
,
it
searches
its
heritage
in
hopes
of
justifying
its
aggressiveness
.

Such
identification
comes
for
each
group
in
each
crisis
by
rewriting
history
into
legend
and
developing
appropriate
national
heroes
.

2
)
The
concept
that
an
American
national
folklore
exists
is
itself
probably
another
propagandistic
legend
.

Nor
have
we
remembered
that
in
the
melting
pot
of
America
the
hundreds
of
isolated
and
semi-isolated
ethnic
,
regional
and
occupational
groups
did
not
fuse
into
a
homogeneous
national
unit
until
long
after
education
and
industrialization
had
caused
them
to
cast
oral
tradition
aside
as
a
means
of
carrying
culturally
significant
material
.

On
the
other
we
have
the
flag-wavers
and
the
national
sentimentalists
who
have
been
willing
to
use
any
patriotic
,
frontier
western
or
colonial
material
willy-nilly
.

Unfortunately
,
few
of
the
artists
(
writers
,
movie
producers
,
dramatists
and
musicians
)
who
have
used
American
folklore
since
1900
have
known
enough
to
distinguish
between
the
two
streams
even
in
the
most
general
of
ways
.

But
there
are
also
the
commercial
propagandists
and
the
analysts
--
one
dominated
by
money
,
the
other
by
nineteenth-century
German
scholarship
.

This
has
not
,
however
,
prevented
publishers
from
labeling
him
a
folk
poet
,
simply
because
he
is
a
rural
one
.

The
coalition
was
to
prove
inadvisable
.

O'Banion
was
a
complex
and
frightening
man
,
whose
bright
blue
eyes
stared
with
a
kind
of
frozen
candour
into
others'
.

Like
a
fair
number
of
bootleggers
he
disliked
alcohol
.

He
had
no
apparent
comprehension
of
morality
;
;

he
divided
humanity
into
right
guys
and
wrong
guys
,
and
the
wrong
ones
he
was
always
willing
to
kill
and
trample
under
.

He
walked
with
a
heavy
list
to
the
right
,
as
that
leg
was
four
inches
shorter
than
the
other
,
but
the
lurch
did
not
reduce
his
feline
quickness
with
his
guns
.

In
his
teens
O'Banion
was
enrolled
in
the
vicious
Market
Street
gang
and
he
became
a
singing
waiter
in
McGovern's
Cafe
,
a
notoriously
low
and
rowdy
dive
in
North
Clark
Street
,
where
befuddled
customers
were
methodically
looted
of
their
money
by
the
singing
waiters
before
being
thrown
out
.

He
was
also
at
the
same
time
gaining
practical
experience
as
a
safe
breaker
and
highwayman
,
and
learning
how
to
shoot
to
kill
from
a
Neanderthal
convicted
murderer
named
Gene
Geary
,
later
committed
to
Chester
Asylum
as
a
homicidal
maniac
,
but
whose
eyes
misted
with
tears
when
the
young
Dion
sang
a
ballad
about
an
Irish
mother
in
his
clear
and
syrupy
tenor
.

But
by
now
O'Banion's
political
pull
was
beginning
to
be
effective
.

the
jury
wanted
better
evidence
than
that
and
he
was
acquitted
,
at
a
cost
of
$30,000
in
bribes
,
it
was
estimated
.

He
conducted
it
with
less
diplomacy
and
more
spontaneous
violence
than
the
Sicilians
,
but
he
had
his
huge
North
Side
portion
to
exploit
and
he
made
a
great
deal
of
money
.

The
guest
list
is
in
itself
a
little
parable
of
the
state
of
American
civic
life
at
this
time
.

On
Election
Day
--
November
4
--
he
energetically
marshalled
his
force
of
bludgeon
men
,
bribers
,
and
experts
in
forging
repeat
votes
.

The
result
was
a
landslide
for
the
Republican
candidates
.

This
further
demonstration
of
O'Banion's
ballooning
power
did
not
please
Torrio
and
Capone
.

O'Banion
tucked
away
his
gun
and
walked
out
of
the
theatre
;
;

That
sort
of
braggadocio
,
for
that
sort
of
reason
,
in
the
view
of
Torrio
and
Capone
,
was
a
nonsense
.

A
further
example
of
the
incompatible
difference
in
personalities
was
when
two
policemen
held
up
a
Torrio
beer
convoy
on
a
West
Side
street
and
demanded
$300
to
let
it
through
.

To
them
bums
?
?

But
he
still
showed
no
intention
of
sharing
with
the
syndicate
.

Still
more
jealous
bitterness
was
engendered
by
the
O'Banion
gang's
seizure
from
a
West
Side
marshalling
yard
of
a
freight-car
load
of
Canadian
whisky
worth
$100,000
and
by
one
of
the
biggest
coups
of
the
Prohibition
era
--
the
Sibley
warehouse
robbery
,
which
became
famous
for
the
cool
brazenness
of
the
operation
.

its
waves
persisted
for
a
week
and
were
felt
as
far
away
as
the
English
coast
.

Tsunami
are
rare
,
however
,
in
the
Atlantic
Ocean
;
;

A
tsunami
in
the
Hawaiian
Islands
in
1869
washed
away
an
entire
town
(
Ponoluu
)
,
leaving
only
two
forlorn
trees
standing
where
the
community
had
been
.

The
dimensions
of
these
waves
dwarf
all
our
usual
standards
of
measurement
.

An
ordinary
sea
wave
is
rarely
more
than
a
few
hundred
feet
long
from
crest
to
crest
--
no
longer
than
320
feet
in
the
Atlantic
or
1,000
feet
in
the
Pacific
.

Lagrange's
law
says
that
its
velocity
is
equal
to
the
square
root
of
the
product
of
the
depth
times
the
acceleration
due
to
gravity
.

The
seemingly
quiet
ocean
had
crashed
a
wall
of
water
from
10
to
100
feet
high
upon
beaches
crowded
with
bathers
,
drowning
thousands
of
them
and
flattening
villages
along
the
shore
.

This
is
followed
by
a
tremendous
suck
of
water
away
from
the
shore
as
the
first
great
trough
arrives
.

At
Hilo
large
numbers
of
people
ran
out
to
inspect
the
amazing
spectacle
of
the
denuded
beach
.

After
an
earthquake
in
Japan
in
1793
people
on
the
coast
at
Tugaru
were
so
terrified
by
the
extraordinary
ebbing
of
the
sea
that
they
scurried
to
higher
ground
.

When
a
second
quake
came
,
they
dashed
back
to
the
beach
,
fearing
that
they
might
be
buried
under
landslides
.

Just
as
they
reached
the
shore
,
the
first
huge
wave
crashed
upon
them
.

The
waves
are
separated
by
intervals
of
15
minutes
to
an
hour
or
more
(
because
of
their
great
length
)
,
and
this
has
often
lulled
people
into
thinking
after
the
first
great
wave
has
crashed
that
it
is
all
over
.

Their
onrush
and
retreat
,
he
reported
,
was
accompanied
by
a
great
hissing
,
roaring
and
rattling
.

On
some
of
the
islands'
beaches
the
waves
came
in
gently
;
;

they
were
steepest
on
the
shores
facing
the
direction
of
the
seaquake
from
which
the
waves
had
come
.

The
tsunami-warning
system
developed
since
the
1946
disaster
in
Hawaii
relies
mainly
on
a
simple
and
ingenious
instrument
devised
by
Commander
C.
K.
Green
of
the
Coast
and
Geodetic
Survey
staff
.

Such
equipment
has
been
installed
at
Hilo
,
Midway
,
Attu
and
Dutch
Harbor
.

By
means
of
charts
showing
wave-travel
times
and
depths
in
the
ocean
at
various
locations
,
it
is
possible
to
estimate
the
rate
of
approach
and
probable
time
of
arrival
at
Hawaii
of
a
tsunami
getting
under
way
at
any
spot
in
the
Pacific
.

The
civil
and
military
authorities
are
then
advised
of
the
danger
,
and
they
issue
warnings
and
take
all
necessary
protective
steps
.

All
of
these
activities
are
geared
to
a
top-priority
communication
system
,
and
practice
tests
have
been
held
to
assure
that
everything
will
work
smoothly
.

Since
the
1946
disaster
there
have
been
15
tsunami
in
the
Pacific
,
but
only
one
was
of
any
consequence
.

At
17:07
that
afternoon
(
Greenwich
time
)
the
shock
was
recorded
by
the
seismograph
alarm
in
Honolulu
.

But
it
is
plain
that
a
warning
system
,
however
efficient
,
is
not
enough
.

and
everywhere
can
be
found
scars
of
earlier
breaks
once
deeply
buried
.

These
waves
have
shown
that
1,800
miles
below
the
surface
a
liquid
core
begins
,
and
that
it
,
in
turn
,
has
a
solid
inner
core
.

At
twelve
minutes
after
five
on
the
morning
of
Wednesday
,
April
18
,
1906
,
San
Francisco
was
shaken
by
a
severe
earthquake
.

Wiry
and
burr-headed
,
with
steel
blue
eyes
and
a
chest
splattered
with
medals
,
Chandler
is
the
epitome
of
the
old-time
trooper
.

In
combat
,
helping
your
CO
make
a
fool
of
himself
might
mean
getting
yourself
killed
.

But
his
first
few
days
with
Troop
H
were
full
of
surprises
,
beginning
with
First
Sergeant
Robert
Early
.

Instead
Sergeant
Early
was
quiet
,
sharp
and
confident
.

He
could
lead
a
patrol
and
he
knew
his
paper
work
.

Further
,
he
had
taken
full
advantage
of
the
Army's
correspondence
courses
.

But
what
made
the
load
lighter
was
the
realization
that
every
officer
,
non-com
and
trooper
was
ready
and
willing
to
help
him
carry
it
,
for
the
good
of
the
troop
and
the
regiment
.

The
faces
belonged
to
Lieutenant
Marvin
Goulding
,
his
wife
and
their
two
children
.

He
set
out
to
keep
Troop
H
the
best
troop
in
the
best
regiment
.

Another
force
flanked
the
company
and
took
up
a
position
on
a
hill
to
the
rear
.

One
of
the
more
seriously
wounded
was
Lieutenant
Carroll
,
the
young
officer
bucking
for
the
Regular
Army
.

Chandler
left
Carroll
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
to
direct
any
reinforcements
he
could
find
to
the
fight
.

He
had
formed
his
own
task
force
of
three
stragglers
and
led
them
up
the
hill
in
a
Fighting
Seventh
charge
.

He
went
down
like
a
wet
rag
and
the
attackers
hit
the
dirt
in
the
face
of
the
withering
enemy
fire
.

Marvin
Goulding
saw
what
was
happening
.

Okay
,
men
,
he
said
.

Though
Bob
Carroll
seemed
to
have
had
his
head
practically
blown
off
by
the
exploding
grenade
,
he
lived
.

Take
the
case
of
Major
Marcus
A.
Reno
,
who
survived
the
Battle
of
The
Little
Big
Horn
in
1876
.

From
the
enlisted
men
he
pistol-whipped
to
the
subordinate
officer
whose
wife
he
tried
to
rape
,
a
lot
of
men
had
plenty
of
reason
heartily
to
dislike
Marcus
Reno
.

But
when
a
board
of
inquiry
was
called
to
look
into
the
charges
of
cowardice
made
against
him
,
the
men
who
had
seen
Reno
leave
the
battlefield
and
the
officer
who
had
heard
Reno
suggest
that
the
wounded
be
left
to
be
tortured
by
the
Sioux
,
refused
to
say
a
harsh
word
against
him
.

Moreover
,
as
Communist
power
increases
,
the
enjoyment
of
these
conditions
throughout
the
world
diminishes
pro
rata
and
the
possibility
of
their
restoration
becomes
increasingly
remote
.

but
if
we
must
choose
between
peace
and
keeping
the
Communists
out
of
Berlin
,
then
we
must
fight
.

The
uses
of
power

Suppose
,
he
says
,
that
the
tables
were
turned
,
and
we
were
in
the
Soviets'
position
:
There
would
be
more
than
2,000
modern
Soviet
fighters
,
all
better
than
ours
,
stationed
at
250
bases
in
Mexico
and
the
Caribbean
.

Prestige
is
a
measure
of
how
other
people
think
of
you
,
well
or
ill
.

Only
the
vain
and
incurably
sentimental
among
us
will
lose
sleep
simply
because
foreign
peoples
are
not
as
impressed
by
our
strength
as
they
ought
to
be
.

And
this
may
be
as
far
as
the
process
will
go
.

Laos
is
teetering
between
Communism
and
pro-Communist
neutralism
;
;

A
short
time
ago
all
Africa
was
a
Western
preserve
.

In
some
countries
the
trend
has
gone
further
than
others
:
Mexico
,
Panama
,
and
Venezuela
are
displaying
open
sympathy
for
Castroism
,
and
there
is
no
country
--
save
the
Dominican
Republic
whose
funeral
services
we
recently
arranged
--
where
Castroism
and
Anti-Americanism
does
not
prevent
the
government
from
unqualifiedly
espousing
the
American
cause
.

And
contrary
to
what
has
been
said
recently
,
we
did
not
wait
for
outside
pressures
and
world
opinion
to
bring
down
that
Communist
government
;
;

Then
he
was
sick
.

Then
the
lights
went
out
.

Better
stay
in
the
hotel
lobby
,
where
the
walls
looked
good
and
thick
.

Chinese
and
Indian
merchants
across
the
street
were
slamming
their
steel
shutters
.

But
what
was
the
story
?
?

Gunfire
saves
the
moon

A
traditional
Lao
explanation
is
that
the
moon
was
being
swallowed
by
a
toad
,
and
the
remedy
was
to
make
all
possible
noise
,
ideally
with
firearms
.

A
restaurant
posted
a
reminder
to
patrons
who
became
excited
and
left
without
paying
their
checks
.

And
no
wonder
,
for
Vientiane
,
the
old
City
of
Sandalwood
,
had
become
the
City
of
Bullet
Holes
.

I
saw
holes
in
planes
at
the
airport
and
in
cars
in
the
streets
.

Along
the
main
thoroughfares
hardly
a
house
had
not
been
peppered
.

Practically
all
the
people
of
Laos
,
he
explained
--
about
two
million
of
them
--
are
rice
farmers
,
and
the
means
and
motives
of
modern
war
are
as
strange
to
them
as
clocks
and
steel
plows
.

They
look
after
their
fields
and
children
and
water
buffaloes
in
ten
or
eleven
thousand
villages
,
with
an
average
of
200
souls
.

They
spread
over
an
area
no
larger
than
Oregon
;
;

Boun
My
--
the
name
means
one
who
has
a
boun
,
a
celebration
,
and
is
therefore
lucky
--
was
born
in
Savannakhet
,
the
Border
of
Paradise
.

Alas
,
so
it
almost
proved
for
us
,
too
.

Nobody
wanted
Americans
to
be
hurt
or
captured
,
and
few
soldiers
could
be
spared
as
escorts
.

We
were
told
that
to
the
Pathet
Lao
,
a
kidnaped
American
was
worth
at
least
$750
,
a
fortune
in
Laos
.

That
way
they
have
an
infirmary
for
$400
.

Ask
Mr.
Keo
.

Our
people
have
been
used
to
accepting
things
as
they
found
them
,
he
said
.

Where
there
was
no
road
,
they
lived
without
one
.

But
our
stumping
tour
of
the
south
wasn't
all
misery
.

Strings
keep
souls
in
place

In
the
village
of
Soukhouma
,
which
means
Peaceful
,
we
had
a
baci
.

The
preparations
were
elaborate
:
flowers
,
candles
,
incense
sticks
,
rice
wine
,
dozens
of
delicacies
,
and
pieces
of
white
cotton
string
.

Those
souls
like
to
wander
off
,
and
must
be
called
back
.

John
said
:
I
have
some
antiseptic
salve
with
me
,
but
it's
too
late
for
that
.

I
want
to
show
respect
for
my
parents'
religion
was
the
way
in
which
a
boy
justified
his
inhabiting
a
halfway
house
of
Judaism
.

When
you
marry
,
you
want
to
have
things
in
common
,
a
girl
said
,
and
it's
hard
when
you
don't
marry
someone
with
your
own
background
.

One
of
the
significant
things
about
Jewish
culture
in
the
older
teen
years
is
that
it
is
largely
college-oriented
.

Sixty-five
per
cent
of
the
Jewish
teen-agers
of
college
age
attend
institutions
of
higher
learning
.

In
their
first
two
years
in
high
school
,
Jewish
boys
in
this
town
make
strenuous
exertions
to
win
positions
on
the
school
teams
.

It
is
significant
,
too
,
that
the
older
teen-agers
I
interviewed
believed
,
unlike
the
younger
ones
,
that
Jewish
students
tend
to
do
better
academically
than
their
gentile
counterparts
.

The
motivations
for
both
sexes
,
to
be
sure
,
are
different
.

It
is
they
who
read
--
and
make
--
Jewish
best-sellers
and
then
persuade
their
husbands
to
read
them
.

People
automatically
assume
that
I
am
in
college
,
a
nineteen-year-old
machinist
observed
irritably
.

One
of
the
reasons
for
the
high
percentage
of
Jewish
teen-agers
in
college
is
that
a
great
many
urban
Jews
are
enabled
to
attend
local
colleges
at
modest
cost
.

What
is
noteworthy
about
this
large
group
of
teen-agers
is
that
,
although
their
attitudes
hardly
differentiate
them
from
their
gentile
counterparts
,
they
actually
lead
their
lives
in
a
vast
self-enclosed
Jewish
cosmos
with
relatively
little
contact
with
the
non-Jewish
world
.

There
is
,
to
begin
,
an
important
sex
difference
.

First
,
the
girl's
education
has
a
lower
priority
than
the
son's
.

The
consequence
of
this
is
that
the
girls
at
Brooklyn
College
outnumber
the
boys
and
do
somewhat
better
academically
.

At
the
same
time
,
there
is
a
good
deal
of
self-congratulation
at
attending
a
good
college
--
they
are
even
inclined
to
exaggerate
its
not
inconsiderable
virtues
--
and
they
express
pleasure
at
the
cozy
in-group
feeling
that
the
college
generates
.

It's
people
of
your
own
kind
,
a
girl
remarked
.

You
don't
have
to
watch
what
you
say
.

And
the
rebellion
of
these
third
generation
Jews
is
not
the
traditional
conflict
of
culture
but
,
rather
,
a
protest
against
a
culture
that
they
view
as
softly
and
insidiously
enveloping
.

The
domestic
tentacles
even
extend
to
the
choice
of
a
major
field
.

But
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
some
of
the
new
watering
places
--
Fire
Island
,
Nantucket
,
Westhampton
,
Long
Island
,
for
example
--
tend
to
be
homogeneously
Jewish
.

There
are
boxed
proclamations
in
the
newspaper
of
watchings
,
pinnings
,
ringings
,
engagements
,
and
marriages
in
a
scrupulously
graded
hierarchy
of
felicity
.

The
Ivy
League
enjoys
no
easy
dominion
here
,
and
the
boys
are
as
likely
to
dress
in
rather
foppish
Continental
fashion
,
or
even
in
nondescript
working
class
manner
,
as
they
are
in
the
restrained
,
button-down
Ivy
way
.

Or
she
might
place
cornstarch
in
the
oven
for
a
short
time
and
then
apply
this
under
her
breasts
.

Bruises
,
burns
,
cuts
,
etc.
,
occurred
frequently
on
the
frontier
,
and
folk
medicine
gave
the
answers
to
these
problems
too
.

Tobacco
was
common
first
aid
.

A
chaw
of
tobacco
put
on
an
open
wound
was
both
antiseptic
and
healing
.

His
brother
ran
a
mile
to
get
the
father
;
;

when
they
reached
the
boy
,
the
father
sliced
a
new
plug
of
tobacco
,
put
the
scalp
back
in
place
,
and
covered
the
raw
edges
with
the
slices
.

While
nowadays
we
recognize
the
fact
that
there
are
many
causes
for
bleeding
at
the
nose
,
not
long
ago
a
nosebleed
was
simply
that
,
and
treatment
had
little
variation
.

Since
a
fall
or
blow
might
have
caused
it
,
a
cold
pack
was
usually
first
aid
.

This
might
be
applied
to
the
top
of
the
nose
or
the
back
of
the
neck
,
pressed
on
the
upper
lip
,
or
inserted
into
the
nostril
(
cotton
was
usually
used
in
this
last
)
.

Old
sores
could
be
healed
by
the
constant
application
of
a
wash
made
of
equal
parts
vinegar
and
water
.

get
a
bite
,
spit
on
it
was
a
proverb
.

so
small
as
to
be
scarcely
visible
to
the
eye
,
they
buried
themselves
in
the
victim's
flesh
.

Bedbugs
were
a
common
pest
in
pioneer
days
;
;

Kerosene
was
very
effective
in
ridding
pioneer
homes
of
the
pests
.

the
particle
would
then
move
toward
the
nose
,
where
it
could
be
wiped
out
with
a
wisp
of
cotton
.

They
drank
half
a
cup
of
this
morning
and
night
,
and
they
also
washed
and
soaked
their
hands
in
the
same
solution
.

Now
one
hears
that
heat
and
hot
water
are
used
instead
.

Another
remedy
was
oil
of
eucalyptus
,
used
as
well
for
chilblains
.

Chilblains
were
also
treated
with
tincture
of
capsicum
or
cabbage
leaves
.

Another
poultice
was
made
from
the
inner
bark
of
the
elm
tree
,
steeped
in
water
until
it
formed
a
sticky
,
gummy
solution
.

There
were
many
cures
for
warts
.

another
said
it
should
be
rubbed
with
a
cut
potato
three
times
daily
.

the
onion
was
then
fastened
together
with
string
and
placed
beneath
a
dripping
eave
.

As
the
onion
decayed
,
so
did
the
wart
.

This
does
give
relief
,
as
I
can
testify
.

One
doctor
prescribed
a
tablespoon
of
whiskey
or
brandy
before
each
meal
for
leg
cramps
.

he
may
also
be
the
one
who
makes
and
bottles
the
best
blends
--
sound
wines
from
vineyards
generally
in
his
own
district
.

This
is
the
only
valid
,
and
extenuating
,
argument
that
may
be
advanced
in
defense
of
the
reprehensible
attitude
of
the
common
wine
waiter
.

Faced
,
on
the
one
hand
,
with
an
always
exhaustible
supply
of
his
best
wines
,
and
on
the
other
by
a
clientele
usually
equipped
with
inexhaustible
pocketbooks
,
it
is
a
wonder
indeed
that
all
wine
waiters
are
not
afflicted
with
chronic
ambivalence
.

Too
much
dampness
in
the
cellar
rots
the
corks
,
again
with
ill
effects
.

Seasonal
rises
or
drops
in
temperature
are
bad
for
wine
:
they
age
it
prematurely
.

Prolonged
vibration
is
also
undesirable
;
;

consequently
,
one's
wine
closet
or
cellar
should
be
away
from
machines
or
electrically
driven
furnaces
.

If
one
lives
near
a
subway
or
an
express
parkway
,
the
solution
is
to
have
one's
wines
stored
with
a
dealer
and
brought
home
a
few
at
a
time
.

All
in
all
,
though
,
there
is
a
good
deal
of
nonsense
expended
over
the
preparations
thought
necessary
for
ordinary
wine
drinking
;
;

A
white
wine
,
already
at
cool
cellar
temperature
,
may
be
adequately
chilled
in
a
bucket
of
ice
and
water
or
the
freezing
compartment
of
a
refrigerator
(
the
former
is
far
preferable
)
in
about
fifteen
minutes
;
;

but
again
,
as
one
will
have
observed
at
any
restaurant
worth
its
salt
,
wine
should
be
served
in
a
large
,
tulip-shaped
glass
,
which
is
never
filled
more
than
half
full
.

This
invariably
effaces
any
wine's
character
,
and
drives
its
fragrance
underground
.

It
should
not
be
forgotten
that
wines
mature
fastest
in
half-bottles
,
less
fast
in
full
bottles
,
slowly
in
Magnums
--
and
slower
yet
in
Tregnums
,
double
Magnums
,
Jeroboams
,
Methuselahs
,
and
Imperiales
,
respectively
.

but
the
first
glass
of
Chateau
d'Yquem
or
Montrachet
is
a
great
deal
better
than
the
last
!
!

By
tradition
,
a
red
wine
should
be
served
at
approximately
room
temperature
--
if
anything
a
little
cooler
--
and
be
aged
enough
for
the
tannin
and
acids
to
have
worked
out
and
the
sediment
have
settled
well
.

Many
people
use
wicker
cradles
for
old
red
wine
,
lifting
the
bottle
carefully
from
the
bin
into
the
cradle
and
eventually
to
the
table
,
without
disturbing
the
sediment
.

Red
wines
of
good
years
tend
to
mature
later
and
to
keep
longer
;
;

the
average
claret
is
notably
longer-lived
than
its
opposite
number
,
red
Burgundy
.

Giffen
lost
no
time
in
visiting
the
plantation
.

The
emancipation
plan
would
not
only
be
injurious
to
all
the
heirs
,
he
contended
,
but
would
be
a
form
of
cruelty
perpetrated
on
the
hapless
Negroes
.

The
suggestion
that
Giffen
hire
out
the
slaves
was
not
realistic
,
since
no
planter
would
take
the
risk
of
having
Negroes
who
knew
they
were
to
be
free
living
with
his
own
slaves
.

William
,
who
did
not
write
to
Gorham
,
told
Giffen
that
unless
he
could
operate
the
plantation
as
usual
for
a
year
,
he
would
sue
amicably
to
protect
his
interests
.

A
disposition
to
exert
themselves
for
my
benefit
would
perhaps
be
a
motive
with
some
of
them
to
come
into
the
scheme
.

When
he
heard
of
his
brothers'
anger
,
Palfrey
was
still
hopeful
that
they
could
be
persuaded
to
accept
his
notion
of
paying
wages
.

If
not
,
he
was
willing
to
accede
to
William's
wishes
in
any
way
that
did
not
block
his
ultimate
aim
.

This
cold
reckoning
of
human
worth
in
a
legal
paper
,
devoid
of
compassion
or
humanity
,
was
all
he
needed
.

Rose
,
a
twelve-year-old
with
child-bearing
potential
,
was
worth
$400
.

Palfrey's
brothers
each
received
lots
of
sixteen
Negroes
,
and
for
bookkeeping
purposes
it
was
agreed
that
all
lots
were
to
be
valued
at
$6,666.66
.

Yet
even
if
he
could
get
the
necessary
approval
,
fourteen
of
his
Negroes
could
not
be
manumitted
without
special
permission
.

News
of
the
legislative
veto
appeared
in
the
New
Orleans
papers
,
and
Henry
and
William
became
incensed
by
the
fact
that
they
had
not
been
told
of
the
attempt
in
advance
.

His
duties
as
Massachusetts
Secretary
of
State
obliged
him
to
wait
until
the
adjournment
of
the
legislature
in
mid-April
.

Palfrey
told
his
wife
of
his
intentions
for
the
first
time
,
and
left
for
New
Orleans
apprehensively
invoking
a
special
blessing
of
Providence
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
see
his
family
again
.

During
his
journey
Palfrey
stopped
off
to
see
two
abolitionists
.

Mrs.
Child
,
who
had
once
apologized
for
sending
editor
Palfrey
a
book
on
slavery
,
now
confided
that
she
had
helped
one
of
Henry
Palfrey's
slaves
escape
to
Canada
some
years
before
,
but
asked
him
not
to
advertise
the
fact
in
Louisiana
.

She
agreed
to
take
charge
of
five
or
six
of
the
Negroes
should
Palfrey
decide
to
send
them
north
immediately
.

Instead
of
the
expected
annoyances
due
to
the
nature
of
his
mission
,
he
received
many
calling
cards
and
invitations
from
gentlemen
of
mark
,
on
whom
I
had
no
sort
of
claim
,
&
have
had
many
more
invitations
than
I
could
accept
.

The
memory
of
this
southern
hospitality
did
not
survive
the
trials
of
coming
antislavery
years
and
Civil
War
.

All
the
slaves
joined
in
requesting
that
they
be
allowed
to
delay
their
departure
until
the
end
of
the
planting
season
,
so
that
they
could
get
in
their
own
little
produce
.

the
slaves
were
to
remain
as
wage
laborers
for
his
account
.

William's
threat
that
under
no
conditions
would
he
allow
freedom-conscious
slaves
to
mix
with
his
own
was
not
carried
out
,
for
the
plantation
continued
in
operation
as
before
.

From
Cambridge
,
Palfrey
maintained
a
close
interest
in
the
welfare
of
his
slaves
.

When
a
sailing
date
of
March
,
1845
was
finally
established
,
Palfrey
made
sure
that
the
Negroes
would
have
comfortable
quarters
in
New
Orleans
and
aboard
ship
.

Giffen
assured
him
that
the
captain
and
his
mate
had
personally
promised
to
treat
the
Negroes
with
consideration
.

Palfrey
was
also
concerned
about
the
question
of
what
wage
to
pay
for
their
labor
throughout
1844
.

Slavery
was
prohibited
in
Massachusetts
by
the
terms
of
the
constitution
of
1780
,
which
declared
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
.

Nevertheless
,
Palfrey
arranged
a
religious
ceremony
at
King's
Chapel
to
formalize
the
emancipation
.

An
eyewitness
recalled
how
awkward
the
red-turbaned
colored
women
appeared
as
they
curtseyed
in
the
church
doorway
,
and
the
diffidence
the
former
slaves
displayed
while
they
listened
to
the
few
words
that
declared
them
free
.

Palfrey
tried
fruitlessly
to
place
a
Negro
boy
in
the
Hopedale
Community
,
but
he
had
better
luck
in
his
other
attempts
.

This
group
had
been
Palfrey's
greatest
worry
since
Anna
was
in
bad
health
,
and
her
children
were
too
young
to
work
for
their
keep
.

But
certainly
the
New
Frontier
has
brought
to
Washington
a
group
more
varied
in
background
and
interest
.

Many
of
the
new
appointees
are
art
collectors
.

Unlike
Wilson
,
who
at
times
seemed
almost
anti-intellectual
in
his
earthy
pragmatism
.

McNamara
is
the
scholar-businessman
.

The
Press
Secretary
,
Pierre
Salinger
,
was
a
child
prodigy
as
a
pianist
.

In
fact
,
the
search
is
almost
more
important
than
the
find
.

At
last
count
,
sixteen
former
Rhodes
Scholars
(
see
box
on
page
13
)
had
been
appointed
to
the
Administration
,
second
in
number
only
to
its
Harvard
graduates
.

Besides
Schlesinger
,
the
Justice
Department's
Information
Director
,
Edwin
Guthman
,
has
won
a
Pulitzer
Prize
(
for
national
reporting
)
.

Postmaster
General
J.
Edward
Day
,
who
must
deal
with
matters
of
postal
censorship
,
is
himself
author
of
a
novel
,
Bartholf
Street
,
albeit
one
he
was
obliged
to
publish
at
his
own
expense
.

A
man
of
great
talent
,
he
will
continue
to
serve
as
a
sort
of
Presidential
trouble-shooter
,
strictly
ex
officio
,
for
culture
.

But
even
while
sparring
furiously
with
Republican
politicians
,
he
displays
a
deep
and
awesome
veneration
for
anyone
with
cultural
attainments
.

His
private
dining
room
has
become
a
way
station
for
visiting
intellectuals
such
as
C.
P.
Snow
,
Arnold
Toynbee
,
and
Aaron
Copland
.

His
Ideas
in
this
respect
,
however
,
sometimes
arouse
critical
response
.

The
last
Congress
adopted
seven
bills
for
memorials
,
including
one
to
Taras
Shevchenko
,
the
Ukrainian
poet
laureate
;
;

eleven
others
were
introduced
.

It
now
serves
the
President
in
his
oval
office
.

With
its
coating
of
gold
radiator
paint
removed
--
a
gaucherie
of
some
earlier
tenant
--
it
will
now
occupy
its
rightful
place
in
the
oval
Blue
Room
on
the
first
floor
of
the
White
House
.

A
curator
has
been
appointed
.

Only
a
few
days
after
moving
into
the
White
House
.

One
of
the
offices
slated
for
reconstruction
is
the
aged
Court
of
Claims
,
diagonally
across
the
street
from
the
White
House
.

More
importantly
,
he
also
happens
to
be
the
brother-in-law
of
Sam
Rayburn
,
Speaker
of
the
House
.

On
delving
deeper
,
Walton
discovered
that
most
of
the
buildings
fronting
the
Square
could
be
classified
as
early
nondescript
.

The
attempt
to
save
the
Square's
historic
value
,
he
declares
,
came
half
a
century
too
late
.

But
there
has
always
been
an
outdoor
air
to
Dartmouth
.

The
would-be
sophisticate
and
the
citybred
youth
adopt
this
air
without
embarrassment
.

Thus
,
when
Dartmouth's
Winter
Carnival
--
widely
recognized
as
the
greatest
,
wildest
,
roaringest
college
weekend
anywhere
,
any
time
--
was
broadcast
over
a
national
television
hookup
,
Prexy
John
Sloan
Dickey
appeared
on
the
screen
in
rugged
winter
garb
,
topped
off
by
a
tam-o'-shanter
which
he
confessed
had
been
acquired
from
a
Smith
girl
.

There
is
much
to
be
said
for
a
college
that
,
while
happily
attuned
to
the
sophisticated
Ivies
,
still
gives
its
students
a
chance
to
get
up
early
in
the
morning
and
drive
along
back
roads
where
a
glimpse
of
small
game
,
deer
,
or
even
bear
is
not
uncommon
.

Eleazar
Wheelock
,
a
Presbyterian
minister
,
founded
the
school
in
1769
,
naming
it
after
the
second
earl
of
Dartmouth
,
its
sponsor
and
benefactor
.

Eleazar
,
pausing
on
the
Hanover
plain
,
found
its
great
forests
and
remoteness
good
and
with
his
own
hands
built
the
first
College
Hall
,
a
log
hut
dedicated
for
the
education
&
instruction
of
Youth
of
the
Indian
Tribes
in
this
Land
in
reading
,
writing
&
all
parts
of
learning
which
shall
appear
necessary
and
expedient
for
civilizing
&
christianizing
Children
of
Pagans
as
well
as
in
all
liberal
Arts
and
Sciences
;
;

A
road
had
to
be
hacked
through
trackless
forests
between
Hanover
and
Portsmouth
to
permit
Governor
Wentworth
and
a
company
of
gentlemen
to
attend
the
first
Dartmouth
commencement
in
1771
.

By
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
in
1893
,
when
the
Big
Three
,
Columbia
,
and
Penn
were
populous
centers
of
learning
,
Dartmouth
graduated
only
sixty-nine
.

Then
in
1893
Dr.
William
Jewett
Tucker
became
president
and
the
college's
great
awakening
began
.

The
presidents
of
Cornell
,
Wisconsin
,
C.C.N.Y.
,
Bowdoin
,
Vermont
,
Brown
,
Columbia
,
Princeton
,
Yale
,
and
Harvard
and
the
presidents
emeritus
of
Harvard
and
Michigan
were
there
.

But
it
has
achieved
a
cross-section
of
students
from
almost
all
the
states
,
and
two-thirds
of
its
undergraduates
come
from
outside
New
England
.

However
,
three
distinguished
associated
graduate
schools
offer
professional
curriculums
--
the
Dartmouth
Medical
School
(
third
oldest
in
the
country
and
founded
in
1797
)
,
the
Thayer
School
of
Engineering
,
and
the
Amos
Tuck
School
of
Business
Administration
.

The
Thayer
School
offers
a
year
of
postgraduate
study
in
somewhat
the
same
way
,
after
a
boy
wins
a
B.S.
in
engineering
.

So
Dartmouth
is
moving
closer
to
the
others
in
the
Ivy
group
.

The
person
who
left
the
buggy
there
has
never
been
identified
.

She
didn't
like
her
stepmother
,
but
nothing
is
known
to
have
occurred
shortly
before
the
crime
that
could
have
caused
such
a
murderous
rage
.

He
said
Morse
and
Borden
had
quarreled
violently
in
the
house
that
day
,
information
which
must
have
come
from
Lizzie
.

It
was
obviously
the
sound
of
this
argument
that
caused
Lizzie
to
close
her
door
.

The
New
Bedford
Standard-Times
has
reported
Knowlton
as
saying
,
long
after
the
trial
,
that
if
he
only
knew
what
Borden
said
during
his
conversation
with
Morse
,
he
would
have
convicted
somebody
.

They
were
a
vagabond
lot
and
considered
to
be
shady
and
undesirable
characters
.

These
officers
found
no
incriminating
information
.

The
woman
in
the
house
where
the
niece
was
staying
backed
up
his
story
and
said
she
left
when
he
did
to
shop
for
her
dinner
.

If
this
woman
had
delayed
until
after
11:20
to
start
her
shopping
,
she
would
have
had
little
time
in
which
to
prepare
the
substantial
meal
that
was
eaten
at
dinner
in
those
days
.

Questioned
further
,
Morse
said
that
there
had
been
four
or
five
priests
riding
on
the
same
car
with
him
.

The
conductor
did
recall
having
priests
as
passengers
and
this
satisfied
police
,
although
the
conductor
also
pointed
out
that
in
heavily
Catholic
Fall
River
there
were
priests
riding
on
almost
every
trip
the
streetcar
made
,
so
Morse's
statement
really
proved
nothing
.

Morse
testified
that
while
he
was
having
breakfast
in
the
dining
room
,
Mrs.
Borden
told
the
servant
,
Bridget
,
I
want
you
to
wash
these
windows
today
.

Morse's
knowledge
of
what
Mrs.
Borden
told
Bridget
could
indicate
that
he
had
returned
secretly
to
the
house
and
was
hidden
there
.

His
unconcerned
stroll
down
the
side
of
the
house
to
a
pear
tree
,
with
crowds
already
gathering
in
front
of
the
building
and
Sawyer
guarding
the
side
door
,
was
odd
.

The
motive
may
have
been
the
mysterious
quarrel
;
;

The
time
would
have
been
shortly
after
the
murder
of
Mrs.
Borden
and
they
noticed
nothing
unusual
in
his
behavior
.

He
said
he
had
promised
Mrs.
Borden
to
return
in
time
for
dinner
and
that
was
close
to
the
time
when
he
did
turn
up
at
the
Borden
house
.

indeed
,
it
was
probably
to
Mr.
Morse's
advantage
to
have
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Borden
alive
.

That
was
his
complete
discussion
of
Bridget
Sullivan
as
a
possible
suspect
.

She
replied
,
I
know
of
one
man
that
has
not
been
friendly
with
him
.

He
said
he
had
not
heard
of
anybody
else
.

She
was
apparently
the
pioneer
in
her
family
because
she
had
no
close
relatives
in
this
country
at
that
time
.

She
worked
as
a
domestic
,
first
in
Newport
for
a
year
,
and
then
in
South
Bethlehem
,
Pennsylvania
,
for
another
year
.

There
is
clear
evidence
that
Lucy
from
childhood
had
an
unusual
mind
.

more
chapters

Guizot

Lecky
and
Stanley's
Eastern
Church
.

Winslow
had
musical
talents
,
as
had
his
father
before
him
.

and
after
1883
,
was
professor
of
astronomy
at
Brown
University
.

After
her
father's
death
,
Lucy
and
her
youngest
sister
lived
for
a
few
years
with
Winslow
in
Washington
,
D.C.
.

Winslow
,
as
his
daughters
Eleanor
and
Margaret
recall
,
used
to
characterize
her
as
our
iron
sister
.

What
was
called
an
accidental
meeting
with
Miss
Packard
in
Washington
turned
her
attention
to
Spelman
.

and
as
graduates
gratefully
recall
,
she
drew
on
her
purse
as
well
.

Under
Miss
Upton
,
the
work
of
the
year
1909-10
went
forward
without
interruption
.

Yet
they
thrived
on
it
.

At
the
meeting
of
the
Board
of
Trustees
,
on
March
3
,
1910
,
Miss
Upton
presented
the
annual
report
of
the
President
.

She
urged
the
importance
of
more
thorough
preparation
for
admission
.

The
raising
of
the
$25,000
Improvement
Fund
two
days
before
the
time
limit
expired
,
and
the
spontaneous
praise
demonstration
held
afterward
on
the
campus
,
were
reported
as
events
which
had
brought
happiness
to
Miss
Giles
.

and
ground
had
been
broken
for
the
superintendent's
home
.

Miss
Upton
spoke
gratefully
of
the
response
of
Spelman
graduates
and
Negro
friends
in
helping
to
raise
the
Fund
,
and
their
continuing
efforts
to
raise
money
for
greatly
needed
current
expenses
.

and
one
of
$2,000
under
the
will
of
Miss
Celia
L.
Brett
of
Hamilton
,
New
York
,
a
friend
from
the
early
days
.

The
removal
of
Miss
Packard
18
years
earlier
had
caused
them
great
sorrow
,
but
they
still
had
Miss
Giles
.

But
she
decided
to
stay
at
Spelman
.

Quiet
and
energetic
,
cheerful
and
calm
,
she
too
was
a
power
in
the
development
of
the
seminary
.

With
infinite
patience
she
responded
to
every
call
,
no
matter
at
what
cost
to
herself
,
and
to
her
all
went
,
for
she
was
sure
to
have
the
needed
information
or
word
of
cheer
.

Formally
organized
vocational
programs
supported
by
federal
funds
allow
high
school
students
to
gain
experience
in
a
field
of
work
which
is
likely
to
lead
to
a
full-time
job
on
graduation
.

If
the
student
drops
out
of
high
school
,
the
break
with
the
school
is
even
more
complete
.

In
a
later
chapter
dealing
with
the
suburban
school
,
I
shall
discuss
the
importance
of
arranging
a
program
for
the
academically
talented
and
highly
gifted
youth
in
any
high
school
where
he
is
found
.

In
the
Negro
neighborhoods
and
also
to
some
extent
in
the
mixed
neighborhoods
the
problem
may
be
one
of
identification
and
motivation
.

Quite
the
contrary
,
as
I
can
testify
from
personal
experience
as
a
former
university
president
.

Here
again
we
run
into
the
roadblock
that
Negroes
do
not
like
to
be
designated
as
Negroes
in
the
press
.

I
should
like
to
underline
four
points
I
made
in
my
first
report
with
respect
to
vocational
education
.

Those
who
,
because
of
population
mobility
and
the
reputed
desire
of
employers
to
train
their
own
employees
,
would
limit
vocational
education
to
general
rather
than
specific
skills
ought
to
bear
in
mind
the
importance
of
motivation
in
any
kind
of
school
experience
.

Practically
all
of
these
practical
skills
are
of
such
a
nature
that
a
degree
of
mastery
can
be
obtained
in
high
school
sufficient
to
enable
the
youth
to
get
a
job
at
once
on
the
basis
of
the
skill
.

To
be
sure
,
in
tool-and-die
work
and
in
the
building
trades
,
the
first
job
must
be
often
on
an
apprentice
basis
,
but
two
years
of
half-time
vocational
training
enables
the
young
man
thus
to
anticipate
one
year
of
apprentice
status
.

Most
of
our
largest
cities
have
one
or
more
separate
vocational
or
technical
high
schools
.

Oh
,
he'll
be
a
plumber
,
came
the
answer
.

He
has
very
good
connections
.

In
my
view
,
there
should
be
a
school
which
offers
significant
vocational
programs
for
boys
within
easy
reach
of
every
family
in
a
city
.

Ideally
these
schools
should
be
so
located
that
one
or
more
should
be
in
the
area
where
demand
for
practical
courses
is
at
the
highest
.

An
excellent
example
of
a
successful
location
of
a
new
vocational
high
school
is
the
Dunbar
Vocational
High
School
in
Chicago
.

Hardly
a
window
has
been
broken
since
Dunbar
first
was
opened
(
and
vandalism
in
schools
is
a
major
problem
in
many
slum
areas
)
.

The
physical
facilities
at
Dunbar
are
impressive
,
but
more
impressive
is
the
attitude
of
the
pupils
.

American
chemists
,
seeking
to
increase
exports
of
soybeans
,
have
adapted
modern
techniques
and
fermentation
methods
to
improve
their
use
in
such
traditional
Japanese
foods
as
tofu
and
miso
and
in
tempeh
of
Indonesia
.

About
90
percent
of
the
corn
used
in
the
United
States
is
fed
to
animals
.

More
than
half
of
the
sorghum
and
barley
seeds
we
produce
and
most
of
the
byproducts
of
the
milling
of
cereals
and
the
crushing
of
oilseeds
are
fed
to
livestock
.

More
than
200
million
tons
of
seeds
and
seed
products
are
fed
to
livestock
annually
in
the
United
States
.

Chief
among
the
seed
crops
grown
primarily
for
industrial
uses
are
the
oil-bearing
seeds
--
flax
,
castor
,
tung
(
nuts
from
the
China
wood-oil
tree
)
,
perilla
(
from
an
Oriental
mint
)
,
and
oiticica
(
from
a
Brazilian
tree
)
.

These
oils
develop
hard
,
smooth
films
when
they
dry
and
form
resinlike
substances
.

Almond
oil
,
another
nondrying
oil
,
was
once
used
extensively
in
perfumery
to
extract
flower
fragrances
.

Solid
fats
from
the
seeds
of
the
mahua
tree
,
the
shea
tree
,
and
the
coconut
palm
are
used
to
make
candles
in
tropical
countries
.

Seeds
are
a
main
source
of
starch
for
industrial
and
food
use
in
many
parts
of
the
world
.

Quince
seed
gum
is
the
main
ingredient
in
wave-setting
lotions
.

The
kernels
of
brazil
nuts
,
cashews
,
coconuts
,
filberts
,
hazelnuts
,
hickory
nuts
,
pecans
,
walnuts
,
and
pine
nuts
are
predominantly
oily
.

Almonds
and
pistachio
nuts
are
not
so
high
in
oil
but
are
rich
in
protein
.

The
world
production
of
familiar
seed
nuts
--
almonds
,
brazil
nuts
,
filberts
,
and
the
English
walnuts
--
totals
about
300
thousand
tons
annually
.

The
oil
palm
of
West
Africa
yields
edible
oil
from
both
the
flesh
and
the
seed
or
kernel
of
its
fruit
.

A
forest
crop
that
has
not
been
extensively
cultivated
is
ivory
nuts
from
the
tagua
palm
.

The
so-called
vegetable
ivory
is
the
hard
endosperm
of
the
egg-sized
seed
.

Bead
tree
seeds
are
the
necklaces
of
South
Pacific
islanders
and
the
eyes
of
Buddha
dolls
in
Cuba
.

Victorian
ladies
had
a
fad
of
stringing
unusual
seeds
to
wear
as
jewelry
.

Tradition
has
assigned
medicinal
values
to
seeds
because
of
their
alkaloids
,
aromatic
oils
,
and
highly
flavored
components
.

Yet
there
were
always
some
that
moved
farther
and
farther
out
,
seekin'
grass
and
water
.

These
became
strays
,
the
term
bein'
restricted
to
cattle
,
however
,
as
hosses
,
under
like
circumstances
,
were
spoken
of
as
stray
hosses
,
not
merely
strays
.

but
when
a
large
number
were
bunched
up
or
banded
up
,
and
marched
away
from
their
home
range
,
as
long
as
they
stayed
together
the
group
was
said
to
be
a
drift
.

The
wholesale
death
of
cattle
as
a
result
of
blizzards
,
and
sometimes
droughts
,
over
a
wide
range
of
territory
was
called
a
die-up
.

When
cattle
in
winter
stopped
and
humped
their
backs
up
they
were
said
to
bow
up
.

Dry
stock
denoted
,
regardless
of
age
or
sex
,
such
bovines
as
were
givin'
no
milk
.

A
general
classification
given
grass-fed
cattle
was
grassers
.

When
a
cowboy
spoke
of
dustin'
a
cow
,
he
meant
that
he
throwed
dust
into
her
eyes
.

Tailin'
was
the
throwin'
of
an
animal
by
the
tail
in
lieu
of
a
rope
.

Though
the
slightest
yank
was
frequently
capable
of
producin'
results
,
many
men
assured
success
through
a
turn
of
the
tail
'bout
the
saddle
horn
,
supplemented
sometimes
,
in
the
case
of
cattle
,
by
a
downward
heave
of
the
rider's
leg
upon
the
strainin'
tail
.

When
cattle
became
more
valuable
,
ranch
owners
frowned
upon
this
practice
and
it
was
discontinued
,
at
least
when
the
boss
was
'round
.

Rammin'
one
horn
of
a
downed
steer
into
the
ground
to
hold
'im
down
was
called
peggin'
.

A
lineback
was
an
animal
with
a
stripe
of
different
color
from
the
rest
of
its
body
runnin'
down
its
back
,
while
a
lobo
stripe
was
the
white
,
yeller
,
or
brown
stripe
runnin'
down
the
back
,
from
neck
to
tail
,
a
characteristic
of
many
Spanish
cattle
.

Such
an
animal
was
said
to
be
mealynosed
.

The
northern
cowboy
called
all
the
red
Mexican
cattle
which
went
up
the
trail
Sonora
reds
,
while
they
called
all
cattle
drove
up
from
Mexico
yaks
,
because
they
came
from
the
Yaqui
Injun
country
,
or
gave
'em
the
name
of
Mexican
buckskins
.

Yeller
bellies
were
cattle
of
Mexican
breed
splotched
on
flank
and
belly
with
yellerish
color
.

Such
an
animal
has
frequently
been
the
downfall
of
the
rustler
.

The
counters
rode
through
the
pasture
countin'
each
bunch
of
grazin'
cattle
,
and
drifted
it
back
so
that
it
didn't
get
mixed
with
the
uncounted
cattle
ahead
.

No
matter
by
what
name
cattle
were
called
,
there
was
no
denyin'
that
they
not
only
saved
Texas
from
financial
ruin
,
but
went
far
toward
redeemin'
from
a
wilderness
vast
territories
of
the
Northwest
.

21
swingin'
a
wide
loop

Eventually
herdin'
the
hosses
was
spoken
of
as
hoss
rustlin'
,
and
the
wrangler
was
called
the
hoss
rustler
.

That's
the
Colonel
,
he
said
,
But
I
can't
see
the
dogs
.

Then
they
picked
up
the
smaller
black
specks
on
the
plain
in
front
of
him
.

Not
yet
,
cautioned
Ulyate
.

Then
there
was
a
chorus
of
wild
barking
and
baying
.

Then
the
heavy
roar
of
a
lion
.

It
came
from
the
top
of
the
Reef
not
half
a
mile
away
.

Ulyate
and
Kearton
climbed
on
toward
the
sound
of
the
barking
of
the
dogs
and
the
sporadic
roaring
of
the
lion
,
till
they
came
,
out
of
breath
,
to
the
crest
,
and
peering
through
the
branches
of
a
bush
,
this
is
what
Ulyate
saw
:
Jones
who
had
apparently
(
and
actually
had
)
ridden
up
the
nearly
impassable
hillside
,
sitting
calmly
on
his
horse
within
forty
feet
of
a
full-grown
young
lioness
,
who
was
crouched
on
a
flat
rock
and
seemed
just
about
to
charge
him
,
while
the
dogs
whirled
around
her
.

Why
she
doesn't
charge
him
,
I
don't
know
.

Jones
had
been
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
from
her
when
he
first
broke
through
to
the
top
of
the
Reef
.

(
In
the
graveyard
at
Nairobi
he
had
been
shown
the
graves
of
thirty-four
big
game
hunters
killed
hunting
the
animals
he
was
attempting
to
lasso
.

But
John
nipped
her
rear
end
--
one
lion's
rear
end
was
as
good
as
another
to
John
,
Africa
,
Arizona
no
matter
--
and
she
changed
ends
and
took
a
swipe
at
John
,
but
he
ducked
back
.

Jones
then
recoiled
his
rope
and
threw
again
,
this
time
hitting
her
on
the
back
but
failing
to
encircle
her
.

But
now
she
sank
lower
to
the
rock
.

She
was
rested
and
could
mount
a
charge
.

Just
the
tip
of
her
tail
was
moving
as
she
crouched
,
and
she
was
treading
lightly
up
and
down
with
her
hind
feet
.

Jones
yelled
,
or
she'll
kill
'em
all
.

For
such
an
emergency
he
had
included
Fourth-of-July
cannon
crackers
as
part
of
their
equipment
.

Lighting
one
he
pitched
it
into
the
crevice
,
and
the
lioness
left
off
mauling
the
dogs
and
departed
.

Ain't
she
a
beauty
,
though
?
?

Don't
you
go
a
step
nearer
her
than
I
do
,
Jones
warned
,
and
if
you
do
,
go
at
a
run
so
you'll
have
momentum
!
!

But
she
clung
to
the
rocks
and
brush
,
and
the
day
wore
away
.

Loveless
,
too
,
objected
.

It
won't
work
,
Colonel
.

They
tell
you
horses
go
crazy
at
the
sight
or
smell
of
a
bear
or
a
lion
,
but
these
didn't
.

Means
spit
and
edged
on
.

There
was
room
to
make
a
quick
dash
past
the
bush
and
throw
as
you
went
.

But
Means
kept
on
.

The
Christian
education
of
children
,
too
,
was
once
hardly
more
than
a
sideshow
,
but
the
day
came
when
a
congregation
that
did
not
assume
full
oversight
of
a
church
school
was
thought
of
as
failing
in
its
duty
.

As
things
now
stand
,
there
is
a
grievous
disparity
between
the
unity
in
Christ
which
we
profess
in
ecumenical
meetings
and
the
complacent
separateness
of
most
congregations
on
any
Main
Street
in
the
nation
.

The
crux
of
ecumenical
advance
is
an
even
more
personalized
matter
than
the
relation
between
congregations
in
the
same
community
.

It
is
here
that
the
local
and
ecumenical
must
meet
.

One
is
that
whatever
is
ecumenical
has
to
do
with
some
over-all
organization
at
the
top
and
needs
only
to
be
understood
at
the
so-called
lower
levels
.

The
truth
,
however
,
is
that
the
ecumenical
church
is
just
the
local
church
in
its
own
true
character
as
an
integral
unit
of
the
whole
People
of
God
throughout
the
world
.

The
basic
unit
in
the
church
,
of
whatever
denominational
polity
,
is
always
the
congregation
.

The
Jewish
synagogue
affords
a
parallel
to
the
Christian
congregation
,
but
Hinduism
,
Buddhism
,
Islam
,
Confucianism
,
Taoism
,
Shintoism
,
although
they
have
sacred
scriptures
,
priests
,
spiritual
disciplines
,
and
places
of
prayer
,
do
not
have
a
congregation
as
a
local
household
of
faith
and
love
.

Their
characteristic
experience
is
that
of
the
individual
at
an
altar
or
a
shrine
rather
than
that
of
a
continuing
social
group
with
a
distinctive
kind
of
fellowship
.

This
may
mean
having
fellowship
in
the
church
with
people
with
whom
,
on
the
level
of
merely
human
agreeableness
,
we
might
prefer
not
to
have
any
association
at
all
.

There
is
a
vast
difference
between
the
community
of
reconciliation
which
the
New
Testament
describes
and
the
community
of
congeniality
found
in
the
average
church
building
.

The
local
and
the
ecumenical
are
one
.

He
often
spoke
of
them
as
his
ecumenical
glasses
and
used
them
as
a
symbol
of
the
kind
of
vision
that
is
required
in
the
church
.

The
gap
between
the
ecumenical
perspective
and
the
parish
perspective
appears
most
starkly
in
a
church
in
any
of
our
comfortable
suburbs
.

It
is
growing
in
numbers
.

Its
people
are
agreeable
friends
.

It
is
not
stirring
them
to
confront
the
racial
tensions
of
today
with
the
mind
of
Christ
.

It
is
raising
no
disturbing
question
as
to
what
Christian
stewardship
means
for
the
relationship
of
the
richest
nation
in
the
world
to
economically
underdeveloped
peoples
.

To
put
it
bluntly
,
many
a
local
church
is
giving
its
members
only
what
they
consciously
want
.

There
is
a
humorous
but
revealing
story
about
a
rancher
who
owned
a
large
slice
of
Texas
and
who
wanted
to
have
on
it
everything
that
was
necessary
for
a
completely
pleasant
community
.

Why
,
no
,
ma'am
,
he
replied
,
this
church
belongs
to
me
!
!

Local
embodiment
of
the
whole

and
buggies
and
wagons
and
chugging
Fords
kept
gathering
all
morning
,
until
the
edges
of
the
field
were
packed
thick
and
small
boys
kept
scampering
out
on
the
playing
field
to
make
fun
of
the
visitors
--
whose
pitcher
was
a
formidable
looking
young
man
with
the
only
baseball
cap
.

This
was
typical
of
such
games
,
which
were
earnestly
played
to
win
and
practically
never
wound
up
in
an
expression
of
good
fellowship
.

When
the
visitors
,
after
losing
this
game
,
rode
along
the
village
streets
toward
home
,
the
youngsters
who
could
keep
abreast
of
them
for
a
moment
or
two
screamed
triumphantly
,
You
bunch
of
hay-shakers
!
!

Nearly
any
lad
with
a
modicum
of
skill
might
find
a
payday
awaiting
him
in
the
Three
I
League
,
or
the
Pony
League
,
or
the
Coastal
Plains
League
,
or
the
fast
Eastern
League
,
if
not
indeed
in
one
of
the
hundreds
of
city
leagues
that
abounded
everywhere
.

Even
a
city
of
thirty
thousand
might
have
six
baseball
teams
,
sponsored
by
grocers
and
hardware
merchants
or
department
stores
,
that
played
two
or
three
times
a
week
throughout
the
summer
,
usually
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
,
before
an
earnest
and
partisan
audience
who
did
not
begrudge
a
quarter
each
,
or
even
more
,
to
be
dropped
into
a
hat
when
the
game
was
half
over
.

But
the
nickname
never
stuck
and
Gehrig
was
no
match
for
Ruth
in
color
--
which
is
sometimes
a
polite
word
for
delinquent
behavior
on
and
off
the
field
.

There
were
others
who
climbed
flagpoles
and
refused
to
come
down
;
;

or
who
ingested
strange
objects
,
like
live
fish
;
;

or
who
essayed
to
down
full
bottles
of
illicit
gin
without
pausing
for
breath
.

Boston
fans
sometimes
liked
to
wring
some
wry
satisfaction
out
of
the
fact
that
most
of
the
great
1923-27
crew
were
graduates
of
the
Red
Sox
--
sold
to
millionaires
Huston
and
Ruppert
by
a
man
who
could
not
deny
them
their
most
trifling
desire
.

But
there
is
one
small
episode
that
a
few
New
York
fans
who
happened
to
sit
in
the
cheap
seats
for
one
World's
Series
game
in
1926
like
best
to
recall
.

The
ball
lay
there
,
shining
white
on
the
grass
in
view
of
nearly
every
fan
in
the
park
while
Ruth
,
red-necked
with
frustration
,
charged
about
the
small
patch
of
ground
screaming
,
Where's
the
--
-ing
ball
?
?

This
had
a
pleasant
effect
upon
the
Sunday
gate
receipts
as
well
as
upon
the
intake
of
the
rail
and
bus
companies
,
some
of
which
began
to
offer
special
excursion
rates
,
including
seats
at
the
park
,
just
as
the
trolley
and
ferry
companies
had
when
baseball
was
new
.

The
questions
women
asked
at
baseball
games
were
standard
grist
for
amateur
comedy
,
as
were
the
doings
of
women
automobile
drivers
;
;

for
every
grown
man
(
except
a
few
who
were
always
suspected
of
being
shy
on
virility
)
knew
at
least
the
fundamentals
of
baseball
,
just
as
every
male
American
in
this
era
liked
to
imagine
(
or
pretend
)
that
he
could
fight
with
his
fists
.

Women
actually
began
to
appear
unaccompanied
in
the
stands
,
where
they
still
occasionally
ran
the
risk
of
coming
home
with
a
tobacco-juice
stain
on
a
clean
skirt
or
a
new
curse
word
tingling
their
ears
.

The
radio
broadcasts
themselves
were
often
so
patiently
informative
,
despite
the
baseball
jargon
,
that
girls
and
women
could
begin
to
store
up
in
their
minds
the
same
sort
of
random
and
meaningless
statistics
that
small
boys
had
long
learned
better
than
they
ever
did
their
lessons
in
school
.

This
conclusion
is
dependent
on
the
assumption
that
traditional
sex
mores
will
continue
to
sanction
both
premarital
chastity
as
the
ideal
,
and
the
double
standard
holding
females
primarily
responsible
for
preserving
the
ideal
.

Our
discussion
does
not
utilize
all
the
identity
crises
postulated
by
Erikson
,
but
is
intended
to
demonstrate
the
utility
of
his
theoretical
schema
for
studying
unwed
mothers
.

The
adolescent
experiences
identity
crises
in
terms
of
time
perspective
vs.
time
diffusion
.

For
many
of
these
unwed
mothers
,
the
data
on
their
family
life
and
early
childhood
experiences
revealed
several
indications
and
sources
of
their
basic
mistrust
of
their
parents
in
particular
and
of
the
world
in
general
.

However
,
as
Erickson
has
noted
,
the
individual's
failure
to
develop
preliminary
identities
during
infancy
and
childhood
need
not
be
irreversibly
deterministic
with
respect
to
a
given
area
of
identity
diffusion
in
his
(
or
her
)
adolescence
.

In
the
specific
case
of
time
diffusion
,
we
must
emphasize
the
significance
of
the
earlier
development
of
mistrust
when
it
is
combined
with
the
inevitable
time
crisis
experienced
by
most
(
if
not
all
)
adolescents
in
our
society
,
and
with
the
failure
of
the
adolescent
period
to
provide
opportunities
for
developing
trust
.

Her
ostensible
indifference
to
and
rebellion
against
suggestions
and
criticisms
by
anyone
except
peer
friends
during
adolescence
are
the
manifestations
,
in
her
adolescence
,
of
her
having
been
indoctrinated
in
childhood
to
feel
shame
,
if
not
guilt
,
for
failing
to
behave
in
a
manner
acceptable
to
,
and
judged
by
,
the
performance
of
her
nursery-
and
elementary-school
peer
friends
.

The
developmental
process
involves
the
individual's
progressively
experiencing
a
sense
of
dignity
and
achievement
resulting
from
having
completed
tasks
,
having
kept
commitments
,
and
having
created
something
(
however
small
or
simple
--
even
a
doll
dress
of
one's
own
design
rather
than
in
the
design
it
ought
to
be
)
.

These
childhood
experiences
are
sources
of
the
self-certainty
that
the
adolescent
needs
,
for
experimenting
with
many
roles
,
and
for
the
freedom
to
fail
sometimes
in
the
process
of
exploring
and
discovering
her
skills
and
abilities
.

This
paralysis
may
be
expressed
in
the
female's
starting
--
and
never
completing
--
many
jobs
,
tasks
,
and
courses
of
study
;
;

Childhood
experiences
in
learning
work
and
self-discipline
habits
within
a
context
of
developing
autonomy
and
initiative
have
considerable
significance
for
the
prevention
of
illegitimacy
.

The
excerpts
from
case
histories
presented
above
confirm
this
significance
,
though
through
different
facets
of
experience
.

they
subsequently
occupied
their
leisure
hours
in
searching
for
something
exciting
and
diverting
.

In
discussing
the
ways
this
crisis
is
germane
to
consderations
for
the
prevention
of
illegitimacy
,
we
shall
again
superimpose
Erikson's
concept
on
our
data
.

A
pronounced
ideological
diffusion
--
i.e.
,
inability
to
identify
independently
with
given
ideas
and
value
systems
--
is
reflected
in
many
ways
.

In
the
adult
world
,
there
are
a
number
of
rather
general
and
diffuse
sources
of
ideological
diffusion
that
further
compound
the
adolescent's
search
for
meaning
during
this
particular
identity
crisis
.

For
example
,
some
contemporary
writing
tends
to
fuse
the
good
guys
and
the
bad
guys
,
to
portray
the
weak
people
as
heroes
and
weakness
as
a
virtue
,
and
to
explain
(
or
even
justify
)
asocial
behavior
by
attributing
it
to
deterministic
psychological
,
familial
,
and
social
experiences
.

the
duplication
of
testimony
and
exhibits
;
;

Its
costive
deliberations
were
likened
to
those
of
the
British
courts
of
chancery
mercilessly
caricatured
by
Dickens
in
Bleak
House
.

Parker
,
who
agreed
with
much
of
this
criticism
,
did
not
conceal
his
dissatisfaction
with
procedural
defects
.

Parker
insisted
that
the
size
of
the
record
would
have
been
drastically
reduced
but
for
an
unavoidable
duplication
of
testimony
.

The
fluidity
and
momentum
of
the
young
industry
abetted
a
general
disregard
of
patent
claims
.

Its
positive
features
outweighed
the
fact
that
the
pool
was
an
adjunct
of
a
wouldbe
monopoly
.

By
1910
the
courts
were
crowded
with
cases
,
many
of
them
brought
by
freebooters
who
trafficked
in
disputed
inventions
.

The
prevailing
view
in
the
industry
was
summed
up
in
1912
by
a
group
of
auto
makers
who
told
a
Senate
committee
:
The
exceedingly
unsatisfactory
and
uselessly
expensive
conditions
,
including
delays
surrounding
legal
disputes
,
particularly
in
patent
litigation
,
are
items
of
industrial
burden
which
must
be
written
large
in
figures
of
many
millions
of
dollars
of
industrial
waste
.

to
the
piazza
Navona
and
pantheon

You
will
walk
some
of
the
narrow
,
old
streets
,
hemmed
in
by
massive
palazzi
.

Andrea
Palladio
,
an
Italian
architect
of
the
sixteenth
century
,
modeled
his
designs
on
its
Doric
and
Ionic
columns
.

Wander
past
the
three
superb
Columns
of
Apollo
by
the
arches
of
the
theatre
.

It's
typical
of
Rome
that
in
the
midst
of
this
rather
poor
area
you
should
find
such
an
artistic
work
in
the
center
of
a
little
square
.

The
figures
have
been
executed
so
skillfully
that
one
senses
a
great
feeling
of
life
and
movement
.

Keep
straight
ahead
on
the
Via
Falegnami
,
cross
the
wide
Via
Arenula
,
and
you
will
come
to
the
Piazza
B.
Cairoli
,
where
you
should
look
in
at
the
Church
of
San
Carlo
Ai
Catinari
to
see
the
frescoes
on
the
ceiling
.

Michelangelo
was
the
most
distinguished
of
several
noted
architects
who
helped
design
it
.

In
the
Piazza
Navona
there
are
many
delightful
cafes
where
you
can
sit
,
have
a
drink
or
lunch
,
and
watch
the
fountains
in
the
square
.

The
scene
before
you
is
indeed
theatrical
and
often
appears
in
movies
about
Rome
.

Inside
you
will
find
the
lovely
Sibyls
painted
by
Raphael
and
a
chapel
designed
by
Michelangelo
.

in
a
moment
cross
the
Corso
Del
Rinascimento
.

)
The
curve
of
faded
terra-cotta-colored
houses
in
front
of
the
church
seems
like
a
stage
set
.

This
is
one
of
the
most
charming
little
squares
in
this
part
of
Rome
.

Horse
races

in
the
Middle
Ages

Here
is
your
opportunity
to
see
the
inside
of
a
palazzo
where
the
family
still
lives
.

Otherwise
,
cross
over
the
Corso
and
walk
a
block
or
so
to
the
left
.

You
will
come
to
Alemagna
,
a
delightful
,
though
moderately
expensive
restaurant
,
which
is
particularly
noted
for
its
exceptional
selection
of
ice
creams
and
patisseries
.

To
the
Spanish
steps

The
second
walk
through
the
heart
of
Rome
should
be
taken
after
lunch
,
so
that
you
will
reach
the
Pincian
Hill
when
the
soft
light
of
the
late
afternoon
is
at
its
best
.

Any
street
meeting
,
sacred
or
secular
,
which
he
and
his
colleagues
uneasily
cover
has
as
its
explicit
or
implicit
burden
the
cruelty
and
injustice
of
the
white
domination
.

The
white
policeman
standing
on
a
Harlem
street
corner
finds
himself
at
the
very
center
of
the
revolution
now
occurring
in
the
world
.

One
day
,
to
everyone's
astonishment
,
someone
drops
a
match
in
the
powder
keg
and
everything
blows
up
.

What
happened
is
that
Negroes
want
to
be
treated
like
men
.

My
recital
disturbed
him
and
made
him
indignant
;
;

The
white
people
fall
back
bitterly
before
the
black
horde
;
;

and
what
has
once
been
a
neighborhood
turns
into
a
turf
.

They
seem
to
feel
that
because
they
fought
on
the
right
side
during
the
Civil
War
,
and
won
,
they
have
earned
the
right
merely
to
deplore
what
is
going
on
in
the
South
,
without
taking
any
responsibility
for
it
;
;

and
that
they
can
ignore
what
is
happening
in
Northern
cities
because
what
is
happening
in
Little
Rock
or
Birmingham
is
worse
.

This
perpetual
justification
empties
the
heart
of
all
human
feeling
.

As
far
as
the
color
problem
is
concerned
,
there
is
but
one
great
difference
between
the
Southern
white
and
the
Northerner
:
the
Southerner
remembers
,
historically
and
in
his
own
psyche
,
a
kind
of
Eden
in
which
he
loved
black
people
and
they
loved
him
.

Everything
,
thereafter
,
is
permitted
him
except
the
love
he
remembers
and
has
never
ceased
to
need
.

Neither
the
Southerner
nor
the
Northerner
is
able
to
look
on
the
Negro
simply
as
a
man
.

Walk
through
the
streets
of
Harlem
and
see
what
we
,
this
nation
,
have
become
.

Nor
was
it
long
,
naturally
,
before
prominent
Negroes
rushed
forward
to
assure
the
republic
that
the
U.N.
rioters
do
not
represent
the
real
feeling
of
the
Negro
community
.

I
find
this
view
amazing
.

Their
presence
is
not
as
frightening
as
the
discontent
which
creates
their
opportunity
.

1935

;

Despite
the
sheer
beauty
and
spectacle
of
numerous
documentaries
,
art
films
,
and
travelogues
,
despite
the
impressive
financial
success
of
such
a
recent
development
as
Cinerama
,
the
movies
are
at
heart
a
form
of
fiction
,
like
the
play
,
the
novel
,
or
the
short
story
.

So
is
the
time
of
the
novel
.

The
time
of
the
motion
picture
is
fixed
absolutely
.

the
cinematic
element
of
time
is
merely
used
to
increase
the
realism
of
an
object
which
would
still
be
reasonably
realistic
in
a
still
photo
.

Almost
everything
about
the
movies
that
is
peculiarly
of
the
movies
derives
from
a
tension
created
and
maintained
between
narrative
time
and
film
time
.

It
was
Porter
,
however
,
who
produced
the
very
first
movie
whose
name
has
lived
on
through
the
half
century
of
film
history
that
has
since
ensued
.

The
movie
was
The
Great
Train
Robbery
and
its
effects
on
the
young
industry
and
art
were
all
but
incalculable
.

The
Great
Train
Robbery
is
a
one-reel
film
.

As
a
finale
is
appended
a
close-up
of
one
of
the
band
taking
aim
and
firing
his
revolver
straight
at
the
audience
.

All
this
is
simple
enough
,
but
in
telling
the
story
Porter
did
two
important
things
that
had
not
been
done
before
.

The
plane
of
the
action
in
the
scene
is
not
parallel
with
the
plane
of
the
film
in
the
camera
or
on
the
screen
.

If
,
in
preparing
that
shot
for
the
inevitable
showing
to
your
friends
,
you
interrupt
the
sequence
to
paste
in
a
few
frames
of
the
child's
grandmother
watching
this
event
,
you
have
begun
to
be
an
artist
in
film
;
;

This
is
what
Porter
did
.

As
the
robbers
leave
the
looted
train
,
the
film
suddenly
cuts
back
to
the
station
,
where
the
telegrapher's
little
daughter
arrives
with
her
father's
dinner
pail
only
to
find
him
bound
on
the
floor
.

When
he
came
to
the
movies
--
more
or
less
by
accident
--
they
were
still
cheap
entertainment
capable
of
enthralling
the
unthinking
for
an
idle
few
minutes
.

In
general
,
religious
interest
seems
to
exist
in
all
parts
of
the
metropolis
;
;

congregational
membership
,
however
,
is
another
thing
.

but
this
is
deceptive
,
for
the
core
of
membership
is
concentrated
in
a
single
social
and
economic
stratum
.

The
congregation
perishes
when
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
replenish
that
core
from
the
neighborhood
;
;

consequently
,
the
vulnerability
to
social
difference
should
not
be
attributed
to
the
stress
on
personal
community
in
Protestant
congregations
;
;

The
vulnerability
of
Protestantism
to
social
differences
stems
from
the
peculiar
role
of
the
new
religious
style
in
middle-class
life
,
where
the
congregation
is
a
vehicle
of
social
and
economic
group
identity
and
must
conform
,
therefore
,
to
the
principle
of
economic
integration
.

theologians
have
been
stressing
the
fact
that
the
Church
does
not
exist
for
its
own
sake
but
as
a
testimony
in
the
world
for
the
healing
of
the
world
.

the
new
people
respond
in
kind
by
joining
the
church
.

This
means
that
the
antennae
of
the
congregation
are
extended
into
the
community
,
picking
up
the
wave
lengths
of
those
who
will
fit
into
the
social
and
economic
level
of
the
congregation
;
;

the
lay
ministry
is
a
means
to
recruit
like-minded
people
who
will
strengthen
the
social
class
nucleus
of
the
congregation
.

The
inner
life
of
congregations
will
prosper
so
long
as
like-minded
people
of
similar
social
and
economic
level
can
fraternize
together
;
;

The
expense
of
this
type
of
organization
in
religious
life
,
when
one
recalls
the
number
of
city
churches
which
deteriorated
beyond
repair
before
being
abandoned
,
raises
fundamental
questions
about
the
principle
of
Protestant
survival
in
a
mobile
society
;
;

The
motifs
of
impersonal
interdependence
and
insulation
of
residential
communities
have
polarized
;
;

Consumer
communities
have
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
productive
interests
.

Soon
they
will
fight
their
way
into
the
lower
middle-class
suburbs
,
and
the
churches
will
experience
the
same
decay
and
rebuilding
cycle
which
has
characterized
their
history
for
a
century
.

Whatever
projection
one
makes
,
the
striking
fact
about
congregational
and
parochial
life
is
the
extent
to
which
it
is
a
vehicle
of
the
social
identity
of
middle-class
people
.

Attention
will
be
given
in
the
next
chapter
to
the
style
of
association
in
the
denominational
churches
;
;

The
keynotes
of
this
style
are
activism
and
emphasis
on
achievements
in
gaining
self-esteem
.

What
goes
on
in
the
cage
will
occupy
our
attention
under
the
rubric
of
the
organization
church
.

The
perplexing
question
still
remains
as
to
why
the
middle
classes
turn
to
the
churches
as
a
vehicle
of
social
identity
when
their
clubs
and
charities
should
fill
the
same
need
.

These
concessionaires
traded
where
they
wished
and
generally
dealt
with
the
Indians
through
engages
,
who
might
be
habitants
,
voyageurs
,
or
even
soldiers
.

Traders
from
the
English
colonies
were
far
more
generous
,
and
Indian
loyalty
turned
to
them
.

It
was
hoped
that
to
this
post
would
flow
a
large
quantity
of
furs
from
the
west
,
principally
down
the
Arkansas
River
.

Concessionaires
were
to
be
under
the
supervision
of
the
directors
.

The
habitants
were
to
be
encouraged
to
trade
and
were
to
dispose
of
their
pelts
to
the
concessionaires
.

Only
two
principal
storehouses
were
actually
established
--
one
at
Mobile
,
the
other
at
New
Orleans
.

Bienville
realized
that
if
the
French
were
to
hold
the
southeastern
tribes
against
the
enticements
of
British
goods
,
French
traders
must
be
able
to
offer
a
supply
as
abundant
as
the
Carolinians
and
at
reasonable
prices
.

Although
he
incited
a
few
friendly
Indians
to
pillage
the
invaders
,
and
even
kill
some
of
them
,
the
Carolina
advance
continued
.

Perier
attempted
to
understand
the
problem
by
sending
agents
to
inquire
among
the
Indians
.

They
were
to
conciliate
the
unfriendly
savages
,
and
,
wherever
possible
,
to
incite
the
natives
to
pillage
the
traders
from
Carolina
.

So
hostile
did
these
factions
become
that
,
among
the
Choctaws
,
civil
war
broke
out
.

Perier
finally
,
in
one
last
bid
in
1730
,
cut
the
price
of
goods
to
an
advance
of
40
per
cent
above
the
cost
in
France
.

The
King
accepted
the
surrender
and
fixed
the
compensation
of
the
company
at
1,450,000
livres
.

These
men
were
without
capital
or
experience
.

Perier
and
Salmon
,
the
intendant
,
wished
either
to
entrust
the
trade
to
an
association
of
merchants
or
to
have
the
crown
furnish
goods
on
credit
to
individuals
who
would
repay
their
debts
with
pelts
.

He
reported
,
too
,
that
among
the
habitants
there
were
none
of
probity
and
ability
sufficient
to
justify
entrusting
them
with
the
King's
goods
.

He
did
find
some
to
trust
,
however
,
and
he
employed
the
King's
soldiers
to
trade
.

They
would
not
be
pleased
to
have
it
published
back
home
that
they
planned
a
frolic
in
Paris
or
Hong
Kong
at
the
Treasury's
expense
.

Few
things
are
more
perilous
for
the
State
Department
than
a
displeased
congressman
.

Will
not
the
righteous
congressman
be
cheered
at
the
polls
if
he
reminds
them
to
get
right
with
America
and
if
he
saves
the
taxpayer
some
money
by
spoiling
a
few
of
their
schemes
?
?

The
chances
are
excellent
that
he
will
.

State
is
expected
to
arrange
the
touring
Cicero's
foreign
itinerary
;
;

its
embassies
are
expected
to
supply
him
with
reams
of
local
money
to
pay
his
way
;
;

The
congressman
who
,
in
Paris
,
may
have
stuffed
his
wallet
with
enough
franc
notes
to
paper
the
roof
of
Notre-Dame
will
systematically
scream
that
a
$200
increase
in
entertainment
allowance
for
a
second
secretary
is
tantamount
to
debauchery
of
the
Treasury
.

Diplomats
stayed
up
nights
thinking
of
ways
to
attain
peaceful
coexistence
,
not
with
Nikita
Khrushchev
,
but
with
John
Rooney
.

With
its
power
to
investigate
,
the
Senate
can
paralyze
the
Secretary
by
keeping
him
in
a
state
of
perpetual
testimony
before
committees
,
as
it
did
with
Dean
Acheson
.

An
internal
police
operation
managed
by
Scott
McLeod
,
a
former
F.B.I.
man
installed
as
security
officer
upon
congressional
insistence
,
was
part
of
the
vengeance
.

In
any
event
,
the
example
of
Acheson's
trampling
by
the
Senate
did
not
encourage
Dulles
to
provoke
it
.

This
,
in
turn
,
brought
a
new
fashion
in
senatorial
criticism
as
the
Democrats
took
control
.

In
the
new
style
,
the
Department
was
berated
as
intellectually
barren
and
unable
to
produce
the
vital
ideas
needed
to
outwit
the
Russians
.

For
three
or
four
years
in
the
mid-1950's
,
this
complaint
was
heard
rumbling
up
from
the
Senate
floor
whenever
there
was
a
dull
legislative
afternoon
.

Other
embassies
cable
home
The
New
York
Times
without
changing
a
comma
.

When
Ambassador
Mikhail
Menshikov
took
it
over
in
1957
from
Georgi
Zaroubin
,
he
made
a
determined
effort
to
change
this
idea
.

To
everyone's
astonishment
he
seemed
no
more
like
the
run-of-the-mine
Russian
ambassador
than
George
Babbitt
was
like
Fyodor
Pavlovitch
Karamazov
.

Speeches
by
the
Soviet
ambassador
became
the
vogue
as
he
obliged
rural
Maryland
Rotarians
and
National
Press
Club
alike
.

His
English
was
usable
and
he
used
it
fearlessly
.

The
size
of
Saud's
family
was
still
being
debated
when
the
King
appeared
for
his
first
meeting
with
Eisenhower
.

Twenty-one
,
replied
the
sheik
.

The
reports
of
President
Nasser's
pledges
which
Hammarskjold
was
relaying
from
Cairo
to
Washington
became
increasingly
incomprehensible
to
other
diplomats
,
including
the
Israeli
Foreign
Minister
,
Mrs.
Golda
Meir
.

Of
course
,
most
toilets
are
Eastern
style
--
at
floor
level
--
but
even
when
they
are
raised
to
chair
height
,
they
are
actually
outside
toilets
--
inside
.

Spiritual
life
is
cultivated
,
but
students
do
not
need
to
be
Christian
.

In
the
afternoon
Miss
Hosaka
and
her
mother
invited
me
to
go
with
them
and
young
Mrs.
Kodama
to
see
the
famous
Spring
dances
of
the
Geisha
dancers
.

She
was
a
real
experience
!
!

With
the
loss
of
the
Emperor
diety
in
Japan
,
the
people
are
left
in
confusion
with
no
God
or
moral
teachings
that
have
strength
.

There
seems
to
be
no
purpose
in
life
that
is
sure
--
no
certain
guiding
principles
to
give
stability
.

They
suggested
several
new
foods
,
and
usually
I
found
them
good
,
except
the
sweets
,
which
I
think
I
could
learn
to
like
.

After
a
day
at
Nikko
,
Mrs.
Kodama
put
me
on
the
train
for
Kyoto
.

My
instructions
were
that
Mr.
Nishimo
would
meet
me
at
the
hotel
,
but
instead
he
and
three
others
were
at
the
station
with
a
very
warm
welcome
.

My
hotel
rooms
on
the
trip
were
arranged
by
Masu
and
the
Japan
Travel
Bureau
and
were
more
elegant
than
I
would
have
chosen
,
but
it
was
fun
for
once
to
be
elegant
--
I
did
explain
to
the
students
,
however
,
that
this
was
not
my
usual
style
,
for
their
salaries
are
very
small
,
and
it
seemed
out
of
place
for
me
to
be
housed
so
well
.

Kyoto
is
the
ancient
capital
of
Japan
and
still
its
cultural
center
.

Here
I
was
accompanied
by
Mrs.
Okamoto
(
Fumio's
mother
)
,
her
son
,
Mr.
Washizu
(
a
prospective
student
with
whom
I
have
been
corresponding
for
more
than
a
year
)
,
and
Mr.
Nishima
,
one
of
the
science
teachers
.

We
visited
the
Okamoto
home
--
where
for
the
first
time
I
saw
the
famous
tea
ceremony
.

We
started
at
9
a.m.
to
visit
the
Kyoto
University
where
Mr.
Washizu
is
attending
.

We
had
tea
at
Mr.
Washizu's
home
where
I
learned
that
he
,
too
,
comes
from
a
very
wealthy
family
.

His
grandfather
is
a
Buddhist
priest
;
;

The
house
itself
is
400
years
old
with
all
the
craftsmanship
of
older
,
less-hurried
times
.

Mr.
Nishima
went
with
me
on
the
train
to
Nara
.

They
knew
that
I
was
still
grieving
over
the
tragic
event
,
and
they
felt
that
if
I
could
see
the
recovery
and
the
spirit
of
the
people
,
who
hold
no
grudge
,
but
who
also
regret
Pearl
Harbor
,
I
would
be
happier
and
would
understand
better
a
new
Japan
.

Our
Masu
is
one
of
the
very
few
architects
in
Japan
who
is
trying
to
plan
homes
around
family
functions
and
women's
needs
.

Many
of
the
features
of
the
homes
are
the
latest
modern
devices
in
American
homes
,
but
an
interesting
blend
of
cultures
finds
us
using
Japanese
artfulness
in
our
own
Western
architecture
at
the
same
time
that
the
Japanese
are
adopting
Western
utility
patterns
.

The
suppositions
in
the
previous
illustration
might
be
sufficiently
altered
by
establishing
a
connection
between
general
company
practice
and
local
practice
in
the
South
,
and
by
establishing
such
direct
connection
between
the
practice
and
the
economic
well-being
of
stores
located
in
New
York
and
general
company
policy
.

In
any
case
,
anyone
who
fails
to
make
significant
distinction
between
primary
and
secondary
applications
of
economic
pressure
would
in
principle
already
have
justified
that
use
of
economic
boycott
as
a
means
which
broke
out
a
few
years
ago
or
was
skillfully
organized
by
White
Citizens'
Councils
in
the
entire
state
of
Mississippi
against
every
local
Philco
dealer
in
that
state
,
in
protest
against
a
Philco-sponsored
program
over
a
national
TV
network
on
which
was
presented
a
drama
showing
,
it
seemed
,
a
high
yellow
gal
smooching
with
a
white
man
.

The
end
or
aim
of
the
action
,
of
course
,
is
also
important
,
especially
where
it
is
not
alone
a
matter
of
changing
community
customs
but
of
the
use
of
deadly
economic
power
to
intimidate
a
person
from
stepping
forward
to
claim
his
legal
rights
,
e.g.
,
against
Negroes
who
register
to
vote
in
Fayette
County
,
Tennessee
,
at
the
present
moment
.

It
is
clear
that
non-violent
resistance
is
a
mode
of
action
in
need
of
justification
and
limitation
in
Christian
morality
,
like
any
other
form
of
resistance
.

One
of
the
sit-in
leaders
has
said
:
Nobody
from
the
top
of
Heaven
to
the
bottom
of
Hell
can
stop
the
march
to
freedom
.

He
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
loses
the
moral
support
which
the
usual
violent
resistance
of
most
victims
would
render
him
;
;

This
makes
necessary
a
morality
of
means
,
and
principles
governing
the
conduct
of
resistance
whenever
this
is
thought
to
be
justified
.

A
technique
by
which
it
is
proposed
to
enter
with
compulsion
into
the
very
heart
of
a
man
and
determine
his
values
may
often
in
fact
seem
the
more
unlimited
aggression
.

Since
the
will
and
word
of
God
are
for
them
concentrated
in
Christ-like
love
,
it
seems
clear
to
them
that
non-violent
resistance
is
quite
another
thing
.

The
name
presumably
derives
from
the
French
royal
house
which
never
learned
and
never
forgot
;
;

Yet
paradoxically
my
liberal
friends
continue
to
view
Jefferson
as
one
of
their
patron
saints
.

When
I
question
them
as
to
what
they
mean
by
concepts
like
liberty
and
democracy
,
I
find
that
they
fall
into
two
categories
:
the
simpler
ones
who
have
simply
accepted
the
shibboleths
of
their
faith
without
analysis
;
;

This
seems
like
an
attitude
favoring
a
sort
of
totalitarian
bureaucracy
which
,
under
a
President
of
the
same
stamp
,
would
try
to
coerce
an
uncooperative
Congress
or
Supreme
Court
.

As
for
states'
rights
,
they
have
never
counted
in
the
thinking
of
my
liberal
friends
except
as
irritations
of
a
minor
and
immoral
nature
which
exist
now
only
as
anachronisms
.

Theirs
is
no
mere
lack
of
sympathy
,
but
something
closer
to
the
passionate
hatred
that
was
directed
against
Fascism
.

But
in
our
case
--
and
neither
my
wife
nor
I
have
extreme
views
on
integration
,
nor
are
we
given
to
emotional
outbursts
--
the
situation
has
ruined
one
or
two
valued
friendships
and
come
close
to
wrecking
several
more
.

And
social
relations
arising
out
of
business
ties
impose
courtesy
,
if
not
sympathy
,
toward
resident
and
visiting
Northerners
.

I
never
heard
of
a
poll
being
taken
on
the
question
.

and
if
a
poll
had
been
taken
immediately
following
the
dispatch
of
troops
to
Little
Rock
I
believe
the
majority
would
have
been
for
the
Old
South
.

Old
attitudes
are
held
more
tenaciously
in
the
Tidewater
than
the
Piedmont
;
;

And
no
doubt
many
people
in
states
like
the
Carolinas
and
Georgia
,
which
were
among
the
most
Tory
in
sentiment
in
the
eighteenth
century
,
bitterly
regretted
the
revolt
against
the
Crown
.

Southern
resentment
has
been
over
the
method
of
its
ending
,
the
invasion
,
and
Reconstruction
;
;

their
fears
now
are
of
miscegenation
and
Negro
political
control
in
many
counties
.

And
this
,
in
effect
,
means
most
of
modern
America
.

The
situation
of
the
South
since
1865
has
been
unique
in
the
western
world
.

Regardless
of
rights
and
wrongs
,
a
population
and
an
area
appropriate
to
a
pre-World-War-
1
great
power
have
been
,
following
conquest
,
ruled
against
their
will
by
a
neighboring
people
,
and
have
had
imposed
upon
them
social
and
economic
controls
they
dislike
.

It
is
extraordinary
that
a
people
as
proud
and
warlike
as
Southerners
should
have
been
as
docile
as
they
have
.

There
is
much
truth
in
both
these
charges
,
and
not
many
Bourbons
deny
them
.

Most
of
them
sincerely
believe
that
the
Anglo-Saxon
is
the
best
race
in
the
world
and
that
it
should
remain
pure
.

Many
Northeners
believe
this
,
too
,
but
few
of
them
will
say
so
publicly
.

They
believe
that
if
the
South
had
been
let
alone
it
would
have
produced
a
civilization
superior
to
that
of
modern
America
.

That
any
sort
of
duty
was
owed
by
his
nation
to
other
nations
would
have
astonished
a
nineteenth-century
statesman
.

His
duty
was
to
his
sovereign
and
to
his
nation
,
and
an
extension
to
peoples
beyond
the
territorial
boundaries
was
not
to
be
contemplated
.

Social
Darwinism
was
able
to
stave
off
the
incipient
socialist
movement
until
well
into
the
present
century
.

It
is
noteworthy
that
the
majority
of
the
delegates
to
the
Congress
were
from
the
less
developed
,
former
colonial
nations
.

The
Rule
of
Law
,
historically
a
principle
according
everyone
his
day
in
court
before
an
impartial
tribunal
,
was
broadened
substantively
by
making
it
a
responsibility
of
government
to
promote
individual
welfare
.

For
better
or
for
worse
,
we
all
now
live
in
welfare
states
,
the
organizing
principle
of
which
is
collective
responsibility
for
individual
well-being
.

Whether
a
concept
analogous
to
the
principle
of
internal
responsibility
operates
in
a
nation's
external
relations
is
less
obvious
and
more
difficult
to
establish
.

Reference
to
two
other
concepts
--
nationalism
and
sovereignty
--
may
help
to
reveal
the
contours
of
the
new
principle
.

Today
,
as
new
nations
rise
from
the
former
colonial
empires
,
nationalism
is
one
of
the
hurricane
forces
loose
in
the
world
.

Operating
side
by
side
,
together
they
helped
shore
up
the
nation-state
.

Austin's
nineteenth-century
view
of
law
and
sovereignty
still
dominates
much
of
today's
legal
and
political
thinking
.

These
fundamental
ideas
--
the
indivisibility
of
sovereignty
and
its
dual
(
internal-external
)
aspects
--
still
remain
the
core
of
that
concept
of
ultimate
political
power
.

In
fact
,
however
,
both
principles
have
always
been
nebulous
and
loosely
defined
.

Is
there
a
different
reality
behind
the
facade
?
?

The
short
answer
to
those
questions
is
yes
.

What
steps
have
been
taken
to
guard
against
the
one
sort
of
mishap
that
could
trigger
the
destruction
of
continents
?
?

Will
the
danger
increase
or
decrease
?
?

I
asked
the
same
questions
inside
the
launch-control
rooms
of
an
Atlas
missile
base
in
Wyoming
,
where
officers
who
wear
sidearms
are
manning
the
commit
buttons
that
could
start
a
war
--
accidentally
or
by
design
--
and
in
the
command
centers
where
other
pistol-packing
men
could
give
orders
to
push
such
buttons
.

Readiness
exercises
are
almost
continuous
.

Already
accidental
war
is
a
silent
guest
at
the
discussions
within
the
Kennedy
Administration
about
the
urgency
of
disarmament
and
nearly
all
other
questions
of
national
security
.

Only
recently
new
holes
were
discovered
in
our
safety
measures
,
and
a
search
is
now
on
for
more
.

Meanwhile
,
the
experts
speak
of
wars
triggered
by
false
pre-emption
,
escalation
,
unauthorized
behavior
and
other
terms
that
will
be
discussed
in
this
report
.

One
arm
represented
our
bombers
and
missiles
,
the
other
arm
theirs
.

Unanimously
they
believe
that
the
world
would
become
a
safer
place
if
more
of
us
--
and
more
Russians
and
Communist
Chinese
,
too
--
thought
about
accidental
war
.

to
the
SAC
command
and
control
post
,
forty-five
feet
below
the
ground
at
Offutt
Air
Force
Base
,
near
Omaha
,
Nebraska
;
;

Alternate
locations
exist
for
all
key
command
centers
.

And
no
messages
can
be
transmitted
on
these
circuits
until
senders
and
receivers
authenticate
in
advance
,
by
special
codes
,
that
the
messages
actually
come
from
their
purported
sources
.

He
makes
the
momentous
decision
.

Hundreds
of
men
are
required
to
pass
the
word
to
the
button
pushers
and
to
push
the
buttons
.

What
if
the
President
himself
,
in
the
language
of
the
military
,
goes
ape
?
?

Even
he
does
not
know
the
one
signal
for
a
nuclear
strike
--
the
go
code
.

The
talk
would
not
be
in
code
,
but
neither
would
it
ramble
.

Officers
who
participate
in
the
continual
practice
drills
assured
me
that
the
President's
decision
could
be
made
and
announced
on
the
gold
circuit
within
minutes
after
the
first
flash
from
Aj
.

If
communications
work
,
his
decision
would
be
instantly
known
in
all
command
posts
that
would
originate
the
actual
go
order
.

They
include
the
Navy's
Atlantic
Command
at
Norfolk
,
Virginia
,
which
is
in
contact
with
the
Polaris
subs
;
;

Air
Force
forward
headquarters
in
Europe
and
in
the
Pacific
,
which
control
tactical
fighters
on
ships
and
land
bases
;
;

Let
us
look
in
on
one
of
these
nerve
centers
--
SAC
at
Omaha
--
and
see
what
must
still
happen
before
a
wing
of
B-52
bombers
could
drop
their
Aj
.

In
a
word
,
plenty
.

Wisman
,
who
has
had
the
chief
controller's
job
for
four
years
,
calls
the
signals
for
a
team
operating
three
rows
of
dull-gray
consoles
studded
with
lights
,
switches
and
buttons
.

In
front
of
him
is
a
gold
phone
.

In
emergencies
the
SAC
commander
,
Gen.
Thomas
Power
,
or
his
deputies
and
their
staff
would
occupy
a
balcony
that
stretches
across
the
length
of
the
room
above
Wisman
and
his
staff
.

What
these
fragments
are
and
how
they
activate
the
go
order
may
not
be
revealed
.

I
asked
Wisman
what
would
happen
if
he
broke
out
the
go
codes
and
tried
to
start
transmitting
one
.

As
Wisman
put
it
,
They
have
separate
pieces
of
the
pie
,
and
we
have
the
whole
pie
.

Once
we
send
out
the
whole
pie
,
they
can
put
their
pieces
into
it
.

The
answer
is
a
cryptographic
secret
.

Unless
all
gadgets
are
properly
operated
--
and
the
wires
and
seals
from
the
handles
removed
first
--
no
damage
can
be
done
.

They
went
as
rigid
as
black
statuary
six
figures
,
lean
and
tall
and
angular
,
went
still
.

Such
stretches
have
an
inhuman
moonlike
quality
.

They
went
well-equipped
with
everything
except
knowledge
of
the
outback
country
.

The
countryside
looked
like
a
beautiful
open
park
with
gentle
slopes
and
soft
gray
tree-clumps
.

And
countless
others
like
them
have
died
.

The
family
at
the
boulder

Others
are
confined
to
vast
reservations
,
and
not
only
does
the
Australian
government
justifiably
not
wish
them
to
be
viewed
as
exhibits
in
a
zoo
,
but
on
their
reservations
they
are
extremely
fugitive
,
shunning
camps
,
coming
together
only
for
corroborees
at
which
their
strange
culture
comes
to
its
highest
pitch
--
which
is
very
low
indeed
.

It
was
a
difficult
and
ambiguous
kind
of
negotiation
,
even
though
the
rancher
was
said
to
be
expert
in
his
knowledge
of
the
aborigines
and
their
language
.

Do
you
always
navigate
like
this
?
?

Damned
right
,
he
said
.

I
would
try
to
memorize
landmarks
and
saw
in
a
half-hour
that
it
was
hopeless
.

Finally
we
approached
the
bivouac
of
the
aborigines
.

There
was
also
a
dog
,
a
dingo
dog
.

During
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
,
of
course
,
the
sun
comes
straight
down
and
there
isn't
any
shade
.

We
drove
close
to
the
boulder
,
stopped
the
Land
Rover
,
and
walked
over
toward
the
family
.

Every
bone
and
muscle
in
his
body
showed
,
but
he
did
not
give
the
appearance
of
starving
.

It
was
not
merely
that
flies
were
crawling
over
his
face
but
his
narrowed
eyelids
did
not
blink
when
the
flies
crawled
into
his
eye
sockets
.

Her
long
thin
arms
moved
in
a
slow
rhythmical
gesture
over
the
family
possessions
which
were
placed
in
front
of
her
.

There
were
two
rubbing
sticks
for
making
fire
,
two
stones
shaped
roughly
like
knives
,
a
woven-root
container
which
held
a
few
pounds
of
dried
worms
and
the
dead
body
of
some
rodent
.

They
had
located
the
runway
of
a
colony
of
ants
and
as
the
ants
came
out
of
the
ground
,
the
boys
picked
them
up
,
one
at
a
time
,
and
pinched
them
dead
.

The
odor
here
was
more
powerful
than
that
which
surrounded
the
town
aborigines
.

It
was
also
subtly
familiar
,
for
it
was
the
odor
of
the
human
body
,
but
multiplied
innumerable
times
because
of
the
fact
that
the
aborigines
never
bathed
.

At
the
corroborees
,
when
they
get
to
dancing
and
sweating
,
you'll
see
them
rubbing
up
against
a
man
who's
supposed
to
have
a
specially
good
smell
.

Here
,
Idje
,
you
fella
like
tabac
?
?

The
Afghans
invaded
;
;

the
Safavids
fell
from
power
;
;

Those
who
actually
get
there
find
that
it
isn't
spooky
at
all
but
as
brilliant
as
a
tile
in
sunlight
.

However
,
just
as
all
the
buildings
have
not
fallen
and
flowed
back
to
their
original
mud
,
so
the
values
which
wanted
them
and
saw
that
they
were
built
have
not
all
disappeared
.

they
are
the
places
where
Persians
live
.

And
of
course
religious
life
continues
to
center
in
the
more
famous
mosques
,
and
commercial
life
--
very
much
a
social
institution
--
in
the
bazaar
.

a
cigarette
would
taste
particularly
good
.

It
was
a
nice
day
,
granted
.

But
he
knew
;
;

It
was
to
provide
a
safe
and
spacious
crossing
for
these
caravans
,
and
also
to
make
a
pleasance
for
the
city
,
that
Shah
Abbas
2
,
in
about
1657
built
,
of
sun-baked
brick
,
tile
,
and
stone
,
the
present
bridge
.

From
upstream
it
looks
like
a
long
arcaded
box
laid
across
the
river
;
;

These
are
traversed
by
another
line
of
vaults
,
and
thus
rooms
,
arched
on
all
four
sides
,
are
formed
.

On
the
downstream
,
or
pavilion
,
side
these
vaults
give
out
onto
terraces
twice
as
wide
as
the
bridge
itself
.

Crowds
press
along
the
terraces
,
down
the
steps
,
in
and
out
of
the
arcades
,
massing
against
it
as
though
it
were
a
fortress
under
siege
.

Or
the
mode
of
love
to
this
fragment
by
a
recent
poet
:
Know
ye
,
fair
folk
who
dwell
on
earth
Or
shall
hereafter
come
to
birth
,
That
here
,
with
dust
upon
his
eyes
,
Iraj
,
the
sweet-tongued
singer
,
lies
.

Yet
within
this
limitation
there
is
an
astonishing
variety
:
design
as
intricate
as
that
in
the
carpet
or
miniature
,
with
the
melodic
line
like
the
painted
or
woven
line
often
flowing
into
an
arabesque
.

As
we
began
to
converse
in
the
lounge
of
his
Fifth
Avenue
hotel
,
his
restlessness
and
sensitivity
to
light
and
sound
became
immediately
apparent
.

Seeking
an
obscure
,
dark
,
relatively
quiet
corner
in
the
airy
room
otherwise
suffused
with
afternoon
sunshine
,
he
asked
if
the
soft
background
music
could
be
turned
off
.

Simultaneously
,
he
pursued
his
musical
studies
at
the
conservatory
,
receiving
sound
training
in
counterpoint
and
harmony
,
as
well
in
the
violin
and
piano
.

he
became
Otto
Klemperer's
personal
assistant
at
the
Cologne
Opera
,
and
a
year
later
was
promoted
to
the
position
of
regular
conductor
.

Wasn't
this
an
unusually
young
age
to
fill
such
a
responsible
post
?
?

Five
years
were
spent
with
the
Cologne
Opera
,
after
which
he
was
called
to
Prague
by
Alexander
von
Zemlinsky
,
teacher
of
Arnold
Schonberg
and
Erich
Korngold
.

Through
the
Frankfurt
Jewish
Kulturbund
he
began
to
give
sonata
recitals
in
synagogues
,
with
Cellist
Emanuel
Feuermann
.

In
1938
,
at
the
insistence
of
Arturo
Toscanini
,
Steinberg
left
Germany
for
the
United
States
,
by
way
of
Switzerland
.

In
1945
he
became
conductor
of
the
Buffalo
Philharmonic
.

Seven
years
later
he
was
asked
to
become
director
of
the
Pittsburgh
Symphony
.

In
recent
years
he
has
traveled
widely
in
Europe
,
conducting
in
Italy
,
France
,
Austria
,
and
Switzerland
.

Steinberg
spoke
with
warmth
and
enthusiasm
about
Italy
:
Rome
is
my
second
home
.

Then
I
return
to
the
United
States
for
engagements
at
the
Hollywood
Bowl
and
in
Philadelphia
,
he
added
.

There
will
be
premieres
of
new
works
,
made
possible
through
Ford
Foundation
commissions
:
Carlisle
Floyd's
Mystery
,
with
Phyllis
Curtin
as
soprano
soloist
.

He
recalled
that
in
California
after
a
critic
had
attacked
him
for
still
trying
to
sell
Bruckner
to
the
Americans
,
the
public's
response
at
the
next
concert
was
a
standing
ovation
.

I
consider
it
to
be
my
job
to
expose
the
public
to
what
is
being
written
today
.

He
was
not
enthusiastic
over
the
newly
acquired
Claude
Lorrain
,
but
reminisced
with
pleasure
over
a
Poussin
exhibit
he
had
been
able
to
see
in
Paris
a
year
ago
.

As
my
wife
puts
it
,
he
said
,
again
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
,
all
you
know
is
your
music
.

Like
his
late
colleague
,
Mitropoulos
,
he
reads
mystery
stories
,
in
particular
Sir
Arthur
Conan
Doyle
.

I
was
chairman
,
the
only
not
youthful
participant
.

It
is
easy
for
you
to
talk
;
;

countered
a
twenty
year
old
law
student
,
you
travel
around
the
world
.

We
would
like
to
do
that
too
.

The
debate
needed
no
additional
controversy
and
soon
I
could
ask
each
individually
what
he
expected
from
life
,
what
his
hopes
were
and
what
his
fears
.

In
certain
respects
,
their
task
was
incomparably
greater
than
ours
today
,
for
there
was
nobody
before
them
to
show
them
the
way
.

Even
though
in
most
cases
the
completion
of
the
definitive
editions
of
their
writings
is
still
years
off
,
enough
documentation
has
already
been
assembled
to
warrant
drawing
a
new
composite
profile
of
the
leadership
which
performed
the
heroic
dual
feats
of
winning
American
independence
and
founding
a
new
nation
.

The
young
printer's
apprentice
achieved
greatness
in
a
half-dozen
different
fields
,
as
editor
and
publisher
,
scientist
,
inventor
,
philanthropist
and
statesman
.

If
Franklin
was
an
authentic
genius
,
then
Alexander
Hamilton
,
with
his
exceptional
precocity
,
consuming
energy
,
and
high
ambition
,
was
a
political
prodigy
.

Principal
author
of
The
Federalist
,
he
swung
New
York
over
from
opposition
to
the
Constitution
to
ratification
almost
single-handedly
.

And
Hamilton
,
who
felt
it
a
religious
duty
to
oppose
Aaron
Burr's
political
ambitions
,
would
have
been
a
better
actuarial
risk
had
he
shown
more
literary
restraint
.

Washington
never
had
a
chance
to
work
for
an
extended
stretch
at
the
occupation
he
loved
best
,
plantation
management
.

Jay
had
participated
in
the
decision
that
exiled
his
old
friend
Van
Schaack
.

The
latter
in
turn
assured
him
that
were
I
arraigned
at
the
bar
,
and
you
my
judge
,
I
should
expect
to
stand
or
fall
only
by
the
merits
of
my
cause
.

All
sought
the
fruition
of
that
nationalism
in
a
Federal
Government
with
substantial
powers
.

The
state's
rights
position
was
formulated
by
Jefferson
and
Madison
in
the
Kentucky
and
Virginia
Resolves
,
but
in
their
later
careers
as
heads
of
state
the
two
proved
themselves
better
Hamiltonians
than
Jeffersonians
.

When
,
in
1832
,
the
South
Carolina
nullifiers
adopted
the
principle
of
state
interposition
which
Madison
had
advanced
in
his
old
Virginia
Resolve
,
they
elicited
no
encouragement
from
that
senior
statesman
.

In
his
political
testament
,
Advice
To
My
Country
,
penned
just
before
his
death
,
Madison
expressed
the
wish
that
the
Union
of
the
States
be
cherished
and
perpetuated
.

Such
writers
as
William
Faulkner
and
Robert
Penn
Warren
have
led
the
field
of
somewhat
less
important
writers
in
a
sort
of
post-bellum
renaissance
.

This
is
not
to
say
that
the
South
is
no
longer
agrarian
;
;

in
1950
it
had
become
47.1%
urban
.

As
the
New
South
snowballs
toward
further
urbanization
,
it
becomes
more
and
more
homogeneous
with
the
North
--
a
tendency
which
Willard
Thorp
terms
Yankeefication
,
as
evidenced
in
such
cities
as
Charlotte
,
Birmingham
,
and
Houston
.

It
is
said
that
,
even
at
the
present
stage
of
Southern
urbanization
,
such
a
city
as
Atlanta
is
not
distinctly
unlike
Columbus
or
Trenton
.

the
list
is
,
obviously
,
endless
.

Truman
Capote
is
still
reveling
in
Southern
Gothicism
,
exaggerating
the
old
Southern
legends
into
something
beautiful
and
grotesque
,
but
as
unreal
as
--
or
even
more
unreal
than
--
yesterday
.

William
Styron
,
while
facing
the
changing
economy
with
a
certain
uneasy
reluctance
,
insists
he
is
not
to
be
classified
as
a
Southern
writer
and
yet
includes
traditional
Southern
concepts
in
everything
he
publishes
.

such
are
simply
not
within
his
bounded
province
.

But
there
have
been
abrupt
changes
as
well
:
the
sit-ins
,
the
picket
lines
,
the
bus
strikes
--
all
of
these
were
unheard-of
even
ten
years
ago
.

It
is
clear
that
,
while
most
writers
enjoy
picturing
the
Negro
as
a
woolly-headed
,
humble
old
agrarian
who
mutters
yassuhs
and
sho'
nufs
with
blissful
deference
to
his
white
employer
(
or
,
in
Old
South
terms
,
massuh
)
,
this
stereotype
is
doomed
to
become
in
reality
as
obsolete
as
Caldwell's
Lester
.

Writers
openly
admit
that
the
Negro
is
easier
to
write
than
the
white
man
;
;

recently
only
Keith
Wheeler's
novel
,
Peaceable
Lane
,
has
openly
faced
the
problem
.

but
they
can
hardly
deny
that
,
exaggerated
or
not
,
the
old
panorama
is
dead
.

He
treats
it
with
a
mythological
,
universal
application
.

The
dancer
who
never
loosens
her
hold
on
a
parasol
,
begins
to
feel
that
it
is
part
of
herself
.

Some
painters
have
less
interest
in
the
experience
of
the
moment
,
with
its
attendant
urgencies
and
ambiguities
,
than
in
looking
beyond
the
flux
of
particular
impressions
to
a
higher
,
more
serene
level
of
truth
.

He
may
even
alter
the
pattern
by
applying
a
scheme
of
random
numbers
.

But
he
cannot
order
his
elements
by
will
,
either
rational
or
inspired
.

Again
,
the
composer
must
select
his
own
materials
.

Avant-garde
choreographers
,
seeking
new
forms
of
continuity
for
their
new
vocabulary
of
movements
,
have
turned
to
similar
approaches
.

Alwin
Nikolais
objects
to
art
as
an
outpouring
of
personal
emotion
.

It
may
establish
the
relation
of
the
figure
of
the
dancer
to
light
and
color
,
in
which
case
changes
in
the
light
or
color
will
set
off
a
kaleidescope
of
visual
designs
.

Unconcerned
with
the
practical
function
of
his
actions
,
the
dancer
is
engrossed
exclusively
in
their
motional
content
.

Movements
unfold
freely
because
they
are
uninhibited
by
emotional
bias
or
purposive
drive
.

Though
he
is
also
concerned
with
freeing
dance
from
pedestrian
modes
of
activity
,
Merce
Cunningham
has
selected
a
very
different
method
for
achieving
his
aim
.

Their
consequences
are
irrelevant
--
or
there
are
no
consequences
at
all
.

Each
performance
may
be
different
.

And
any
sequence
can
not
only
change
its
positions
in
the
work
but
can
even
be
eliminated
from
it
altogether
.

Mr.
Cunningham
tries
not
to
cheat
the
chance
method
;
;

Then
the
choreographer
must
arbitrate
.

He
must
construct
transitions
so
that
a
dancer
who
is
told
to
lie
prone
one
second
and
to
leap
wildly
the
next
will
have
some
physical
preparation
for
the
leap
.

The
people
everywhere
had
grown
meanwhile
in
devotion
to
basic
democratic
principles
,
in
understanding
of
and
belief
in
the
federal
balance
,
and
in
love
of
their
Union
.

The
present
issue
in
Atlantica
--
whether
to
transform
an
alliance
of
sovereign
nations
into
a
federal
union
of
sovereign
citizens
--
resembles
the
American
one
of
1787-89
rather
than
the
one
that
was
resolved
by
Civil
War
.

The
champions
of
the
Union
maintained
that
the
Constitution
had
formed
,
fundamentally
,
the
united
people
of
America
,
that
it
was
a
compact
among
sovereign
citizens
rather
than
states
,
and
that
therefore
the
states
had
no
right
to
secede
,
though
the
citizens
could
.

Writing
to
Speed
on
August
24
,
1855
,
Lincoln
made
the
latter
point
clear
.

The
Confederate
Constitution
copied
much
of
the
Federal
Constitution
verbatim
,
and
most
of
the
rest
in
substance
.

Many
believe
--
and
understandably
--
that
the
great
difference
between
the
Constitution
of
the
Southern
Confederacy
and
the
Federal
Constitution
was
that
the
former
recognized
the
right
of
each
state
to
secede
.

The
Constitution
of
the
Southern
Confederation
differed
from
that
of
the
Federal
Union
only
in
two
important
respects
:
It
openly
,
defiantly
,
recognized
slavery
--
an
institution
which
the
Southerners
of
1787
,
even
though
they
continued
it
,
found
so
impossible
to
reconcile
with
freedom
that
they
carefully
avoided
mentioning
the
word
in
the
Federal
Constitution
.

Confederate
Constitution
,
1861

If
the
Union
conceded
this
to
them
,
the
same
right
must
be
conceded
to
each
remaining
state
whenever
it
saw
fit
to
secede
:
This
would
destroy
the
federal
balance
between
it
and
the
states
,
and
in
the
end
sacrifice
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
all
the
liberty
the
citizens
had
gained
by
their
Union
.

Much
as
he
abhorred
slavery
,
Lincoln
was
always
willing
to
concede
to
each
slave
state
the
right
to
decide
independently
whether
to
continue
or
end
it
.

The
fact
that
the
Americans
who
upheld
the
sovereignty
of
their
states
did
this
in
order
to
keep
many
of
their
people
more
securely
in
slavery
--
the
antithesis
of
individual
liberty
--
made
the
conflict
grimmer
,
and
the
greater
.

But
before
this
came
about
,
214,938
Americans
had
given
their
lives
in
battle
for
the
two
concepts
of
the
sovereign
rights
of
men
and
of
states
.

The
very
fact
that
they
came
so
near
to
winning
by
the
wrong
method
,
war
,
led
directly
to
their
losing
both
the
war
and
the
wrong
thing
they
fought
for
,
since
it
forced
Lincoln
to
free
their
slaves
as
a
military
measure
.

There
was
a
divine
justice
in
one
wrong
thus
undoing
another
.

One
wonders
about
its
applicability
to
people
.

Will
advances
in
human
sciences
help
us
build
social
structures
and
governments
which
will
enable
us
to
cope
with
people
as
effectively
as
the
primitive
combination
of
protein
and
nucleic
acid
built
a
structure
of
molecules
which
enabled
it
to
adapt
to
a
sea
of
molecular
interaction
?
?

For
the
family
is
the
simplest
example
of
just
such
a
unit
,
composed
of
people
,
which
gives
us
both
some
immunity
from
,
and
a
way
of
dealing
with
,
other
people
.

Is
the
future
of
psychology
akin
to
the
rich
future
of
physics
at
the
time
of
Newton
?
?

Most
of
these
,
with
horrible
exceptions
,
were
conceived
as
is
a
ship
,
not
as
an
attempt
to
quell
the
ocean
of
mankind
,
nor
to
deny
its
force
,
but
as
a
means
to
survive
and
enjoy
it
.

The
most
effective
political
inventions
seem
to
make
maximum
use
of
natural
harbors
and
are
aware
that
restraining
breakwaters
can
play
only
a
minor
part
in
the
whole
scheme
.

They
are
in
general
those
fears
that
once
seemed
to
have
been
amenable
to
prayer
or
ritual
.

It
is
curious
that
even
centuries
of
repetition
of
the
yearly
cycle
did
not
induce
a
sufficient
degree
of
confidence
to
allow
people
to
abandon
the
ceremonies
of
the
winter
solstice
.

We
,
in
our
country
,
think
of
war
as
an
external
threat
which
,
if
it
occurs
,
will
not
be
primarily
of
our
own
doing
.

Our
collective
policies
,
group
and
national
,
are
similarly
based
on
voodoo
,
but
here
we
often
lack
even
the
empirically
successful
rituals
and
are
still
engaged
in
determing
them
.

The
achievements
which
dispelled
our
fears
of
the
cosmos
took
place
three
centuries
ago
.

The
major
effect
of
these
advances
appears
to
lie
in
the
part
they
have
played
in
the
industrial
revolution
and
in
the
tools
which
scientific
understanding
has
given
us
to
build
and
manipulate
a
more
protective
environment
.

In
addition
,
our
way
of
dealing
directly
with
natural
phenomena
has
also
changed
.

Apparently
the
population
as
a
whole
eventually
acquires
enough
confidence
in
the
explanations
of
the
scientists
to
modify
its
procedures
and
its
fears
.

In
some
areas
,
the
progress
is
slower
than
in
others
.

In
child
care
,
the
opposite
extreme
prevails
;
;

Much
of
the
former
extreme
uneasiness
associated
with
visions
and
hallucinations
and
with
death
has
disappeared
.

In
fact
,
the
recent
warnings
about
the
use
of
X-rays
have
introduced
fears
and
ambiguities
of
action
which
now
require
more
detailed
understanding
,
and
thus
in
this
instance
,
science
has
momentarily
aggravated
our
fears
.

The
fear
of
disease
was
formerly
very
much
the
kind
of
fear
I
have
tried
to
describe
.

His
letter
had
suggested
we
meet
at
my
hotel
at
noon
on
Sunday
,
and
I
came
into
the
lobby
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
.

American
newspaper
reviewers
like
to
call
his
plays
nihilistic
.

He
seems
,
by
some
unconscious
division
of
labor
,
to
have
given
them
that
one
function
and
no
other
,
leaving
communication
to
the
rest
of
the
face
.

His
talk
turns
to
what
he
calls
the
mess
,
or
sometimes
this
buzzing
confusion
.

We
cannot
listen
to
a
conversation
for
five
minutes
without
being
acutely
aware
of
the
confusion
.

I
suggested
that
one
must
let
it
in
because
it
is
the
truth
,
but
Beckett
did
not
take
to
the
word
truth
.

Then
he
began
to
speak
about
the
tension
in
art
between
the
mess
and
form
.

How
could
the
mess
be
admitted
,
because
it
appears
to
be
the
very
opposite
of
form
and
therefore
destructive
of
the
very
thing
that
art
holds
itself
to
be
?
?

How
,
I
asked
,
could
chaos
be
admitted
to
chaos
?
?

Would
not
that
be
the
end
of
thinking
and
the
end
of
art
?
?

Plays
more
highly
formalized
than
Waiting
For
Godot
,
Endgame
,
and
Krapp's
Last
Tape
would
be
hard
to
find
.

Is
this
life-death
question
a
part
of
the
chaos
?
?

If
there
were
only
darkness
,
all
would
be
clear
.

It
is
because
there
is
not
only
darkness
but
also
light
that
our
situation
becomes
inexplicable
.

Take
Augustine's
doctrine
of
grace
given
and
grace
withheld
:
have
you
pondered
the
dramatic
qualities
in
this
theology
?
?

In
classical
drama
,
such
problems
do
not
arise
.

He
knelt
down
at
his
bed
as
long
as
he
could
kneel
.

Irish
Catholicism
is
not
attractive
,
but
it
is
deeper
.

But
do
the
plays
deal
with
the
same
facets
of
experience
religion
must
also
deal
with
?
?

Some
people
object
to
this
in
my
writing
.

Then
he
thought
me
more
perverse
than
ever
.

I
left
the
party
as
soon
as
possible
and
got
into
a
taxi
.

The
personal
quality
of
Samuel
Beckett
is
similar
to
qualities
I
had
found
in
the
plays
.

but
there
is
also
compassion
.

As
a
writer
on
the
theater
,
I
have
paid
close
attention
to
the
plays
.

Waiting
For
Godot
sells
even
better
in
America
than
in
France
.

America
is
now
joining
Europe
in
this
mature
phase
of
development
.

Though
sex
in
some
form
or
other
enters
into
all
human
activity
and
it
was
a
good
thing
that
Freud
emphasized
this
aspect
of
human
nature
,
it
is
fantastic
to
explain
everything
in
terms
of
sex
.

But
for
the
beat
generation
all
is
sex
.

it
is
Astarte
,
Ishtar
,
Venus
,
Yahwe
,
Dionysus
,
Christ
,
the
mysterious
and
divine
orgone
energy
flowing
through
the
body
of
the
universe
.

They
withdraw
to
the
underground
of
the
slums
where
they
can
defy
the
precepts
of
legalized
propriety
.

Unlike
the
heroes
and
flappers
of
the
lost
generation
,
they
disdain
the
art
of
necking
and
petting
.

This
is
far
from
the
vulgar
,
leering
sexuality
of
the
middle-class
square
in
heat
.

This
is
the
Holy
Grail
these
knights
of
the
orgasm
pursue
,
this
is
the
irresistible
cosmic
urge
to
which
they
respond
.

In
addition
,
they
have
been
converted
to
Zen
Buddhism
,
with
its
glorification
of
all
that
is
natural
and
mysteriously
alive
,
the
sense
that
everything
in
the
world
is
flowing
.

And
Zen
Buddhism
,
though
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
understand
how
these
internal
contradictions
are
reconciled
,
helps
them
in
their
struggle
to
achieve
personal
salvation
through
sexual
release
.

Those
who
are
sexually
liberated
can
become
creatively
alive
and
free
,
their
instincts
put
at
the
service
of
the
imagination
.

Righteous
in
their
denunciation
of
all
that
makes
for
death
,
the
beat
prophets
bid
all
men
become
cool
cats
;
;

Apart
from
the
categorical
imperative
they
derive
from
the
metaphysics
of
the
orgasm
,
the
only
affirmation
they
are
capable
of
making
is
that
art
is
their
only
refuge
.

When
they
express
themselves
it
is
incandescent
hatred
that
shines
forth
,
the
rage
of
repudiation
,
the
ecstasy
of
negation
.

It
is
sex
that
obsesses
them
,
sex
that
is
at
the
basis
of
their
aesthetic
creed
.

One
girl
describes
her
past
,
her
succession
of
broken
marriages
,
the
abortions
she
has
had
and
finally
confesses
that
she
loves
sex
and
sees
no
reason
why
she
must
justify
her
passion
.

The
new
fact
the
initiates
of
this
cult
have
to
learn
is
that
they
must
move
toward
simplicity
.

They
embrace
independent
poverty
,
usually
with
a
shack-up
partner
who
will
help
support
them
.

One
beatnik
got
the
woman
he
was
living
with
so
involved
in
drugs
and
self-analysis
and
all-night
sessions
of
sex
that
she
was
beginning
to
crack
up
.

Everything
in
the
final
analysis
reduced
itself
to
sexual
symbolism
.

In
his
chapter
on
The
Loveways
Of
The
Beat
Generation
,
Lipton
spares
the
reader
none
of
the
sordid
details
.

Part
of
the
ritual
of
sex
is
the
use
of
marijuana
.

As
Lipton
puts
it
:
The
Eros
is
felt
in
the
magic
circle
of
marijuana
with
far
greater
force
,
as
a
unifying
principle
in
human
relationships
,
than
at
any
other
time
except
,
perhaps
,
in
the
mutual
metaphysical
orgasms
.

The
magic
circle
is
,
in
fact
,
a
symbol
of
and
preparation
for
the
metaphysical
orgasm
.

Carried
high
on
this
charge
,
he
composes
magical
poetry
that
captures
the
organic
rhythms
of
life
in
words
.

If
he
thus
achieves
a
lyrical
,
dreamlike
,
drugged
intensity
,
he
pays
the
price
for
his
indulgence
by
producing
work
--
Allen
Ginsberg's
Howl
is
a
striking
example
of
this
tendency
--
that
is
disoriented
,
Dionysian
but
without
depth
and
without
Apollonian
control
.

There
were
fences
in
the
old
days
when
we
were
children
.

Across
the
front
of
a
yard
and
down
the
side
,
they
were
iron
,
either
spiked
along
the
top
or
arched
in
half
circles
.

Side
fences
were
hidden
beneath
lilacs
and
hundred-leaf
roses
;
;

One
looked
down
on
a
sea
of
leaves
,
a
breaking
wave
of
flower
.

And
yet
--
a
year
to
a
child
is
an
eternity
,
and
in
the
memory
that
phase
of
one's
being
--
a
certain
mental
landscape
--
will
seem
to
have
endured
without
beginning
and
without
end
.

I
have
no
picture
in
my
mind
of
the
garden
as
a
whole
--
that
I
could
not
see
--
but
certain
aspects
of
certain
corners
linger
in
the
memory
:
wind-blown
,
frost-bitten
,
white
chrysanthemums
beneath
a
window
,
with
their
brittle
brown
leaves
and
their
sharp
scent
of
November
;
;

hot-colored
verbenas
in
the
corner
between
the
dining-room
wall
and
the
side
porch
,
where
we
passed
on
our
way
to
the
pump
with
the
half-gourd
tied
to
it
as
a
cup
by
my
grandmother
for
our
childish
pleasure
in
drinking
from
it
.

These
my
grandmother
left
in
their
places
(
they
are
still
there
,
more
persistent
and
longer-lived
than
the
generations
of
man
)
and
planted
others
like
them
,
that
flourished
without
careful
tending
.

Other
flowers
we
might
gather
as
we
pleased
:
myrtle
and
white
violets
from
beneath
the
lilacs
;
;

and
the
little
,
dark
blue
larkspur
that
scattered
its
seed
everywhere
.

More
potent
a
charm
to
bring
back
that
time
of
life
than
this
record
of
a
few
pictures
and
a
few
remembered
facts
would
be
a
catalogue
of
the
minutiae
which
are
of
the
very
stuff
of
the
mind
,
intrinsic
,
because
they
were
known
in
the
beginning
not
by
the
eye
alone
but
by
the
hand
that
held
them
.

red-and-yellow
columbines
whose
round-tipped
spurs
were
picked
off
and
eaten
for
the
honey
in
them
;
;

Dead
fledgling
birds
,
their
squashed-looking
nakedness
and
the
odor
of
decay
that
clung
to
the
hand
when
they
had
been
buried
in
our
graveyard
in
front
of
the
purple
flags
.

our
elders
stayed
in
the
dark
house
or
sat
fanning
on
the
front
porch
.

We
were
not
,
however
,
entirely
unacquainted
with
the
varying
aspects
of
the
street
.

Every
slight
sound
that
rose
against
that
pressure
fell
away
again
,
crushed
beneath
it
.

The
sun
moved
slant-wise
across
the
sky
and
down
;
;

he
tossed
a
paper
toward
every
front
door
,
and
housewives
came
down
to
their
steps
to
pick
them
up
and
read
what
their
neighbors
had
been
doing
.

His
appearance
as
Lizzy
evokes
not
amusement
but
horror
in
the
audience
;
;

The
horrifying
humor
,
the
specifically
sexual
embarrassment
of
the
joke
gone
wrong
,
the
monstrous
image
of
the
fat
man
dressed
up
as
a
whore
dressing
up
as
a
baby
;
;

The
release
,
the
freedom
,
involved
in
loving
another
is
either
terribly
difficult
or
else
absolutely
impossible
;
;

This
prohibition
on
love
has
an
especially
poignant
relation
to
art
;
;

it
is
particularly
the
artist
(
Tonio
Kroger
,
Aschenbach
,
Leverkuhn
)
who
suffers
from
it
.

That
this
abandonment
takes
place
on
a
stage
,
during
an
'
artistic
'
performance
,
is
enough
to
associate
Jacoby
with
art
,
and
to
bring
down
upon
him
the
punishment
for
art
;
;

There
is
no
more
plot
than
that
;
;

And
the
action
is
consistently
presented
with
regard
for
this
distinction
.

But
that
is
too
simple
,
and
won't
hold
up
.

As
the
first
sentence
suggests
,
both
roads
belong
to
death
in
the
end
.

But
the
highroad
,
according
to
the
description
of
its
traffic
,
belongs
to
life
as
it
is
lived
in
unawareness
of
death
,
while
the
way
to
the
churchyard
belongs
to
some
other
sort
of
life
:
a
suffering
form
,
an
existence
wholly
comprised
in
the
awareness
of
death
.

Piepsam
tries
to
stop
him
by
force
,
receives
a
push
in
the
chest
from
Life
,
and
is
left
standing
in
impotent
and
growing
rage
,
while
a
crowd
begins
to
gather
.

His
rage
assumes
a
religious
form
;
;

This
is
simple
enough
,
but
several
more
points
of
interest
may
be
mentioned
as
relevant
.

Piepsam's
fatal
rage
arises
not
only
because
he
cannot
stop
the
cyclist
,
but
also
because
God
will
not
stop
him
;
;

Piepsam
calls
the
cyclist
cur
and
puppy
among
other
things
,
and
at
the
crisis
of
his
fit
a
little
fox-terrier
stands
before
him
and
howls
into
his
face
.

His
unsuccessful
strivings
to
give
up
drink
are
represented
as
religious
strivings
;
;

These
polar
concerns
(
imitation
vs.
formalism
)
reflect
a
philosophical
and
religious
situation
which
has
been
developing
over
a
long
period
of
time
.

Thus
the
image
of
man
has
suffered
complete
fragmentation
in
personal
and
spiritual
qualities
,
and
complete
objectification
in
sub-human
and
quasi-mechanistic
powers
.

A
broader
concept
of
imitation
is
needed
,
one
which
acknowledges
that
true
invention
is
important
,
that
the
artist's
creativity
in
part
transcends
the
non-artistic
causal
factors
out
of
which
it
arises
.

Aristotle
also
tended
to
stratify
all
aspects
of
human
nature
and
activity
into
levels
of
excellence
and
,
like
Plato
,
he
put
the
pure
and
unimpassioned
intellect
on
the
top
level
.

In
the
first
instance
,
mimesis
is
here
used
to
mean
the
recalling
of
experience
in
terms
of
vivid
images
rather
than
in
terms
of
abstract
ideas
or
conventional
designations
.

They
bring
an
inextricable
component
of
value
within
themselves
,
with
attractions
and
repulsions
native
to
their
own
quality
.

A
word
taken
in
its
dictionary
meaning
,
a
photographic
image
of
a
recognizable
object
,
the
mere
picturing
of
a
scene
tends
to
lose
experiential
vividness
and
to
connote
such
conventional
abstractions
as
to
invite
neutral
reception
without
the
incitement
of
value
feelings
.

The
most
primitive
feelings
are
rudimentary
value
feelings
,
both
positive
and
negative
:
a
desire
to
appropriate
this
or
that
part
of
the
environment
into
oneself
;
;

a
desire
to
avoid
and
repel
this
or
that
other
part
.

After
only
eighteen
years
of
non-interference
,
there
were
already
indications
of
melioration
,
though
in
a
slight
degree
,
to
be
sure
.

For
over
a
hundred
years
Southerners
have
felt
that
the
North
was
picking
on
them
.

The
line
is
a
pretty
good
one
.

But
people
can't
be
made
to
integrate
,
socialize
(
the
two
are
inseparable
by
Southern
standards
)
by
law
.

I
was
having
lunch
not
long
ago
(
apologies
to
N.
V.
Peale
)
with
three
distinguished
historians
(
one
specializing
in
the
European
Middle
Ages
,
one
in
American
history
,
and
one
in
the
Far
East
)
,
and
I
asked
them
if
they
could
name
instances
where
the
general
mores
had
been
radically
changed
with
deliberate
speed
,
majestic
instancy
(
Francis
Thompson's
words
for
the
Hound
Of
Heaven's
Pursuit
)
by
judicial
fiat
.

Prohibition
was
the
law
of
the
land
,
but
it
was
unpopular
(
how
many
of
us
oldsters
took
up
drinking
in
prohibition
days
,
drinking
was
so
gay
,
so
fashionable
,
especially
in
the
sophisticated
Northeast
!
!

The
cliche
loses
its
talismanic
virtue
in
the
light
of
a
little
history
.

Calhoun
dealt
with
this
question
in
his
Disquisition
On
Government
.

New
England
academies
welcome
fugitives
from
the
provinces
,
South
as
well
as
West
.

They
may
even
enroll
a
colored
student
or
two
for
show
,
though
he
usually
turns
out
to
be
from
Thailand
,
or
any
place
other
than
the
American
South
.

I
leave
out
of
account
the
question
of
the
best
interests
of
the
children
,
the
question
of
what
their
best
interests
really
are
.

If
these
people
were
denied
a
voice
(
do
they
have
a
moral
right
to
a
voice
?
?

There
is
a
legend
(
Hawthorne
records
it
in
his
English
Notebooks
.

And
one
finds
it
again
in
Thomas
Nelson
Page
)
to
the
effect
that
the
Mayflower
on
its
second
voyage
brought
a
cargo
of
Negro
slaves
.

Robert
Penn
Warren
puts
it
this
way
in
Brother
To
Dragons
:
The
recognition
of
complicity
is
the
beginning
of
innocence
,
where
innocence
,
I
think
,
means
about
the
same
thing
as
redemption
.

The
slave
is
owner
,
And
ever
was
.

Pay
him
!
!

It
is
the
abstractionism
,
the
unrealism
,
of
the
pure
idealist
.

It
ignores
the
sordid
financial
aspects
(
quite
conveniently
,
too
,
for
his
audience
,
who
could
indulge
in
moral
indignation
without
visible
,
or
even
conscious
,
discomfort
,
their
money
from
the
transaction
having
been
put
away
long
ago
in
a
good
antiseptic
brokerage
)
.

Like
Pilate
,
they
had
washed
their
hands
.

New
Englanders
were
a
bit
sensitive
on
the
subject
of
their
complicity
in
Negro
slavery
at
the
time
of
the
drafting
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence
,
as
Jefferson
explained
in
his
Autobiography
:

for
though
their
people
had
very
few
slaves
themselves
,
yet
they
had
been
pretty
considerable
carriers
of
them
to
others
.

There
one
finds
concentrated
in
a
comparatively
small
area
the
chief
universities
,
colleges
,
and
preparatory
schools
of
the
United
States
.

It
is
true
that
New
England
,
more
than
any
other
section
,
was
dedicated
to
education
from
the
start
.

Isn't
it
a
bit
odd
that
the
three
states
of
Southern
New
England
(
Massachusetts
,
Connecticut
,
and
Rhode
Island
)
have
had
state
institutions
of
university
status
only
in
the
very
recent
past
,
these
institutions
having
previously
been
A
&
M
colleges
?
?

Is
it
not
ironical
that
Roger
Williams's
state
,
Rhode
Island
,
should
have
been
the
very
last
of
the
forty-eight
to
establish
a
state
university
?
?

And
what
a
galaxy
of
those
adorns
that
fair
land
!
!

In
the
early
days
of
a
homogeneous
population
,
the
public
school
was
quite
satisfactory
.

Of
these
there
are
surely
few
that
would
be
more
rewarding
discoveries
than
Verner
Von
Heidenstam
,
the
Swedish
poet
and
novelist
who
received
the
award
in
1916
and
whose
centennial
was
celebrated
two
years
ago
.

Being
somewhat
delicate
in
health
,
at
the
age
of
sixteen
he
was
sent
to
Southern
Europe
,
for
which
he
at
once
developed
a
passion
,
so
that
he
spent
nearly
all
of
the
following
ten
years
abroad
,
at
first
in
Italy
,
then
in
Greece
,
Egypt
,
Asia
Minor
,
and
Palestine
.

In
this
final
line
,
we
have
the
key
to
his
nature
.

Few
writers
have
better
understood
their
deepest
selves
.

It
was
a
brilliant
debut
,
so
much
so
indeed
that
it
aroused
a
new
vitality
in
the
younger
poets
,
as
did
Byron's
Childe
Harold
.

Professor
Fredrik
Book
,
Sweden's
foremost
critic
of
the
period
,
acclaims
it
as
follows
:
In
this
we
have
the
verse
of
a
painter
;
;

all
is
seen
and
felt
and
experienced
,
the
observation
is
sharp
and
the
imagination
lively
.

It
celebrates
the
unknown
architect
who
designed
the
temple
of
Neptune
at
Paestum
,
next
to
the
Parthenon
the
noblest
example
of
Grecian
classic
style
now
in
existence
.

Not
so
,
he
answers
,
it
is
not
the
architect
but
the
temple
that
is
immortal
.

The
hero
,
who
is
himself
,
is
represented
as
a
pilgrim
in
the
storied
lands
of
the
East
,
a
sort
of
Faustus
type
,
who
,
to
quote
from
Professor
Book
again
,
even
in
the
pleasure
gardens
of
Sardanapalus
can
not
cease
from
his
painful
search
after
the
meaning
of
life
.

By
the
death
of
his
father
in
1888
he
had
come
into
possession
of
the
family
estate
and
had
re-assumed
its
traditions
.

Like
his
friend
and
contemporary
August
Strindberg
he
had
little
patience
with
collective
mediocrity
.

Though
it
centers
around
the
brilliant
and
enigmatic
figure
of
Charles
12
,
,
the
true
hero
is
not
finally
the
king
himself
.

Hence
the
title
of
the
book
,
referring
to
the
soldiers
and
subjects
of
the
king
;
;

They
comprise
a
great
variety
of
scene
and
interest
:
grim
episodes
of
war
,
idyllic
interludes
,
superb
canvases
of
world-shaking
events
,
and
delightfully
humorous
sketches
of
odd
characters
.

The
general
effect
is
tragic
.

His
peculiar
gift
,
as
had
been
suggested
before
,
is
his
intensity
.

George
Meredith
has
said
that
fervor
is
the
core
of
style
.

His
purpose
,
however
,
was
not
to
establish
an
empire
,
but
to
assert
the
principle
of
divine
justice
.

Each
failed
catastrophically
in
an
invasion
of
Russia
and
each
brought
ruin
on
the
country
that
worshipped
him
.

After
the
collapse
of
that
desperate
and
ill-fated
campaign
the
character
of
the
king
degenerated
for
a
time
into
a
futility
that
was
not
merely
pitiable
but
often
ridiculous
.

This
is
brought
out
in
the
next
to
last
chapter
of
the
book
,
A
Hero's
Funeral
,
written
in
the
form
of
an
impassioned
prose
poem
.

Especially
touching
is
the
chapter
,
The
Little
Sister
,
about
a
king's
daughter
who
became
a
nun
in
the
convent
of
St.
Birgitta
.

Gustaf
Vasa
is
a
superb
example
,
and
Charles
10
,
,
the
conqueror
of
Denmark
,
hardly
less
so
.

no
client
would
ever
think
of
asking
him
to
do
such
things
.

He
is
an
individualist
but
not
an
anarchist
;
;

he
is
a
public
servant
but
not
a
cop
.

but
his
morality
rests
upon
that
of
his
society
.

if
he
is
legal
,
he
may
not
be
good
.

Sherlock
Holmes
is
not
merely
an
individualist
;
;

he
is
a
recluse
,
an
incredible
egotist
,
a
confirmed
misogynist
.

His
eccentricity
begins
as
a
defense
against
boredom
.

The
two
men
resemble
each
other
closely
in
their
cunning
,
their
egotism
,
their
relentlessness
.

it
is
true
that
they
are
also
extremely
dull
.

In
the
American
hardboiled
detective
story
of
the
'20s
and
'30s
,
the
spirit
of
the
mad
genius
from
Baker
Street
lives
on
.

Like
Holmes
,
the
American
private
eye
rejects
the
social
conventions
of
his
time
.

he
is
not
an
eccentric
but
rather
an
outcast
.

Wolfe
refuses
to
ever
leave
his
own
house
,
and
spends
most
of
his
time
drinking
beer
and
playing
with
orchids
.

A
similar
tone
of
underlying
futility
and
despair
pervades
the
spy
thrillers
of
Eric
Ambler
and
dominates
the
most
famous
of
all
American
mystery
stories
,
Dashiell
Hammett's
The
Maltese
Falcon
.

Now
the
detective
must
save
his
own
skin
by
informing
on
the
girl
he
loves
,
who
is
also
the
real
murderer
.

In
either
case
,
they
do
not
appreciate
the
private
detective's
zeal
.

Perry
Mason
and
Hamilton
Burger
,
Nero
Wolfe
and
Inspector
Cramer
spend
more
time
fighting
each
other
than
they
do
in
looking
for
the
criminal
.

But
even
when
the
police
are
honest
,
they
do
not
trust
the
private
eye
.

He
is
,
like
Phillip
Marlowe
,
too
alienated
to
be
reliable
.

In
order
to
save
the
mystery
story
,
they
have
converted
the
private
detective
into
an
organization
man
.

It
will
be
shown
that
the
objectives
of
the
cooperative
people
in
an
organization
determine
the
type
of
network
required
,
because
the
type
of
network
functions
according
to
the
characteristics
of
the
messages
enumerated
in
Table
1
.

Great
stress
is
placed
on
the
role
that
the
monitoring
of
information
sending
plays
in
maintaining
the
effectiveness
of
the
network
.

Networks
illustrating
some
special
types
of
organization

We
assume
for
this
illustration
that
the
size
of
the
land
plots
is
so
great
that
the
distance
between
dwellings
is
greater
than
the
voice
can
carry
and
that
most
of
the
communication
is
between
nearest
neighbors
only
,
as
shown
in
Figure
2
.

Years
ago
this
was
true
,
but
with
the
replacement
of
wires
or
runners
by
radio
and
radar
(
and
perhaps
television
)
,
these
restrictions
have
disappeared
and
now
again
too
much
is
heard
.

It
will
readily
be
seen
that
in
this
suggested
network
(
not
materially
different
from
some
of
the
networks
in
vogue
today
)
greater
emphasis
on
monitoring
is
implied
than
is
usually
put
into
practice
.

Such
problems
are
of
extreme
interest
as
well
as
importance
and
are
so
much
like
fighting
in
a
rain
forest
or
guerrilla
warfare
at
night
in
tall
grass
that
we
might
have
to
re-examine
primitive
conflicts
for
what
they
could
teach
.

Since
the
difficulty
of
drawing
the
net
is
great
,
we
will
merely
discuss
it
.

For
example
,
there
are
persons
who
are
in
physical
science
,
in
the
field
of
mineralogy
,
trained
in
crystallography
,
who
use
only
X-rays
,
applying
only
the
powder
technique
of
X-ray
diffraction
,
to
clay
minerals
only
,
and
who
have
spent
the
last
fifteen
years
concentrating
on
the
montmorillonites
;
;

or
persons
in
the
social
sciences
in
the
field
of
anthropology
,
studying
the
lung
capacity
of
seven
Andean
Indians
.

Let
me
quote
him
even
more
fully
,
for
his
analysis
is
important
to
my
theme
.

He
says
:
beside
the
Protestant
philosophy
of
Progress
,
as
expressed
in
radical
or
conservative
millenarianism
,
should
be
placed
the
doctrine
of
the
democratic
faith
which
affirmed
it
to
be
the
duty
of
the
destiny
of
the
United
States
to
assist
in
the
creation
of
a
better
world
by
keeping
lighted
the
beacon
of
democracy
.

It
seemed
to
me
that
the
liberals
had
scrapped
the
balanced
polarity
and
reposed
both
liberty
and
the
fundamental
law
in
the
common
man
.

What
had
happened
to
the
common
man
?
?

The
riotous
onrush
of
industrialism
after
the
War
for
Southern
Independence
and
the
general
secular
drift
to
the
Religion
of
Humanity
,
however
,
prepared
the
way
for
a
reception
of
the
French
Revolution's
socialistic
offspring
of
one
sort
of
another
.

Moreover
the
centralization
of
our
economy
during
the
1920s
,
the
dislocations
of
the
Depression
,
the
common
ethos
of
Materialism
everywhere
,
all
contributed
in
various
ways
to
the
face-lifting
that
replaced
Mike
Fink
and
the
Great
Gatsby
with
the
anonymous
physiognomy
of
the
Little
People
.

Then
suddenly
we
found
ourselves
in
the
middle
of
another
fight
,
an
irrational
,
an
indecent
,
an
undeclared
and
immoral
war
with
our
strongest
(
and
some
had
thought
noblest
)
ally
.

All
of
this
,
I
know
,
is
recent
history
familiar
to
you
.

But
before
I
try
to
diagnose
it
,
I
would
offer
other
evidence
.

What
I
want
to
point
out
here
is
that
all
of
them
are
ex-liberals
,
or
modified
liberals
,
with
perhaps
one
exception
.

Only
Walter
Lippman
envisioned
the
possibility
of
our
having
outlived
most
of
what
we
used
to
regard
as
the
program
of
our
national
purposes
.

What
is
the
common
man's
complaint
?
?

Has
not
that
way
been
lit
always
by
the
lamp
of
liberalism
up
until
the
turning
back
under
Eisenhower
?
?

And
the
basic
character
of
that
liberalism
has
been
spiritual
rather
than
economic
.

Does
our
society
have
a
runaway
,
uncontrollable
growth
of
technology
which
may
end
our
civilization
,
or
a
normal
,
healthy
growth
?
?

So
an
objective
look
at
our
present
procedures
may
move
us
to
consider
seriously
this
possibly
analogous
situation
.

Hence
the
prime
issue
,
as
I
see
it
,
is
whether
a
democratic
or
free
society
can
master
technology
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
,
or
whether
technology
will
rule
and
develop
its
own
society
compatible
with
its
own
needs
as
a
force
of
nature
.

Properly
mindful
of
all
the
cultures
in
existence
today
throughout
the
world
,
we
must
employ
these
resources
without
war
or
violent
revolution
.

If
we
were
creating
a
wholly
new
society
,
we
could
insist
that
our
social
,
political
,
economic
and
philosophic
institutions
foster
rather
than
hamper
man
;
;

Asked
which
institution
most
needs
correction
,
I
would
say
the
corporation
as
it
exists
in
America
today
.

They
were
not
diplomats
or
jazz
musicians
,
or
even
organizers
of
reading-rooms
and
photo-montage
displays
,
but
rugged
capitalist
entrepreneurs
like
Henry
Ford
,
Hugh
Cooper
,
Thomas
Campbell
,
the
International
Harvester
Co.
,
and
David
W.
Griffith
.

Their
kind
created
an
American
culture
superior
to
any
in
the
world
,
an
industrial
and
technological
culture
which
penetrated
Russia
as
it
did
almost
every
corner
of
the
earth
without
a
nickel
from
the
Federal
treasury
or
a
single
governmental
specialist
to
contrive
directives
or
program
a
series
of
consultations
of
interested
agencies
.

No
amount
of
ballyhoo
will
cover
up
the
sordid
facts
.

First
,
let
us
realize
that
whatever
good
this
set-up
achieved
in
earlier
times
,
now
the
corporation
per
se
cannot
take
economic
leadership
.

Socialism
,
I
grant
,
has
a
definite
place
in
our
society
.

But
let
us
not
complain
of
the
evils
of
capitalism
by
referring
to
a
form
that
is
not
truly
capitalistic
.

But
the
pseudo-capitalism
which
dictates
our
whole
economy
as
well
as
our
politics
and
social
life
,
will
not
stand
close
scrutiny
.

Its
pretense
to
operate
in
the
public
interest
is
little
more
than
a
sham
.

As
a
creative
enterprise
,
its
abilities
are
primarily
in
swallowing
creative
enterprises
developed
outside
its
own
organization
(
an
ability
made
possible
by
us
,
and
almost
mandatory
)
.

Such
genuine
human
leadership
the
proprietorship
can
offer
,
corporations
cannot
.

Proprietorships
can
establish
a
meaningful
identity
,
representing
a
human
personality
,
and
thus
establish
sincere
relationships
with
customers
and
community
.

The
proprietor
is
able
to
create
a
leadership
impossible
in
the
corporate
structure
with
its
board
of
directors
and
stockholders
.

Hence
government
must
establish
greater
controls
upon
corporations
so
that
their
activities
promote
what
is
deemed
essential
to
the
national
interest
.

In
my
own
company
,
in
effect
a
partnership
,
although
legally
a
corporation
,
I
have
been
able
to
do
many
things
for
my
employees
which
normal
corporations
of
comparable
size
and
nature
would
have
been
unable
to
do
.

Our
pin-curl
clips
and
self-locking
nuts
achieved
dominance
in
just
a
few
years
time
,
despite
substantial
,
well
established
competition
.

During
the
last
years
of
Woodrow
Wilson's
administration
,
a
red
scare
developed
in
our
country
.

Attorney
General
Palmer
made
a
series
of
raids
that
sent
more
than
4,000
so-called
radicals
to
the
jails
,
in
direct
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights
.

Then
,
not
many
years
later
,
the
Un-American
Activities
Committee
,
under
the
leadership
of
Martin
Dies
,
pilloried
hundreds
of
decent
,
patriotic
citizens
.

Demagogues
of
this
sort
found
communist
bogeys
lurking
behind
any
new
idea
that
would
run
counter
to
stereotyped
notions
.

He
appealed
to
us
to
bring
his
case
to
the
attention
of
the
authorities
that
justice
might
be
done
.

But
was
he
infallible
in
all
things
?
?

He
took
the
story
of
the
pound
of
flesh
and
had
to
fasten
it
on
someone
.

No
Jew
was
on
hand
to
boycott
his
financially
struggling
theater
.

but
a
Jewish
heart
.

If
living
Jews
were
unavailable
for
study
,
the
Bible
was
at
hand
.

Does
this
help
the
non-Jew
to
understand
this
group
?
?

Thomas
De
Torquemada
,
Inquisitor-General
of
the
Spanish
Inquisition
,
put
many
persons
to
death
.

he
is
out
of
place
in
our
times
.

A
successful
businessman
recently
prefaced
his
address
to
a
luncheon
group
with
the
statement
that
all
economists
should
be
sent
to
the
hospitals
for
the
mentally
deranged
where
they
and
their
theories
might
rot
together
.

What
of
the
efficiency
of
this
natural
instrument
of
free
discussion
?
?

The
Leopard's
Spots
came
from
the
pen
of
Thomas
Dixon
in
1902
,
and
in
this
he
announced
an
unchangeable
law
.

Will
argument
and
debate
decide
its
truth
or
falsity
?
?

For
answers
to
such
questions
we
must
turn
to
the
anthropologists
,
the
biologists
,
the
historians
,
the
psychologists
,
and
the
sociologists
.

For
several
generations
much
fiction
has
appeared
dealing
with
the
steprelationship
.

The
stepmother
,
almost
without
exception
,
has
been
presented
as
a
cruel
ogress
.

Research
into
several
cultures
has
proven
her
position
to
be
a
mistaken
one
.

But
ideas
,
just
for
the
sake
of
having
them
,
are
not
enough
.

But
is
the
result
new
barnsful
of
tested
knowledge
on
the
basis
of
which
we
can
with
confidence
solve
our
domestic
and
international
problems
?
?

it
did
not
even
provide
the
architect's
plan
for
anything
new
.

By
no
means
would
we
discourage
the
production
of
ideas
:
they
provide
raw
materials
with
which
to
work
;
;

It
was
a
response
to
the
conflict
between
political
pressure
and
the
moral
intuition
which
resulted
in
attempts
at
prediction
.

In
no
other
situation
would
a
group
of
doctors
,
struggling
competently
to
improve
the
life
expectancy
of
a
man
beloved
by
the
world
,
be
subjected
to
such
merciless
and
persistent
questioning
,
and
before
they
were
prepared
to
demonstrate
the
kind
of
verbal
precision
which
alone
can
clarify
for
mankind
the
problems
it
faces
.

Yet
the
attitude
that
the
fate
of
the
Presidency
demands
in
such
a
situation
is
quite
distinct
from
the
simple
courage
that
can
proceed
with
battles
to
be
fought
,
regardless
of
the
consequences
.

In
this
case
others
should
not
have
had
to
raise
the
doubts
and
fears
.

The
Presidency
demands
an
incisive
awareness
of
the
larger
implications
of
the
death
of
any
incumbent
.

At
the
national
and
international
level
,
then
,
what
is
the
highest
kind
of
morality
for
the
private
citizen
represents
an
instance
of
political
immorality
.

And
we
had
the
uneasy
sense
that
the
cleavage
between
the
moral
and
the
political
progressed
amid
the
events
which
concern
us
.

The
double
editorial
on
Two
Aspects
Of
The
U.S.
Spirit
was
subtly
calculated
to
suggest
a
moral
sanction
for
gambles
great
as
well
as
small
,
reflecting
popular
approval
of
this
questionable
attitude
toward
the
highest
office
in
the
land
.

My
doctors
assure
me
that
this
increased
percentage
of
risk
is
not
great
.

Only
infrequently
did
the
situation
color
his
thinking
.

and
we
watch
him
amid
the
overtones
which
suggest
he
could
never
in
any
conscience
urge
a
risk
upon
the
voters
.

Moving
as
he
is
into
the
phase
of
the
campaign
which
demands
conviction
of
him
,
he
adopts
a
position
that
is
morally
indefensible
.

But
it
is
also
the
climax
to
one
of
the
absorbing
chapters
in
our
current
political
history
.

Drifting
through
a
third
illness
,
apparently
without
any
provision
for
the
handling
of
a
major
national
emergency
other
than
a
talk
with
the
vice-president
,
Eisenhower
revealed
the
singularly
static
quality
of
his
thinking
.

Despite
three
warnings
,
no
sense
of
moral
urgency
impelled
him
to
distinguish
his
situation
,
and
thus
his
responsibilities
,
from
Wilson's
.

Like
Lincoln
,
he
can
distinguish
his
relation
to
God
from
the
constitutional
responsibilities
a
questionable
decision
exacts
of
him
.

Like
Roosevelt
,
he
can
distinguish
an
attitude
toward
a
Russian
leader
he
may
share
with
a
host
of
Americans
from
the
responsibilities
diplomatic
convention
may
impose
upon
him
.

He
chooses
to
subordinate
one
to
the
other
,
sometimes
reluctantly
,
accepting
criticism
for
the
lesser
immoralities
facts
breed
.

The
very
nature
of
a
choice
so
grounded
in
distinction
and
fact
leads
to
the
valid
convictions
which
become
force
of
will
in
the
manifest
leader
.

The
making
of
distinctions
,
like
the
perception
of
the
great
distinctions
made
,
is
an
inordinately
difficult
business
.

In
his
recent
evaluation
of
Kennedy's
potentialities
for
leadership
,
Walter
Lippmann
has
cited
the
precision
of
his
mind
,
his
immense
command
of
factual
detail
,
and
his
instinct
for
the
crucial
point
as
impressive
in
the
extreme
;
;

The
liberal-conservative
division
,
we
might
observe
in
passing
,
is
not
of
itself
directly
involved
in
a
private
interest
conflict
nor
even
in
struggle
between
ruling
groups
.

These
ways
are
absolutely
irreconcilable
because
they
offer
two
different
recipes
for
man's
redemption
from
chaos
.

If
we
examine
the
three
types
of
change
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
internal
structure
we
find
an
additional
profound
difference
between
the
third
and
the
first
two
,
one
that
accounts
for
the
notable
difference
between
the
responses
they
evoke
.

Voegelin
has
analyzed
this
experience
in
the
case
of
the
stable
,
healthy
community
.

It
has
lost
its
ground
of
being
and
floats
in
a
mist
of
appearances
.

Relativism
and
equality
are
its
characteristic
diseases
.

At
that
point
we
reach
the
closed
historical
situation
:
the
situation
in
which
man
is
no
longer
free
to
return
to
a
status
quo
ante
.

The
ontological
status
of
society
thus
is
constituted
by
the
psychological
status
of
society's
members
.

Those
social
,
civilizational
factors
not
rooted
in
the
human
spirit
of
the
group
,
ultimately
cease
to
exist
.

Civilization
itself
--
tradition
--
falls
out
of
existence
when
the
human
spirit
itself
becomes
confused
.

It
is
not
enough
for
man
to
be
an
ontological
esse
.

This
happens
at
the
moment
man
loses
the
perception
of
moral
substance
in
himself
,
of
a
nature
that
,
in
Maritain's
words
,
is
perceived
as
a
locus
of
intelligible
necessities
.

Thus
with
regard
to
the
loss
of
tradition
,
in
the
change
from
order
to
disorder
the
metaphysics
of
change
works
itself
out
as
a
disruption
of
the
individual
soul
,
a
change
in
which
man
continues
as
an
objective
ontological
existent
,
but
no
longer
as
a
man
.

Now
in
the
mere
fact
of
the
beginning
of
such
displacement
we
have
prima-facie
evidence
of
the
ontological
weakness
of
the
fading
form
.

Both
are
predictably
destined
to
fail
.

Its
essence
lies
in
its
attempt
to
recover
previous
order
through
the
repression
of
disruptive
forces
.

Seemingly
,
order
is
perceived
as
a
kind
of
subsistent
entity
now
covered
by
adventitious
accretions
.

Such
a
response
,
of
course
,
misses
the
point
that
in
crisis
order
is
going
out
of
existence
.

Since
a
civilizational
crisis
involves
also
a
crisis
in
private
interests
and
in
the
ruling
class
,
reaction
is
normally
found
among
those
who
feel
themselves
to
be
among
the
ruling
class
.

Their
great
error
is
to
mingle
the
responses
typical
of
each
of
the
three
types
of
change
.

Since
civilizational
change
is
the
most
difficult
to
perceive
and
analyze
,
it
seldom
is
given
adequate
attention
.

The
basic
truth
in
the
reactionary
response
is
to
be
found
in
its
realistic
assumption
of
the
primacy
of
the
real
over
the
ideational
.

In
both
cases
the
individual
tends
to
be
treated
as
an
instrument
of
the
organic
reality
.

I
am
not
making
a
clinical
judgment
here
,
for
such
personal
tragedies
are
real
and
are
commonplace
in
the
analyst's
consulting
room
,
but
literature
makes
a
different
claim
upon
our
sympathies
than
tragedy
in
life
.

A
man
in
a
novel
who
is
defeated
in
his
childhood
and
condemned
by
unconscious
forces
within
him
to
tiredly
repeat
his
earliest
failure
in
love
,
only
makes
us
a
little
weary
of
man
;
;

Now
we
can
argue
that
the
irresistible
fate
of
Oedipus
Rex
was
nothing
more
than
the
irresistible
unconscious
longings
of
Oedipus
projected
outward
,
but
this
externalization
of
unconscious
conflict
makes
all
the
difference
between
a
story
and
a
clinical
case
history
.

Whatever
the
psychological
truth
in
the
Oedipus
myth
,
an
Oedipus
who
is
drawn
to
his
fate
by
irresistible
external
forces
can
carry
the
symbol
of
humanity
and
its
archaic
crime
,
and
the
incest
that
is
unknowing
renews
the
mystery
of
the
eternal
dream
of
childhood
and
absorbs
us
in
the
secret
.

But
a
modern
Oedipus
who
is
doomed
because
he
cannot
oppose
his
own
childhood
is
only
pathetic
,
and
for
renouncing
the
mystery
in
favor
of
psychological
truth
he
gives
up
the
claim
on
our
sympathies
.

Incest
is
still
a
durable
theme
,
but
if
it
wants
to
get
written
about
it
will
have
to
find
ways
to
surprise
the
emotions
,
and
there
is
no
better
way
to
do
this
than
that
of
concealment
and
symbolic
representation
.

And
the
best
way
to
conceal
and
disguise
the
elements
of
an
incest
story
is
not
to
set
out
to
write
an
incest
story
.

I
am
only
singling
out
differences
in
treatment
of
a
theme
and
the
resultant
effects
.

There
are
ghostly
scenes
in
which
the
little
boy
on
his
rocking
horse
rocks
madly
toward
the
climax
that
will
magically
give
him
the
name
of
the
winning
horse
.

The
child
grows
rich
on
his
winnings
and
conspires
with
his
uncle
to
make
secret
gifts
of
his
money
to
his
mother
.

The
story
ends
in
the
child's
illness
and
delirium
brought
on
by
the
feverish
compulsion
to
ride
his
horse
to
win
for
his
mother
.

But
on
one
occasion
when
I
encountered
a
similar
fantasy
in
a
little
boy
who
was
my
patient
I
began
to
understand
the
uncanny
effects
of
this
story
.

The
rocking
has
the
ambiguous
function
of
keeping
the
erotic
undercurrent
silent
and
making
it
present
;
;

And
if
we
understand
the
rocking
as
an
erotic
symbol
we
can
also
see
how
well
it
serves
as
the
symbol
of
impending
tragedy
.

We
are
also
struck
by
the
fact
that
this
story
of
a
boy's
love
for
his
mother
does
not
offend
,
while
the
incestuous
love
of
the
man
,
Paul
Morel
,
sometimes
repels
.

And
when
the
child
dies
in
Lawrence's
story
in
a
delirium
that
is
somehow
brought
on
by
his
mania
to
win
and
to
make
his
mother
rich
,
the
manifest
absurdity
of
such
a
disease
and
such
a
death
does
not
enter
into
our
thoughts
at
all
.

I
am
sure
that
none
of
the
effects
of
this
story
were
consciously
employed
by
Lawrence
to
describe
an
oedipal
fantasy
in
childhood
.

It
is
most
probable
that
Freud
and
the
Oedipus
complex
never
entered
his
head
in
the
writing
of
this
story
.

In
our
own
time
we
have
seen
that
the
novelist's
debt
to
psychoanalysis
has
increased
but
that
the
novel
itself
has
not
profited
much
from
this
marriage
.

Ortega's
hope
that
modern
psychology
might
yet
bring
forth
a
last
flowering
of
the
novel
has
only
been
partially
fulfilled
.

I
have
argued
that
Oedipus
of
the
Oedipus
complex
has
a
doubtful
future
as
a
tragic
figure
in
literature
.

There
is
probably
some
significance
in
the
fact
that
two
of
the
best
incest
stories
I
have
encountered
in
recent
years
are
burlesques
of
the
incest
myth
.

In
both
the
farmer's
tale
in
Ralph
Ellison's
Invisible
Man
and
in
Thomas
Mann's
The
Holy
Sinner
,
the
incest
hero
rises
above
the
myth
by
accepting
the
wish
as
motive
;
;

Grigorss
goes
off
to
do
penance
on
a
rock
for
seventeen
years
.

At
the
end
of
this
period
two
pious
Christians
in
Rome
receive
the
revelation
which
leads
them
to
seek
the
next
Pope
on
the
rock
.

Grigorss
comes
to
Rome
and
becomes
a
great
and
beloved
Pope
.

In
the
last
pages
of
the
book
Sibylla
comes
to
Rome
to
seek
an
audience
with
the
great
Pope
and
to
give
her
confession
.

but
,
he
held
,
instead
of
continuing
as
an
art
of
reduction
,
it
must
grow
,
must
make
a
place
for
the
contributions
of
the
Raphaels
and
Poussins
as
well
as
for
those
of
the
early
cubists
and
Mondrian
.

But
his
own
work
was
evolving
further
.

The
extreme
limitations
he
sensed
in
all
current
abstract
art
made
that
seem
to
him
increasingly
arid
and
cold
.

But
he
was
afraid
of
the
future
--
he
would
in
fact
welcome
a
way
back
to
social
integration
,
a
functional
art
of
some
kind
.

But
whereas
the
postwar
American
abstractionists
seem
to
Helion
to
be
determined
to
escape
from
the
real
world
,
or
simply
to
rebel
against
it
,
the
ordered
abstractions
which
he
and
his
associates
of
the
1930's
were
painting
embodied
the
hope
of
improving
things
.

Very
much
the
political
man
,
Helion
felt
himself
deeply
affected
by
the
increasingly
pessimistic
atmosphere
of
France
and
all
Europe
,
whose
foundations
seemed
to
him
more
and
more
shaky
.

The
Rooseveltian
America
was
a
haven
of
liberalism
and
progress
and
seemed
to
him
to
constitute
the
last
best
hope
for
civilization
.

After
a
year
in
a
studio
on
Sheridan
Square
,
having
married
an
American
girl
who
was
a
native
of
Virginia
,
Helion
moved
to
a
village
in
the
Blue
Ridge
mountains
,
where
he
produced
some
of
the
most
imposing
of
his
abstract
canvases
.

It
was
then
I
knew
that
they
were
making
war
against
Man
,
the
individual
within
!
!

--
who
questioned
things
when
given
orders
.

How
much
they
esteemed
him
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
their
underground
committee
selected
him
as
one
of
the
few
who
would
be
helped
to
escape
.

In
the
prison
camp's
Black
Market
civilian
clothes
were
quietly
bought
and
forged
papers
were
devised
for
him
;
;

Four
hands
were
stretched
toward
me
by
my
comrades
behind
me
.

Riding
trains
,
hitching
hikes
on
trucks
across
Germany
,
slipping
through
guarded
frontiers
with
the
help
of
secret
guides
,
he
eventually
reached
Vichy
France
,
and
,
by
the
winter
of
1943
,
was
back
in
Virginia
.

They
too
loved
their
families
,
longed
for
their
villages
:
yet
lacked
the
faith
that
drove
one
to
dare
the
fearful
chance
of
escape
.

It
was
a
time
of
revelations
for
him
.

In
prison
he
had
been
able
to
sketch
nothing
but
figures
from
life
,
his
guards
,
his
companions
in
misery
.

Others
writing
on
Faulkner
have
found
the
phrase
traditional
moralist
either
inadequate
or
misleading
.

It
is
to
say
rather
,
I
believe
,
that
he
has
brought
to
bear
on
the
history
,
the
traditions
,
and
the
lore
of
his
region
a
critical
,
skeptical
mind
--
the
same
mind
which
has
made
of
him
an
inveterate
experimenter
in
literary
form
and
technique
.

His
earliest
work
reflected
heavy
influences
from
English
and
continental
writers
.

The
planter
aristocracy
has
appeared
in
literature
at
least
since
John
Pendleton
Kennedy
published
Swallow-Barn
in
1832
and
in
his
genial
portrait
of
Frank
Meriwether
presiding
over
his
plantation
dominion
initiated
the
most
persistent
tradition
of
Southern
literature
.

The
myth
of
the
Southern
plantation
has
had
only
a
tangential
relation
with
actuality
,
as
Francis
Pendleton
Gaines
showed
forty
years
ago
,
and
I
suspect
it
has
had
a
far
narrower
acceptance
as
something
real
than
has
generally
been
supposed
.

Faulkner's
low-class
characters
had
but
few
counterparts
in
earlier
Southern
novels
dealing
with
plantation
life
.

They
have
an
ancestry
extending
back
,
however
,
at
least
to
1728
,
when
William
Byrd
described
the
Lubberlanders
he
encountered
in
the
back
country
of
Virginia
and
North
Carolina
.

Johnson
Jones
Hooper
,
whose
character
Simon
Suggs
bears
a
close
kinship
to
Flem
Snopes
in
both
his
willingness
to
take
cruel
advantage
of
all
and
sundry
and
the
sharpness
with
which
he
habitually
carried
out
his
will
;
;

Such
a
comparison
reminds
us
that
in
employing
low
characters
in
his
works
Faulkner
is
recording
actuality
in
the
South
and
moreover
is
following
a
long-established
literary
precedent
.

but
the
basic
puzzles
of
existence
would
still
be
puzzling
,
and
we
should
still
have
to
work
out
the
sort
of
problems
we
plan
to
discuss
in
this
article
.

He
is
a
parent
with
a
child
to
nurture
,
here
and
now
,
and
he
is
an
educator
who
worries
about
the
children
half
way
round
the
world
.

He
is
a
utopian
with
a
stake
in
tomorrow
and
he
is
a
vulnerable
human
made
captive
by
the
circumstances
of
today
.

There
is
another
kind
of
ardor
,
a
quiet
,
sure
devotion
to
the
fundamental
decencies
of
human
life
,
but
no
angry
utopian
contentions
.

You
could
also
say
that
in
these
pamphlets
is
a
relieving
quality
of
maturity
.

This
is
the
good
kind
of
sophistication
,
and
with
all
our
problems
and
crises
this
kind
of
sophistication
has
flowered
in
the
United
States
during
recent
years
.

At
one
time
it
seemed
as
if
the
Soviet
Union
had
done
us
a
favor
by
providing
a
striking
example
of
how
not
to
behave
towards
other
peoples
and
other
nations
.

Shocked
at
the
response
to
our
proclamations
,
we
grow
more
defensive
,
and
worse
,
we
lose
our
sense
of
humor
and
proportion
.

Mr.
Nehru
is
subjected
to
stern
lectures
on
neutralism
by
our
Department
of
State
,
and
an
American
President
observes
sourly
that
Sweden
would
be
a
little
less
neurotic
if
it
were
a
little
more
capitalistic
.

The
interesting
thing
about
Mr.
Lyford's
approach
,
and
the
approach
of
the
contributors
to
The
Agreeable
Autocracies
(
Oceana
Publications
,
1961
)
to
the
situation
of
American
civilization
,
is
that
it
is
concerned
with
comprehending
the
psychological
relationships
which
are
having
a
decisive
effect
on
American
life
.

In
an
ideological
argument
,
the
participants
tend
to
thump
the
table
.

Should
Rousseau
have
been
able
to
leave
room
in
his
social
theory
for
the
advent
of
television
,
atomic
energy
,
and
IBM
machines
?
?

The
obvious
natural
fact
to
ancient
thinkers
was
the
diurnal
rotation
of
the
heavens
.

Nor
did
a
constellation's
stars
vary
in
brightness
during
the
course
of
their
nocturnal
flights
.

this
was
clear
from
the
contour
of
the
shadow
traced
by
a
gnomon
before
and
after
noon
.

Ships
disappear
hull-first
over
the
horizon
;
;

approaching
shore
their
masts
appeared
first
.

In
light
of
all
this
,
one
would
require
special
reasons
for
saying
that
the
paths
of
the
heavenly
bodies
were
other
than
circular
.

By
distinguishing
superlunary
(
celestial
)
and
sublunary
(
terrestrial
)
existence
,
and
reinforcing
this
with
the
four-element
physics
of
Empedocles
,
Aristotle
came
to
speak
of
the
stars
as
perfect
bodies
,
which
moved
in
only
a
perfect
way
,
viz.
in
a
perfect
circle
.

It
is
never
motion
towards
something
.

Perfect
,
complete
entities
,
if
they
move
at
all
,
do
not
move
towards
what
they
lack
.

They
move
only
in
accordance
with
what
is
in
their
natures
.

This
is
clear
when
one
distinguishes
the
types
of
motion
appropriate
to
both
regions
.

Their
motion
will
be
eternal
and
perfect
.

The
Almagest
and
The
Hypotheses
outline
Ptolemy's
conception
of
his
own
task
as
the
provision
of
computational
tables
,
independent
calculating
devices
for
the
prediction
of
future
planetary
perturbations
.

They
all
have
this
in
common
:
the
earth
is
situated
near
the
center
of
the
deferent
.

It
is
the
chief
merit
in
Copernicus'
work
that
all
his
planetary
calculations
are
interdependent
.

He
cannot
describe
eclipses
without
entertaining
some
form
of
a
three-body
problem
.

In
Ptolemaic
terms
,
however
,
eclipses
and
retrograde
motion
were
phenomena
simpliciter
,
to
be
explained
directly
as
possible
resultants
of
epicyclical
combinations
.

In
a
systematic
astronomy
,
like
that
of
Copernicus
,
retrogradations
become
part
of
the
conceptual
structure
of
the
system
;
;

Another
contrast
stressed
when
discussing
Ptolemaic
vs.
Copernican
astronomy
,
turns
on
the
idea
of
simplicity
.

It
is
often
stated
that
Copernican
astronomy
is
'
simpler
'
than
Ptolemaic
.

Some
even
say
that
this
is
the
reason
for
the
ultimate
acceptance
of
the
former
.

Copernicus
,
by
placing
the
sun
at
the
center
of
the
planetary
universe
,
was
able
to
reduce
the
number
of
epicycles
from
eighty-three
to
seventeen
.

Without
careful
qualification
this
can
be
misleading
.

If
in
any
one
calculation
Ptolemy
had
had
to
invoke
83
epicycles
all
at
once
,
while
Copernicus
never
required
more
than
one
third
this
number
,
then
(
in
the
sense
obvious
to
Margenau
)
Ptolemaic
astronomy
would
be
simpler
than
Copernican
.

This
was
not
simpler
but
much
more
difficult
than
exercises
within
Ptolemy's
astronomy
.

In
a
sense
,
Einstein's
theory
is
simpler
than
Newton's
,
and
there
is
a
corresponding
sense
in
which
Copernicus'
theory
is
simpler
than
Ptolemy's
.

The
number
of
primitive
ideas
in
systematically-simple
theories
is
reduced
to
a
minimum
.

It
is
an
organized
system
of
these
things
.

1543
A.D.
is
often
venerated
as
the
birthday
of
the
scientific
revolution
.

In
what
does
the
dissatisfaction
of
Copernicus-the-astronomer
consist
?
?

What
in
The
Almagest
draws
his
fire
?
?

The
formal
displacement
of
the
geocentric
principle
far
from
being
Copernicus'
primary
concern
,
was
introduced
only
to
resolve
what
seemed
to
him
intolerable
in
orthodox
astronomy
,
namely
,
the
'
unphysical
'
triplication
of
centric
reference-points
:
one
center
from
which
the
planet's
distances
were
calculated
,
another
around
which
planetary
velocities
were
computed
,
and
still
a
third
center
(
the
earth
)
from
which
the
observations
originated
.

Copernicus
required
a
systematically
integrated
,
physically
intelligible
astronomy
.

The
latter
looked
backward
upon
inherited
deficiencies
.

Without
abandoning
too
much
,
Copernicus
sought
to
make
orthodox
astronomy
systematically
and
mechanically
acceptable
.

Henrietta
was
discovering
in
the
process
of
writing
,
as
the
born
writer
does
,
not
merely
a
channel
for
the
discharge
of
accumulated
information
but
a
stimulus
to
the
development
of
the
creative
powers
of
observation
,
insight
and
intuition
.

Another
source
of
intellectual
stimulus
was
opened
to
her
at
that
time
by
the
founding
of
Johns
Hopkins
University
within
walking
distance
of
home
.

and
although
it
was
a
school
for
men
only
,
it
afforded
Henrietta
an
opportunity
to
attend
its
public
lectures
.

Joseph
Jastrow
,
the
younger
son
of
the
distinguished
rabbi
,
Marcus
Jastrow
,
was
a
friendly
,
round-faced
fellow
with
a
little
mustache
,
whose
field
was
psychology
,
and
who
was
also
a
punster
and
a
jolly
tease
.

His
father
was
a
good
friend
of
Rabbi
Szold
,
and
Joe
lived
with
the
Szolds
for
a
while
.

Young
Morris
,
who
,
while
attending
the
University
of
Pennsylvania
,
also
taught
and
edited
a
paper
,
found
time
to
write
Henrietta
twenty-page
letters
on
everything
that
engaged
his
interest
,
from
the
acting
of
Sarah
Bernhardt
in
Philadelphia
to
his
reactions
to
the
comments
of
Sulamith
on
the
Jewish
reform
movement
being
promulgated
by
the
Hebrew
Union
College
in
Cincinnati
.

and
,
I
do
think
that
families
are
the
most
beautiful
things
in
all
the
world
,
burst
out
Jo
some
five
hundred
pages
later
in
that
popular
story
of
the
March
family
,
which
had
first
appeared
when
Henrietta
was
eight
;
;

and
each
stood
out
conspicuously
in
the
family
picture
.

but
both
groups
were
so
closely
knit
that
despite
individual
differences
the
family
life
in
both
cases
was
remarkably
similar
in
atmosphere
if
not
entirely
in
content
--
the
one
being
definitely
Jewish
and
the
other
vaguely
Christian
.

And
just
as
Laurie
Lawrence
was
first
attracted
to
bright
Jo
March
,
who
found
him
immature
by
her
high
standards
,
and
then
had
to
content
himself
with
her
younger
sister
Amy
,
so
Joe
Jastrow
,
who
had
also
been
writing
Henrietta
before
he
came
to
Johns
Hopkins
,
had
to
content
himself
with
her
younger
sister
,
pretty
Rachel
.

This
time
he
was
making
no
mistake
.

but
the
years
that
immediately
followed
were
to
be
extraordinarily
trying
,
both
for
Wright
and
his
Montenegrin
lady
.

At
last
her
lawyer
,
Arthur
D.
Cloud
,
gave
up
the
case
because
she
turned
down
three
successive
settlements
he
arranged
.

At
this
time
Miriam
Noel
appeared
,
urging
on
Constable
Henry
Pengally
,
whose
name
showed
him
to
be
a
descendant
of
the
Welsh
settlers
in
the
neighborhood
.

Miriam
now
ordered
Pengally
to
break
down
the
gate
,
but
he
said
he
really
couldn't
go
that
far
.

'
I
think
you
had
better
leave
'
!
!

and
it
gave
Miriam
Noel
a
fund
of
energy
like
that
of
a
person
inspired
to
complete
some
great
and
universal
work
of
art
.

But
surely
Michigan
Avenue
was
handsome
?
?

That
isn't
a
boulevard
,
it's
a
racetrack
!
!

This
is
a
horrible
way
to
live
,
Wright
went
on
.

You
are
being
strangled
by
traffic
.

He
was
then
asked
for
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
,
and
began
to
talk
trenchant
sense
,
though
private
anguish
showed
through
in
the
vehemence
of
his
manner
.

A
storm
did
take
place
that
night
,
and
fortunately
enough
,
it
included
a
cloudburst
that
helped
put
out
the
flames
.

Later
accounts
blamed
defective
wiring
for
starting
the
fire
;
;

Wright
set
his
loss
at
$200,000
,
a
figure
perhaps
justified
by
the
unique
character
of
the
house
that
had
been
ruined
,
and
the
faultless
taste
that
had
gone
into
the
selection
of
the
prints
and
other
things
that
were
destroyed
.

Amid
a
shortage
of
profitable
work
,
the
memory
of
Albert
Johnson's
$20,000
stood
out
in
lonely
grandeur
--
the
money
had
quickly
melted
away
.

While
this
was
under
consideration
,
dauntless
as
ever
Wright
set
about
the
building
of
Taliesin
3
.

nor
was
she
moved
by
a
letter
from
Wright
pointing
out
that
if
he
was
not
compelled
to
spend
money
on
useless
lawyer's
bills
,
useless
hotel
bills
,
and
useless
doctor's
bills
,
he
could
more
quickly
provide
Miriam
with
a
suitable
home
either
in
Los
Angeles
or
Paris
,
as
she
preferred
.

Miriam
sniffed
at
this
,
and
complained
that
Wright
had
said
unkind
things
about
her
to
reporters
.

I
do
not
suppose
you
ever
heard
of
F.
Scott
Fitzgerald
,
living
or
dead
,
and
moreover
I
do
not
suppose
that
,
even
if
you
had
,
his
legend
would
have
seemed
to
you
to
warrant
more
than
a
cluck
of
disapproval
.

But
he
was
no
man
in
the
moon
to
me
.

If
I
am
to
speak
the
whole
truth
about
my
knowledge
of
love
,
I
will
have
to
stop
trying
to
emulate
the
transcendant
nightingale
.

I
recoil
from
the
very
thought
.

You
probably
would
not
remember
,
since
you
never
seemed
to
remember
even
the
same
moments
as
I
,
much
less
their
intensity
,
one
sunny
midday
on
Fifth
Avenue
when
you
had
set
out
with
me
for
some
final
shopping
less
than
a
week
before
the
wedding
you
staged
for
me
with
such
reluctance
at
the
Farm
.

I
can
see
us
now
.

Said
:
There
are
things
I
must
tell
you
about
this
man
you
are
marrying
which
he
does
not
know
himself
.

What
I
fled
from
was
my
fear
of
what
,
unwittingly
,
you
might
betray
,
without
meaning
to
,
about
my
father
and
yourself
.

today
,
these
many
years
later
,
after
all
the
temptations
resisted
or
yielded
to
,
the
weasel
satisfactions
and
the
engulfing
dissatisfactions
since
endured
,
I
call
it
corrupting
still
.

You
,
I
could
swear
to
it
,
remained
innocent
in
this
sense
until
the
end
.

With
each
song
he
gave
verbal
footnotes
.

Often
these
listeners
would
refer
Sandburg
to
persons
who
had
similar
ballads
or
ditties
.

As
Sandburg
said
at
the
time
:
It
is
as
ancient
as
the
medieval
European
ballads
brought
to
the
Appalachian
Mountains
,
it
is
as
modern
as
skyscrapers
,
the
Volstead
Act
,
and
the
latest
oil
well
gusher
.

Even
when
he
is
called
upon
for
impromptu
remarks
,
he
has
notes
written
on
the
back
of
handy
envelopes
.

The
second
reason
for
his
popularity
is
his
complete
spontaneity
with
the
guitar
.

His
fingers
labor
heavily
on
the
strings
and
he
asked
for
my
help
in
disciplining
them
.

To
play
the
guitar
as
he
aspires
will
devour
his
three-fold
energy
as
a
historian
,
a
poet
and
a
singer
.

The
public's
identification
of
Carl
Sandburg
and
the
guitar
is
no
happenstance
.

Nor
does
Carl
reject
this
identity
.

They
went
to
the
pawnshop
of
Joseph
Miller
of
1162
Sixth
Avenue
.

Mr.
Miller
was
in
the
shop
,
the
Herald
Tribune
story
related
,
but
was
reluctant
to
have
anybody's
picture
taken
inside
,
because
his
business
was
too
'
confidential
'
for
pictures
.

He
wanted
Mr.
Sandburg
to
pose
with
one
of
the
guitars
he
had
displayed
behind
glass
in
the
center
of
his
shop
,
but
the
poet
eyed
this
somewhat
distastefully
.

That
was
all
he
had
to
say
.

One
fame
is
precious
and
luminous
;
;

another
is
a
bubble
of
a
bauble
.

She
has
shared
her
husband's
greatness
,
but
only
within
the
confines
of
their
home
;
;

Mrs.
Sandburg
received
a
Phi
Beta
Kappa
key
from
the
University
of
Chicago
and
she
was
busy
writing
and
teaching
when
she
met
Sandburg
.

Some
of
the
children
of
the
family
could
not
pronounce
this
name
and
called
her
Paula
,
a
soubriquet
Carl
liked
so
much
she
has
been
Paula
ever
since
.

If
there
was
ever
a
thought
in
her
mind
she
might
devote
her
life
to
religion
,
it
was
now
dispelled
.

He
legitimized
Paula
for
Lilian
Steichen
,
and
it
was
Paula
who
insisted
on
Carl
for
Charles
.

Carl
,
who
was
stationed
in
Appleton
,
Wisconsin
,
organizing
for
the
Social
Democrats
,
was
in
Berger's
office
and
made
it
his
business
to
escort
Paula
to
the
streetcar
.

(
After
graduation
from
the
University
of
Chicago
,
Paula
taught
for
two
years
in
the
normal
school
at
Valley
City
,
North
Dakota
,
then
two
years
at
Princeton
(
Illinois
)
Township
High
School
.

Never
until
in
this
work
of
S-D
organization
have
I
realized
and
felt
the
attitude
and
experience
of
a
Teacher
.

Certainly
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
that
the
United
States
has
no
intention
of
interfering
in
the
internal
affairs
of
any
nation
;
;

Now
this
concern
for
the
freedom
of
other
peoples
is
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
cement
which
has
allied
us
with
more
than
forty
other
nations
in
a
common
defense
effort
.

Not
for
a
moment
do
we
forget
that
our
own
fate
is
firmly
fastened
to
that
of
these
countries
;
;

This
is
a
problem
to
be
solved
not
by
America
alone
,
but
also
by
every
nation
cherishing
the
same
ideals
and
in
position
to
provide
help
.

No
longer
is
the
United
States
the
only
major
industrial
country
capable
of
providing
substantial
amounts
of
the
resources
so
urgently
needed
in
the
newly
developed
countries
.

To
us
and
to
every
nation
of
the
Free
World
,
rich
or
poor
,
these
qualities
are
necessary
today
as
never
before
if
we
are
to
march
together
to
greater
security
,
prosperity
and
peace
.

We
must
meet
this
situation
by
promoting
a
rising
volume
of
exports
and
world
trade
.

Moreover
,
progress
in
a
national
transformation
can
be
only
gradually
earned
;
;

there
is
no
easy
and
quick
way
to
follow
from
the
oxcart
to
the
jet
plane
.

Here
,
in
two
nations
alone
,
are
almost
five
hundred
million
people
,
all
working
,
and
working
hard
,
to
raise
their
standards
,
and
in
doing
so
,
to
make
of
themselves
a
strong
bulwark
against
the
spread
of
an
ideology
that
would
destroy
liberty
.

I
cannot
express
to
you
the
depth
of
my
conviction
that
,
in
our
own
and
free
world
interest
,
we
must
co-operate
with
others
to
help
these
people
achieve
their
legitimate
ambitions
,
as
expressed
in
their
different
multi-year
plans
.

A
common
meeting
ground
is
desirable
for
those
nations
which
are
prepared
to
assist
in
the
development
effort
.

The
goal
is
to
enlist
all
available
economic
resources
in
the
industrialized
Free
World
,
especially
private
investment
capital
.

Until
tangible
and
mutually
enforceable
arms
reduction
measures
are
worked
out
we
will
not
weaken
the
means
of
defending
our
institutions
.

It
is
my
studied
conviction
that
no
nation
will
ever
risk
general
war
against
us
unless
we
should
become
so
foolish
as
to
neglect
the
defense
forces
we
now
so
powerfully
support
.

During
the
past
year
,
our
long-range
striking
power
,
unmatched
today
in
manned
bombers
,
has
taken
on
new
strength
as
the
Atlas
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
has
entered
the
operational
inventory
.

Such
performance
is
a
great
tribute
to
American
scientists
and
engineers
,
who
in
the
past
five
years
have
had
to
telescope
time
and
technology
to
develop
these
long-range
ballistic
missiles
,
where
America
had
none
before
.

Moreover
,
I
have
directed
that
steps
be
taken
to
program
on
a
longer
range
basis
our
military
assistance
to
these
allies
.

We
note
that
,
first
,
America
has
already
made
great
contributions
in
the
past
two
years
to
the
world's
fund
of
knowledge
of
astrophysics
and
space
science
.

Today
our
surging
strength
is
apparent
to
everyone
.

Here
,
he
openly
attacked
Bang-Jensen
and
referred
to
his
aberrant
conduct
.

He
had
always
done
well
.

We
were
given
a
job
and
we
carried
it
out
,
and
later
,
his
case
was
taken
up
by
the
Disciplinary
Committee
.

What
did
you
think
about
his
mental
state
?
?

What
do
you
mean
?
?

For
an
instant
he
glared
speechless
at
Marshall
.

Listen
,
he
said
.

I
thought
the
entire
report
was
going
to
be
confidential
from
beginning
to
end
.

It
was
getting
so
that
we
,
the
Committee
,
were
being
tried
.

This
cited
Bang-Jensen's
'
aberrant
conduct
'
.

What
was
the
list
?
?

Bang-Jensen
never
explained
what
the
documents
or
papers
were
that
he
had
in
his
possession
.

I've
served
as
a
counsel
for
the
U.N.
for
some
years
,
specializing
particularly
in
real
estate
matters
or
other
problems
that
the
regular
U.N.
legal
staff
might
not
be
equipped
to
handle
.

One
was
an
article
on
the
U.N.
by
Alice
Widener
from
the
Cincinnati
Enquirer
.

Gross
pointed
to
the
Manley
story
.

I
know
Ches
,
he's
a
friend
of
mine
.

The
case
was
that
Bang-Jensen
came
up
to
Shann
claiming
he
had
found
further
errors
in
the
report
.

And
after
all
this
,
Shann
went
over
all
that
Bang-Jensen
had
brought
up
.

Gross
stopped
briefly
,
then
went
on
.

He
has
felt
terrible
about
all
this
.

When
I
speak
of
how
Shann
felt
,
I
know
well
.

It
said
in
part
:

We
were
requested
by
the
Secretary
General
,
as
I
understand
it
,
to
discuss
with
you
such
matters
as
appear
to
us
to
be
relevant
,
and
we
are
not
of
course
either
a
formal
group
or
a
committee
in
the
sense
of
being
guided
by
any
rules
or
regulations
of
the
Secretariat
.

The
only
rules
which
I
think
we
shall
follow
will
be
those
of
common
sense
,
justice
,
and
fairness
.

Marshall
pondered
the
reason
for
this
,
and
pondered
too
the
replacement
of
one
member
of
the
three-man
group
.

The
sickness
was
gone
and
,
after
all
,
the
two
young
couples
were
on
their
honeymoon
.

Everything
tasted
differently
from
what
it
does
on
land
and
those
things
I
was
most
fond
of
at
home
,
I
loathed
the
most
here
,
Ann
noted
.

She
was
now
enjoying
the
voyage
very
much
.

They
were
sailing
round
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
;
;

I
have
been
so
weary
of
the
excessive
rocking
of
the
vessel
,
and
the
almost
intolerable
smell
after
the
rain
,
that
I
have
done
little
more
than
lounge
on
the
bed
for
several
days
.

Land
was
near
,
and
on
June
12
,
one
hundred
and
fourteen
days
after
leaving
America
,
they
actually
saw
,
twenty
miles
away
,
the
coast
of
Orissa
.

Captain
Heard
gave
orders
for
the
ship
to
be
anchored
in
the
Bay
of
Bengal
until
he
could
obtain
the
services
of
a
reputable
pilot
to
steer
her
through
the
shallow
waters
.

Relieved
of
the
major
part
of
his
responsibility
for
the
safety
of
the
ship
,
the
pilot's
oaths
became
fewer
.

Slowly
she
moved
up
the
Hooghli
River
,
a
mouth
of
the
mighty
Ganges
,
toward
Calcutta
.

Out
came
the
journal
and
in
it
went
Ann's
own
description
of
the
scene
:

They
are
very
small
,
and
in
the
form
of
haystacks
,
without
either
chimney
or
windows
.

The
grass
and
fields
of
rice
are
perfectly
green
,
and
herds
of
cattle
are
everywhere
feeding
on
the
banks
of
the
river
,
and
the
natives
are
scattered
about
differently
employed
.

With
childlike
innocence
she
wrote
of
the
Indians
as
walking
with
fruit
and
umbrellas
in
their
hands
,
with
the
tawny
children
around
them
.

The
noise
stunned
her
.

Crowds
flocked
through
the
waterfront
streets
chattering
loudly
in
their
strange-sounding
Bengali
tongue
.

Harriet's
mouth
watered
with
anticipation
when
after
months
of
dreaming
she
sat
down
at
last
to
her
much-craved
milk
and
fresh
bread
.

Cautiously
she
sampled
her
first
pineapple
and
another
fruit
whose
taste
she
likened
to
that
of
a
rich
pear
.

When
Captain
John
Gibault
of
Salem
had
visited
Burma
in
1793
his
ship
,
the
Astra
,
had
been
promptly
commandeered
and
taken
by
her
captors
up
the
Irrawaddy
River
.

All
Captain
Gibault
took
back
to
Salem
were
a
few
items
for
the
town's
East
India
Museum
.

She
describes
,
first
,
the
imaginary
reaction
of
a
foreigner
puzzled
by
this
unseasonable
exultation
;
;

On
December
21
,
the
day
that
the
Irish
House
of
Commons
petitioned
for
removal
of
Sir
Constantine
Phipps
,
their
Tory
Lord
Chancellor
,
Molesworth
reportedly
made
this
remark
on
the
defense
of
Phipps
by
Convocation
:
They
that
have
turned
the
world
upside
down
,
are
come
hither
also
.

Swift
,
in
the
Dublin
edition
of
A
Preface
to
the
Bishop
of
Sarum's
Introduction
,
indicated
his
feelings
by
including
Molesworth
,
along
with
Toland
,
Tindal
,
and
Collins
,
in
the
group
of
those
who
,
like
Burnet
,
are
engaged
in
attacking
all
Convocations
of
the
clergy
.

The
preliminaries
ended
with
the
publication
of
Steele's
Crisis
on
January
19
,
and
from
that
point
on
the
fight
proceeded
at
a
rapid
pace
.

Certainly
it
is
the
most
pretentious
and
elaborate
.

To
this
end
,
the
first
and
longest
section
of
the
tract
cites
all
the
laws
enacted
since
the
Revolution
to
defend
England
against
the
Arbitrary
Power
of
a
Popish
Prince
.

Treasonable
books
striking
at
the
Hanoverian
Succession
,
he
complains
,
are
allowed
to
pass
unnoticed
.

Steele
apparently
professed
his
sentiments
in
this
book
too
openly
and
honestly
for
his
own
good
,
since
the
government
was
soon
to
use
it
as
evidence
against
him
in
his
trial
before
the
House
.

Defoe
then
commented
,
If
they
Could
Draw
that
young
Gentleman
into
Their
Measures
They
would
show
themselves
quickly
,
for
they
are
not
asham'd
to
Say
They
want
only
a
head
to
Make
a
beginning
.

by
this
term
he
means
to
ridicule
their
professions
of
acting
in
the
interest
of
the
Church
despite
their
own
education
and
manner
of
life
--
a
gibe
,
in
other
words
,
at
the
Presbyterianism
in
Harley's
family
and
at
Bolingbroke's
reputed
impiety
.

The
Tory
leaders
,
he
insinuates
,
are
cynically
using
the
Church
as
a
political
By-word
to
increase
party
friction
and
keep
themselves
in
power
.

Once
more
,
in
other
words
,
Steele
is
said
to
be
indebted
to
Swift
for
his
wit
;
;

If
nothing
else
,
at
least
two
good
songs
came
out
of
the
project
,
Out
Of
This
World
and
June
Comes
Around
Every
Year
.

Johnny
Mercer
practically
grew
up
with
the
sound
of
jazz
and
the
blues
in
his
ears
.

The
lyricist's
father
was
a
lawyer
who
had
branched
out
into
real
estate
.

His
second
wife
,
Lillian
,
was
the
mother
of
John
H.
Mercer
.

One
day
he
followed
the
Irish
Jasper
Greens
,
the
town
band
,
to
a
picnic
and
spent
the
entire
day
listening
,
while
his
family
spent
the
day
looking
.

The
maid
then
told
her
,
Because
he
fired
me
.

If
his
scholarship
and
formal
musicianship
were
not
all
they
might
have
been
,
Mercer
demonstrated
at
an
early
age
that
he
was
gifted
with
a
remarkable
ear
for
rhythm
and
dialect
.

During
the
summers
,
while
he
was
still
in
school
,
Mercer
worked
for
his
father's
firm
as
a
messenger
boy
.

Some
years
later
the
bank
handling
the
Mercer
liquidation
received
a
check
for
$300,000
,
enough
to
clear
up
the
debt
.

Mercer
is
supposed
to
have
refused
it
with
,
Anyone
who
wears
a
square
monacle
must
be
affected
!
!

For
him
Mercer
produced
the
lyric
to
Out
Of
Breath
Scared
To
Death
Of
You
,
introduced
in
that
most
successful
of
all
the
Gaieties
,
by
Sterling
Holloway
.

The
Mercers
took
up
residence
in
Brooklyn
,
and
Mercer
found
a
regular
job
in
Wall
Street
misplacing
stocks
and
bonds
.

He
had
yet
to
meet
Harold
Arlen
,
for
although
they
had
collaborated
on
Satan's
Li'l
Lamb
,
Mercer
and
Harburg
had
worked
from
a
lead
sheet
the
composer
had
furnished
them
.

The
lyric
,
Mercer
remembers
,
was
tailored
to
fit
the
unusual
melody
.

After
leaving
Whiteman
,
Mercer
joined
the
Benny
Goodman
band
as
a
vocalist
.

The
countrywide
success
of
Lazybones
and
And
The
Angels
Sing
could
only
lead
to
Hollywood
,
where
,
besides
Harold
Arlen
,
Mercer
collaborated
with
Harry
Warren
,
Jimmy
Van
Heusen
,
Richard
Whiting
,
Walter
Donaldson
,
Jerome
Kern
,
and
Arthur
Schwartz
.

Mercer
has
also
written
both
music
and
lyrics
for
several
songs
.

When
Johnny
Mercer
and
Harold
Arlen
began
their
collaboration
in
1940
,
Mercer
,
like
Arlen
,
had
several
substantial
film
songs
to
his
credit
,
among
them
Hooray
For
Hollywood
,
Ride
,
Tenderfoot
,
Ride
,
Have
You
Got
Any
Castles
,
Baby
?
?

His
casual
,
dreamlike
working
methods
,
often
as
not
in
absentia
,
were
an
abrupt
change
from
Harburg's
,
so
that
Arlen
had
to
adjust
again
to
another
approach
to
collaboration
.

Speaking
of
his
work
with
Johnny
Mercer
,
Arlen
says
,
Our
working
habits
were
strange
.

While
Arlen
and
Mercer
collaborated
on
Hot
Nocturne
,
Mercer
worked
also
with
Arthur
Schwartz
on
another
film
,
Navy
Blues
.

This
grew
into
the
song
Big
Time
Comin'
.

The
Negro
composer
Hall
Johnson
studied
the
American-Negro
Suite
and
said
of
it
,
Of
all
the
many
songs
written
by
white
composers
and
employing
what
claims
to
be
a
Negroid
idiom
in
both
words
and
music
,
these
six
songs
by
Harold
Arlen
and
Ted
Koehler
easily
stand
far
out
above
the
rest
.

It
had
a
single
porcelain
stall
and
but
one
cabinet
for
the
chairing
of
the
bards
.

Mr.
Herford's
appearance
was
that
of
a
frustrated
gnome
.

He
seemed
timid
(
at
first
,
)
wore
nose
glasses
from
which
a
black
ribbon
dangled
,
and
was
no
bigger
than
a
jockey
.

Robinson
asked
Herford
to
escort
him
to
the
club's
lavatory
before
they
sat
down
for
a
highball
and
a
game
of
cards
.

He
had
barely
assumed
his
stance
there
when
a
fat
fellow
charged
through
the
doorway
.

The
artist-author
said
nothing
,
but
stood
to
one
side
.

--
to
go
to
the
door
.

Mr.
Herford
touched
the
fat
man's
arm
.

I
was
in
charge
of
the
arrangements
--
which
were
soon
enough
disarranged
.

The
Hetman's
physical
aspects
were
not
those
of
a
savage
rider
of
the
steppes
.

He
had
worked
in
the
newspaper
business
since
he
was
nineteen
years
old
,
always
for
the
Hearst
service
.

It's
bigger
than
the
Armistice
.

One
day
he
assigned
me
to
lay
bare
a
plot
by
the
Duponts
to
supply
munitions
to
a
wholly
fictitious
revolution
he
said
was
about
to
occur
in
Cuba
.

It's
bigger
than
the
Armistice
.

I
worked
for
a
day
on
this
plainly
ridiculous
assignment
and
consulted
several
of
my
own
well-informed
sources
.

I
shall
tell
of
it
later
on
.

Most
of
my
stories
were
obtained
by
simply
seeking
out
the
person
who
could
give
me
the
facts
,
and
not
as
a
rule
by
playing
clever
tricks
.

I
explained
my
state
of
mind
to
artist
Winsor
McCay
and
to
Bugs
Baer
.

Mr.
Baer
obtained
a
supply
of
crepe
hair
and
spirit-gum
from
an
actor
at
the
Friars
.

This
,
together
with
a
derby
hat
and
horn-rim
eyeglasses
,
gave
me
the
appearance
of
a
Russian
nihilist
.

We
are
ready
for
your
next
mysterious
assignment
,
said
Mr.
Baer
to
the
Hetman
.

Where
to
,
sir
?
?

The
Hetman
told
me
to
take
the
story
over
the
phone
and
to
write
it
.

While
I
was
sitting
at
one
of
the
rewrite
telephones
with
my
derby
and
my
great
beard
,
Arthur
Brisbane
whizzed
in
with
some
editorial
copy
in
his
hand
.

He
campaigned
successfully
for
the
riddance
of
Death
Avenue
and
also
brought
about
the
ending
of
pollution
of
metropolitan
beaches
by
sewage
.

One
finds
it
difficult
to
pass
censure
on
the
lonely
figure
who
waited
for
days
for
a
saving
word
from
his
zealously
served
idol
,
W.R.
Hearst
.

Much
to
Damon
Runyon's
amazement
,
as
well
as
my
own
,
I
got
along
splendidly
with
the
Hetman
;
;

Not
long
after
Colonel
Van
Hamm
had
foisted
me
on
the
Watson
staff
I
received
a
salary
raise
and
a
contract
on
the
Hetman's
recommendation
.

Don't
bother
to
look
any
further
.

I
cannot
remember
Dr.
Gregory's
reply
,
if
,
indeed
,
he
made
one
.

She
kept
the
dolls
on
the
Lincoln
bed
.

John
was
away
at
school
most
of
the
time
.

I
still
have
the
dress
,
and
I
hope
to
give
it
to
the
Smithsonian
Institution
as
a
memento
,
or
,
as
I
more
fondly
hope
,
to
present
it
to
a
museum
containing
articles
showing
the
daily
lives
of
the
Presidents
--
if
I
can
get
it
organized
.

Mama
didn't
know
what
to
do
--
whether
to
tell
on
Rob
Roy
or
not
--
since
she
had
the
ear
of
Mrs.
Coolidge
more
than
the
other
maids
.

He
would
not
make
a
sound
until
the
President
had
wakened
and
left
for
the
office
;
;

His
signal
was
for
the
other
dogs
to
come
running
,
but
it
was
also
the
signal
for
Mama
and
the
other
maids
to
watch
out
.

Rob
Roy
was
well
aware
of
the
importance
of
this
mission
,
and
he
would
walk
in
front
of
the
President
,
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
.

The
butlers
were
amused
because
when
the
Stearns
were
there
,
the
President
would
say
grace
at
breakfast
.

A
new
bill
had
been
passed
under
Harding
that
designated
the
Government
,
rather
than
the
President
,
as
the
tab-lifter
for
official
meals
.

He
caused
a
lot
of
talk
when
he
also
chose
the
breakfast
hour
to
have
the
barber
come
in
and
trim
his
hair
while
he
ate
.

You
can
imagine
that
he
got
pretty
good
service
.

The
first
royalty
whom
Mama
ever
waited
on
in
the
White
House
was
Queen
Marie
of
Rumania
,
who
came
to
a
State
dinner
given
in
her
honor
on
October
21
,
1926
.

She
was
not
an
overnight
guest
in
the
White
House
,
but
Mr.
Ike
Hoover
,
the
chief
usher
,
had
Mama
check
her
fur
coat
when
she
came
in
,
and
take
care
of
her
needs
.

She
used
to
tell
me
,
When
I
stand
there
and
look
at
the
flag
blowing
this
way
and
that
way
,
I
have
the
wonderful
,
safe
feeling
that
Americans
are
protected
no
matter
which
way
the
wind
blows
.

One
person
she
helped
was
my
brother
.

Mama
had
told
her
how
Emmett's
lungs
had
been
affected
when
he
was
gassed
in
the
war
.

Taking
a
personal
interest
,
she
had
the
doctor
assigned
to
the
White
House
,
Dr.
James
Coupal
,
look
Emmett
over
.

When
Mrs.
Coolidge
was
in
mourning
,
she
did
not
wear
black
.

Mrs.
Coolidge
looked
down
,
saw
Mama's
horrified
expression
and
quickly
let
the
whole
thing
fall
to
the
floor
.

In
accounting
for
realism
or
distortion
two
sets
of
factors
can
be
usefully
distinguished
:
current
intelligence
;
;

He
may
have
entered
the
situation
with
predispositions
that
prepared
him
to
act
uncritically
in
the
press
of
affairs
.

I
am
deliberately
raising
the
policy
problems
involved
in
Gentile-Jewish
relations
.

It
is
beyond
the
province
of
this
epilogue
to
cover
policy
questions
of
such
depth
and
range
.

It
is
not
difficult
to
anticipate
circumstances
in
which
negative
tensions
will
cumulate
;
;

We
are
learning
how
to
do
these
things
in
some
of
the
vast
organized
structures
of
modern
society
;
;

During
intercrisis
periods
the
educational
facilities
of
the
community
have
the
possibility
of
remolding
the
perspectives
and
altering
the
behavior
of
vast
numbers
of
human
beings
of
every
age
and
condition
.

self-discovery
calls
for
an
open
,
permissive
,
inquiring
posture
of
self-observation
.

The
second
timely
part
of
this
sketch
of
literature
and
the
search
for
identity
has
to
do
with
the
difference
between
good
and
enduring
literary
works
and
the
ephemeral
mass
culture
products
of
today
.

In
the
range
and
variety
of
characters
who
,
in
their
literary
lives
,
get
along
all
right
with
life
styles
one
never
imagined
possible
,
there
is
an
implicit
lesson
in
differentiation
.

One
would
need
to
test
this
proposition
carefully
;
;

It
is
possible
that
the
study
of
literature
affects
the
conscience
,
the
morality
,
the
sensitivity
to
some
code
of
right
and
wrong
.

I
am
not
aware
of
great
attention
by
any
of
these
authors
or
by
the
psychotherapeutic
profession
to
the
role
of
literary
study
in
the
development
of
conscience
--
most
of
their
attention
is
to
a
pre-literate
period
of
life
,
or
,
for
the
theologians
of
course
,
to
the
influence
of
religion
.

Probably
the
most
important
thing
to
focus
on
is
not
the
development
of
conscience
,
which
may
well
be
almost
beyond
the
reach
of
literature
,
but
the
contents
of
conscience
,
the
code
which
is
imparted
to
the
developed
or
immature
conscience
available
.

Literature
may
be
said
to
give
people
a
sense
of
purpose
,
dedication
,
mission
,
significance
.

Men
seem
almost
universally
to
want
a
sense
of
function
,
that
is
,
a
feeling
that
their
existence
makes
a
difference
to
someone
,
living
or
unborn
,
close
and
immediate
or
generalized
.

A
need
so
deeply
planted
,
asking
for
direction
,
so
to
speak
,
is
likely
to
be
gratified
by
the
vivid
examples
and
heroic
proportions
of
literature
.

Let
us
differentiate
a
few
of
these
ideas
.

It
is
possible
that
the
idea
of
enrichment
of
emotion
is
a
fifth
idea
.

Richards'
view
of
the
aesthetic
experience
might
constitute
a
sixth
variety
:
for
him
it
constitutes
,
in
part
,
the
organization
of
impulses
.

William
Wimsatt
and
Cleanth
Brooks
,
it
seems
to
me
,
have
a
penetrating
insight
into
the
way
in
which
this
control
is
effected
:
For
if
we
say
poetry
is
to
talk
of
beauty
and
love
(
and
yet
not
aim
at
exciting
erotic
emotion
or
even
an
emotion
of
Platonic
esteem
)
and
if
it
is
to
talk
of
anger
and
murder
(
and
yet
not
aim
at
arousing
anger
and
indignation
)
--
then
it
may
be
that
the
poetic
way
of
dealing
with
these
emotions
will
not
be
any
kind
of
intensification
,
compounding
,
or
magnification
,
or
any
direct
assault
upon
the
affections
at
all
.

These
are
,
if
the
research
is
done
with
subtlety
and
skill
,
researchable
topics
,
but
the
research
is
missing
.

Among
other
things
it
means
perception
,
discrimination
,
sensitivity
to
subtle
differences
.

It
is
the
obverse
of
triviality
,
shallowness
,
emotional
anaesthesia
.

The
late
R.
G.
Collingwood
,
a
philosopher
whose
work
has
proved
helpful
to
many
students
of
literature
,
once
wrote
:
:

The
natural
and
primary
aesthetic
attitude
is
to
enjoy
contemporary
art
,
to
despise
and
dislike
the
art
of
the
recent
past
,
and
wholly
to
ignore
everything
else
.

Of
course
,
it
goes
without
saying
that
no
student
of
ideas
can
justifiably
ignore
the
contemporary
scene
.

He
will
frequently
return
to
it
.

The
continuities
,
contrasts
,
and
similarities
discernible
when
past
and
present
are
surveyed
together
are
inexhaustible
and
the
one
is
often
understood
through
the
other
.

The
knowledge
in
virtue
of
which
a
man
is
an
historian
is
a
knowledge
of
what
the
evidence
at
his
disposal
proves
about
certain
events
.

Finally
we
may
note
that
the
idea
appears
in
educational
theory
where
its
influence
is
at
present
widespread
.

Perhaps
the
most
powerful
and
most
frequently
recurring
literary
influence
on
the
Western
world
has
been
that
of
the
Old
and
New
Testament
.

Certainly
one
of
the
most
important
comments
that
can
be
made
upon
the
spiritual
and
cultural
life
of
any
period
of
Western
civilization
during
the
past
sixteen
or
seventeen
centuries
has
to
do
with
the
way
in
which
its
leaders
have
read
and
interpreted
the
Bible
.

A
contrast
of
the
scripture
reading
of
,
let
us
say
,
St.
Augustine
,
John
Bunyan
,
and
Thomas
Jefferson
,
all
three
of
whom
found
in
such
study
a
real
source
of
enlightenment
,
can
tell
us
a
great
deal
about
these
three
men
and
the
age
that
each
represented
and
helped
bring
to
conscious
expression
.

If
within
one
year
you
can
make
a
success
out
of
the
American
,
you
can
practically
name
your
own
salary
thereafter
.

Of
course
,
if
you
don't
make
the
American
a
success
,
Hearst
will
have
no
further
use
for
you
.

Hearst's
luck
was
even
poorer
when
he
had
a
chat
with
Franklin
K.
Lane
,
a
prominent
California
journalist
and
reform
politician
,
whom
he
asked
for
his
support
.

Mr.
Lane
,
Hearst
said
,
if
you
ever
wish
anything
that
I
can
do
,
all
you
will
have
to
do
will
be
to
send
me
a
telegram
asking
,
and
it
will
be
done
.

Hearst
saw
his
wife
and
child
,
sent
a
joyful
message
to
his
mother
in
California
,
and
soon
returned
to
Washington
,
where
on
April
22
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
opened
his
mouth
in
Congress
.

What
I
want
is
to
have
this
evidence
come
before
Congress
and
if
the
Attorney
General
does
not
report
it
,
as
I
am
very
sure
he
won't
,
as
he
has
refused
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
,
I
then
wish
that
a
committee
of
seven
Representatives
be
appointed
with
power
to
take
the
evidence
.

Hatred
tied
his
hands
in
Congress
.

But
his
increasing
strength
in
the
West
looked
menacing
.

It
caused
Henry
Watterson
to
sound
a
blast
in
his
Louisville
Courier-Journal
:

It
would
be
a
disgrace
,
and
,
as
I
have
already
said
to
the
people
of
Tennessee
,
if
Hearst
is
nominated
,
we
may
as
well
pen
a
dispatch
,
and
send
it
back
from
the
field
of
battle
:
'
All
is
lost
,
including
our
honor
'
.

A
lone
pro-Hearst
voice
from
New
York
City
was
that
of
William
Devery
,
who
had
been
expelled
as
a
Tammany
leader
but
still
claimed
strong
influence
in
his
own
district
.

Hearst
won
the
Iowa
state
convention
,
but
ran
into
a
bitter
battle
in
Indiana
before
losing
to
Parker
,
drawing
an
angry
statement
from
Indiana's
John
W.
Kern
:

We
are
menaced
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
Republic
by
the
open
and
unblushing
effort
of
a
multi-millionaire
to
purchase
the
Presidential
nomination
.

In
his
fight
for
the
Illinois
and
Indiana
delegations
,
Hearst
made
several
trips
to
Chicago
to
confer
with
Andrew
Lawrence
,
the
former
San
Francisco
Examiner
man
who
was
now
his
Chicago
kingpin
,
and
once
to
meet
with
Bryan
.

Never
mind
,
thank
you
,
he
said
.

I'll
show
you
,
Hearst
replied
,
grinning
.

When
Nan
Patterson
,
a
stunning
and
money-minded
chorus
girl
who
had
appeared
in
a
Floradora
road
show
,
rode
down
Broadway
in
a
hansom
cab
with
her
married
lover
,
Frank
Young
,
she
stopped
the
cab
to
disclose
that
Young
had
been
shot
dead
,
tearfully
insisting
that
he
had
shot
himself
although
experts
said
he
could
not
have
done
so
.

The
outstanding
example
was
in
Garibaldi
And
The
Thousand
,
where
he
made
use
of
unpublished
papers
of
Lord
John
Russell
and
English
consular
materials
to
reveal
the
motives
which
led
the
British
government
to
permit
Garibaldi
to
cross
the
Straits
of
Messina
.

Trevelyan's
Manin
And
The
Venetian
Revolution
Of
1848
,
his
last
major
volume
on
an
Italian
theme
,
was
written
in
a
minor
key
.

If
it
is
not
one
of
his
best
books
,
it
can
only
be
considered
unsatisfactory
when
compared
with
his
own
Garibaldi
.

Already
Trevelyan
had
begun
to
parallel
his
nineteenth-century
Italian
studies
with
several
works
on
English
figures
of
the
same
period
.

Of
the
two
,
The
Life
Of
Bright
is
incomparably
the
better
biography
.

It
is
a
Whig
history
of
the
Tory
reaction
which
preceded
the
Reform
Bill
of
1832
,
and
it
uses
the
figure
of
Grey
to
give
some
unity
to
the
narrative
.

And
Grey's
Northumberland
background
was
close
to
Trevelyan's
own
.

Some
historians
have
found
his
point
of
view
not
to
their
taste
,
others
have
complained
that
he
makes
the
Tory
tradition
appear
contemptible
rather
than
intelligible
,
while
a
sympathetic
critic
has
remarked
that
the
intricate
interplay
of
social
dynamics
and
political
activity
of
which
,
at
times
,
politicians
are
the
ignorant
marionettes
is
not
a
field
for
the
exercise
of
his
talents
.

Research
in
the
period
of
Grey
and
Bright
led
naturally
to
a
more
ambitious
work
.

But
after
1832
,
the
narrative
tends
to
lose
its
balanced
,
many-sided
quality
and
to
become
a
medley
of
topics
,
often
unconnected
by
any
single
thread
.

In
1924
Trevelyan
traveled
to
the
United
States
,
where
he
delivered
the
Lowell
lectures
at
Harvard
University
.

Trevelyan's
excursions
into
contemporary
history
were
rarely
happy
ones
.

But
as
a
stimulating
,
provocative
interpretation
of
the
broad
sweep
of
English
development
it
is
incomparable
.

Living
pictures
of
the
early
boroughs
,
country
life
in
Tudor
and
Stuart
times
,
the
impact
of
the
industrial
revolution
compete
with
sensitive
surveys
of
language
and
literature
,
the
common
law
,
parliamentary
development
.

Like
most
major
works
of
synthesis
,
The
History
Of
England
is
informed
by
the
positive
views
of
a
first-class
mind
,
and
this
is
surely
a
major
work
.

Like
his
volume
on
Wycliffe
,
the
work
was
accompanied
by
the
publication
of
a
selected
group
of
documents
,
in
this
case
illustrative
of
the
history
of
Queen
Anne's
reign
down
to
1707
.

In
four
opening
chapters
reminiscent
of
Macaulay's
famous
third
chapter
,
Trevelyan
surveys
the
state
of
England
at
the
opening
of
the
eighteenth
century
.

If
only
for
this
modest
masterpiece
of
military
history
,
Blenheim
is
likely
to
be
read
and
reread
long
after
newer
interpretations
have
perhaps
altered
our
picture
of
the
Marlborough
wars
.

Questions
came
to
me
from
all
sides
about
my
world
citizenship
activities
.

Listen
please
,
I
called
to
the
students
in
French
.

I
thank
you
most
heartily
for
being
here
.

Is
this
then
the
frontier
?
?

But
I
have
no
permission
to
re-enter
France
,
and
I
have
just
left
,
I
told
him
.

I
must
then
be
standing
on
the
line
between
France
and
Germany
.

But
if
there
is
no
line
,
how
can
there
be
two
countries
?
?

You
have
just
given
me
permission
to
leave
France
,
which
I
did
.

Mais
non
,
the
Interior
Ministry
man
coaxed
,
you
may
come
back
to
Strasbourg
,
now
,
if
you
wish
.

And
Bravo
,
Garry
,
continue
!
!

The
students
crowded
around
asking
questions
,
slapping
me
on
the
back
,
and
generally
being
friendly
.

I
have
a
small
sports
shop
in
Strasbourg
.

Some
students
from
the
University
returned
around
six
with
a
large
pot
containing
enough
hot
soup
to
last
me
a
week
.

Her
name
was
Esther
Peter
.

I
was
delighted
to
make
that
personal
contact
in
such
trying
and
unusual
circumstances
.

As
the
field
on
which
my
tent
was
pitched
was
a
favorite
natural
playground
for
the
kids
of
the
neighborhood
,
I
had
made
many
friends
among
them
,
taking
part
in
their
after-school
games
and
trying
desperately
to
translate
Grimm's
Fairy
Tales
into
an
understandable
French
as
we
gathered
around
the
fire
in
front
of
the
tent
.

It
was
a
merry
if
somewhat
soggy
Christmas
for
me
that
year
.

In
the
mail
were
invitations
to
speak
at
the
universities
of
Cologne
,
Heidelberg
,
and
Baden-Baden
.

No
matter
how
large
the
fire
,
I
couldn't
seem
to
shake
off
the
chill
that
day
.

On
the
evening
of
December
27th
,
Esther
noticed
my
pallid
look
and
rasping
voice
.

He
advised
immediate
hospitalization
.

I
wouldn't
hear
of
it
because
it
meant
giving
up
the
line
,
though
I
realized
I
was
in
poor
shape
physically
.

Without
preliminaries
,
Esther
asked
him
,
If
you
are
a
world
citizen
,
will
you
take
Garry
Davis'
place
in
his
tent
while
he
goes
to
the
hospital
?
?

But
of
course
,
with
pleasure
,
he
replied
.

Now
come
,
Garry
,
we
must
go
quickly
.

His
hat
was
gone
,
the
tears
were
streaming
from
his
eyes
.

He
never
knew
how
he
got
there
.

Slocum
made
his
reconnaissanace
the
next
morning
,
found
the
town
empty
,
accepted
the
surrender
of
the
mayor
and
occupied
the
city
a
little
before
noon
.

Thomas
thanked
his
men
for
their
tenacity
of
purpose
,
unmurmuring
endurance
,
cheerful
obedience
,
brilliant
heroism
and
high
qualities
in
battle
.

He
supposed
the
military
world
would
approve
of
his
accomplishment
.

Lincoln
was
sure
that
he
would
not
be
re-elected
.

Actually
the
Atlanta
campaign
was
a
military
failure
.

Men
were
killed
in
their
camps
,
at
their
meals
and
in
their
sleep
.

He
never
saw
that
it
was
a
complement
to
his
infantry
and
not
a
substitute
for
it
.

A
horse
needed
twenty
pounds
of
food
a
day
but
the
infantryman
got
along
with
two
pounds
.

So
Sherman
tried
a
compromise
.

He
would
ship
by
rail
five
pounds
per
day
per
animal
and
the
other
fifteen
pounds
that
were
needed
could
be
picked
up
off
the
country
.

Its
climactic
role
was
to
pursue
and
demoralize
a
defeated
enemy
but
this
chance
never
came
in
the
Atlanta
campaign
.

Thomas
tried
hard
to
have
his
cavalry
ready
for
the
test
it
was
to
meet
,
but
his
plans
were
wrecked
when
it
was
forced
into
a
campaign
without
optimum
mobility
and
with
its
commander
stripped
from
it
.

Sherman
knew
the
uses
of
cavalry
as
well
as
Thomas
but
he
imagined
a
moving
base
with
infantry
wings
instead
of
cavalry
wings
.

To
relieve
the
itch
and
sweat
galls
,
the
men
got
into
the
water
whenever
they
could
and
since
each
sizable
stream
was
generally
the
dividing
line
between
the
armies
the
pickets
declared
a
private
truce
while
the
men
went
swimming
.

Most
of
the
Rebels
got
away
since
they
could
make
better
time
through
the
stiff
brush
than
their
naked
pursuers
.

That
was
a
very
absurd
and
annoying
situation
in
which
I
was
placed
by
W.
M.'s
curious
methods
of
handling
me
.

This
prospect
did
not
please
Mrs.
King
any
more
than
did
the
possibility
that
her
daughter
might
marry
a
Bohemian
,
but
she
used
it
to
suggest
to
Thompson
that
,
It
is
not
in
her
nature
to
love
you
.

For
his
part
,
Thompson
had
explained
in
a
previous
letter
that
there
would
be
nothing
but
an
honorable
friendship
between
Katie
and
himself
.

She
regretted
what
she
described
as
the
unwarrantable
&
unnecessary
check
to
their
friendship
and
said
that
she
felt
that
they
understood
one
another
perfectly
.

Katherine
Douglas
King
The
invitation
was
accepted
and
other
letters
followed
,
in
which
she
spoke
of
her
concern
for
his
health
and
her
delight
in
seeing
him
so
much
at
home
among
the
crippled
children
she
served
.

Perhaps
Mrs.
Meynell
would
do
me
the
undeserved
kindness
to
keep
my
own
copy
of
the
first
edition
of
my
first
book
,
with
all
its
mementos
of
her
and
the
dear
ones
.

Last
,
not
least
,
there
are
some
poems
which
K.
King
sent
me
(
addressed
to
herself
)
when
I
was
preparing
a
fresh
volume
,
asking
me
to
include
them
.

I
wish
you
would
return
them
to
her
.

O
my
genius
,
young
and
ripening
,
you
would
swear
,
--
when
I
wrote
them
;
;

What
has
it
all
come
to
?
?

From
the
outset
,
she
must
have
realized
that
marriage
with
him
was
out
of
the
question
,
and
although
she
was
displeased
by
the
unwarrantable
interference
,
it
seems
probable
that
she
did
agree
with
her
mother's
suggestion
that
the
poet
was
perhaps
a
man
most
fitted
to
live
&
die
solitary
,
&
in
the
love
only
of
the
Highest
Lover
.

Whether
or
not
Danchin
is
correct
in
suggesting
that
Thompson's
resumption
of
the
opium
habit
also
dates
from
this
period
is
,
of
course
,
a
matter
of
conjecture
.

By
June
19
,
1788
,
he
had
presented
himself
to
its
Commander
in
Chief
,
the
Governor
of
the
Southern
Provinces
,
the
Director
of
the
War
College
--
The
Prince
.

Representing
the
Emperor
were
the
Prince
De
Ligne
,
still
as
impetuous
as
a
youth
of
twenty
;
;

From
Milan
came
the
young
Chevalier
De
Litta
,
an
officer
in
the
service
of
Malta
.

At
headquarters
--
sufficiently
far
from
the
firing
line
to
make
you
forget
occasionally
that
you
were
in
a
war
--
Lewis
found
that
the
Commander
in
Chief's
only
desk
was
his
knees
(
and
his
only
comb
,
his
fingers
)
.

In
the
great
one's
personal
quarters
,
a
portable
house
,
almost
every
evening
saw
an
elegant
banquet
or
reception
.

There's
a
man
who
never
goes
by
the
ordinary
road
but
still
arrives
at
his
goal
,
who
gratuitously
gets
himself
into
difficulty
in
order
to
get
out
of
it
with
eclat
,
in
a
word
a
man
who
creates
monsters
for
himself
in
order
to
appear
a
Hercules
in
destroying
them
.

But
Suvorov's
face
was
also
a
theater
of
vivacity
,
and
his
tough
,
stooping
little
frame
was
briskness
embodied
.

When
Littlepage
was
introduced
,
if
the
General
behaved
as
usual
,
the
newcomer
faced
a
staccato
salvo
of
queries
:
origin
?
?

His
breakfast
was
tea
;
;

Underneath
,
he
remained
one
of
the
best-educated
Russians
of
his
day
.

To
Serenissimus
such
tribes
as
the
Cossacks
of
the
Don
or
those
ex-bandits
the
Zaporogian
Cossacks
(
in
whose
islands
along
the
lower
Dnieper
the
Polish
novelist
Sienkiewicz
would
one
day
place
With
Fire
And
Sword
)
were
just
elements
for
enforced
resettlement
in
,
say
,
Bessarabia
,
where
,
as
the
faithful
of
the
Black
Sea
borders
,
he
could
use
their
presence
as
bargaining
points
in
the
Czarina's
territorial
claims
against
Turkey
.

Suvorov
played
parent
not
just
to
his
Cossacks
but
to
all
his
troops
.

These
illiterate
boors
conscripted
from
villages
all
across
the
Czarina's
empire
had
,
Suvorov
may
have
told
Lewis
,
just
two
things
a
commander
could
count
on
:
physical
fitness
and
personal
courage
.

When
their
levies
came
shambling
into
camp
,
they
were
all
elbows
,
hair
,
and
beard
.

Transparent
look
,
waxy
skin
--
could
well
be
uremia
.

We
went
out
of
the
office
and
down
the
hall
to
a
window
where
documents
and
more
officials
awaited
us
,
the
rest
of
the
office
personnel
hot
upon
our
heels
.

The
wear
and
tear
of
life
have
taught
me
that
very
few
friends
of
mutual
friends
long
to
see
foreign
strangers
,
but
I
planned
on
being
the
soul
of
tact
,
of
giving
them
plenty
of
outs
was
there
the
tiniest
implication
that
their
cups
were
already
running
over
without
us
.

My
diplomacy
was
needless
.

Having
completed
our
camera
work
,
we
started
our
climb
.

I
suppose
the
same
emotion
holds
,
if
to
a
lesser
degree
,
with
any
famous
monument
.

We
are
here
!
!

In
1687
the
Turks
,
who
had
been
in
control
of
the
city
since
the
fifteenth
century
,
with
a
truly
shattering
lack
of
prudence
used
the
Parthenon
as
a
powder
magazine
.

It
remained
,
however
,
for
Mando
to
teach
me
that
Doric
symbolized
strength
,
Ionic
wisdom
,
and
Corinthian
beauty
,
the
three
pillars
of
the
ancient
world
.

By
a
combination
of
music
,
lighting
effects
,
and
narration
,
famous
events
that
have
transpired
in
these
locations
are
evoked
and
re-created
for
large
audiences
usually
to
considerable
acclaim
.

The
Acropolis
had
been
scheduled
for
the
treatment
too
,
but
apparently
it
was
to
take
place
at
the
time
of
the
full
moon
when
the
Athenians
themselves
,
out
of
respect
for
the
natural
beauty
of
the
occasion
,
were
wont
to
forgo
their
own
usual
nocturnal
illumination
.

This
was
the
crassest
kind
of
materialism
and
they
,
the
Artists
,
would
have
no
truck
with
it
.

They
close
sometime
after
eight
.

Although
open
to
the
general
public
it
is
not
overcrowded
;
;

This
agreeable
state
of
affairs
is
explicable
,
I
think
,
on
two
counts
.

We
were
struck
by
the
notable
absence
of
banana
skins
and
beer
cans
,
but
just
so
that
we
wouldn't
go
overboard
on
Greek
refinement
,
perfection
was
side-stepped
by
a
couple
of
braying
portable
radios
.

A
good
deal
of
English
was
spoken
on
the
beach
,
most
educated
Greeks
learn
it
in
childhood
,
and
there
were
also
American
wives
and
children
of
our
overseas
servicemen
.

At
Sounion
there
is
a
group
of
beautiful
columns
,
the
ruins
of
a
temple
to
Poseidon
,
of
particular
interest
at
that
time
,
as
active
reconstruction
was
in
progress
.

Gaunt
scaffoldings
adjoined
the
ruins
,
and
on
the
ground
segments
of
columns
two
and
a
half
to
three
feet
in
thickness
were
being
fitted
with
sections
cunningly
chiseled
to
match
exactly
the
fluting
and
proportion
of
the
original
.

This
he
claimed
was
the
favorite
refrain
of
the
English
.

In
proportion
to
the
degradation
of
his
moral
worth
,
is
the
increase
of
his
worth
to
them
.

To
exonerate
the
legislature
and
thereby
extricate
himself
from
a
sticky
situation
,
Pike
took
another
course
and
made
it
appear
that
the
legislature
had
been
bilked
.

The
game
is
not
worth
the
ammunition
it
would
cost
.

The
strategy
worked
perfectly
.

To
Pike
,
silence
was
tantamount
to
an
admission
of
guilt
,
and
he
determined
to
get
Robinson
onto
the
dueling
ground
at
all
costs
.

If
Robinson
was
a
liar
and
a
slanderer
,
he
was
also
a
very
canny
gentleman
,
for
nothing
that
Pike
could
do
would
pry
so
much
as
a
single
word
out
of
him
.

Preoccupied
with
his
own
defense
and
his
attempts
to
get
Robinson
to
fight
,
Pike
lessened
his
attacks
on
Woodruff
,
and
finally
stopped
them
altogether
.

One-armed
,
gruff
,
frugally
honest
,
Governor
Pope
had
been
the
ideal
man
to
assume
office
in
Arkansas
after
the
disgraceful
antics
of
political
bosses
like
Crittenden
,
and
he
ruled
the
state
with
an
iron
fist
,
tolerating
no
nonsense
.

Woodruff
wanted
this
political
windfall
very
badly
,
and
everyone
assumed
that
he
would
get
it
because
he
was
a
close
friend
of
the
governor
and
his
stanchest
supporter
.

We
think
the
governor
treated
us
rather
shabbily
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
.

We
hope
that
he
will
execute
it
in
a
manner
that
will
entitle
him
to
credit
.

As
summer
cooled
into
fall
and
winter
,
even
so
the
relationship
between
the
two
men
continued
to
grow
colder
by
the
day
,
and
by
December
of
1834
it
was
icy
.

And
,
for
the
moment
at
least
,
the
governor
now
found
himself
allied
with
the
head
of
the
Crittenden
faction
he
had
formerly
opposed
,
and
Pike
was
credited
with
a
clear
triumph
over
Woodruff
.

Little
Rock
is
,
without
any
flattery
,
one
of
the
dullest
towns
in
the
United
States
and
I
would
not
have
remained
two
hours
in
the
place
,
if
I
had
not
met
with
some
good
friends
who
made
me
forget
its
dreariness
.

He
again
began
to
play
the
violin
,
and
tucking
the
instrument
beneath
his
chin
,
performed
soulful
and
romantic
airs
to
match
the
expressions
on
the
faces
of
the
lovely
women
who
gathered
to
hear
him
.

Very
soon
after
his
arrival
in
Little
Rock
,
Pike
had
joined
one
of
the
most
influential
organizations
in
town
,
the
Little
Rock
Debating
Society
,
and
it
was
with
this
group
that
he
made
his
debut
as
an
orator
,
being
invited
to
deliver
the
annual
Fourth
of
July
address
the
club
sponsored
every
year
.

Samuel
Gorton
was
born
at
Gorton
,
England
,
near
the
present
city
of
Manchester
,
about
1592
.

Soon
he
was
in
trouble
there
,
for
defending
a
woman
who
was
accused
of
smiling
in
church
.

His
wife
was
in
delicate
health
and
nursing
an
infant
with
measles
.

The
unconquerable
Mrs.
Hutchinson
was
residing
at
Pocasset
,
after
having
been
excommunicated
by
the
Boston
church
and
thrown
out
of
the
colony
.

One
can
imagine
that
with
her
and
Gorton
there
it
was
no
place
for
anyone
with
weak
nerves
.

He
was
jailed
and
banished
.

Gorton
then
moved
to
Providence
and
soon
put
the
town
in
a
turmoil
.

Master
Gorton
,
having
foully
abused
high
and
low
at
Aquidneck
is
now
bewitching
and
bemaddening
poor
Providence
,
both
with
his
unclean
and
foul
censures
of
all
the
ministers
of
this
country
(
for
which
myself
have
in
Christ's
name
withstood
him
)
,
and
also
denying
all
visible
and
external
ordinances
in
depth
of
Familism
:
almost
all
suck
in
his
poison
,
as
at
first
they
did
at
Aquidneck
.

Some
few
and
myself
withstand
his
inhabitation
and
town
privileges
,
without
confession
and
reformation
of
his
uncivil
and
inhuman
practices
at
Portsmouth
;
;

Williams
also
stated
:
Our
peace
was
like
the
peace
of
a
man
who
hath
the
tertian
ague
.

Up
to
now
,
Gorton
had
been
looking
for
trouble
,
and
now
that
he
was
trying
to
get
away
from
it
,
trouble
started
looking
for
him
.

Gorton
and
company
,
however
,
promptly
bought
land
from
Miantonomi
a
few
miles
south
of
Pawtuxet
,
extending
from
the
present
Gaspee
Point
south
to
Warwick
Neck
and
twenty
miles
inland
.

The
settlement
was
called
Shawomet
.

Following
the
glorious
lead
of
the
heroes
of
Pawtuxet
,
they
also
submitted
themselves
to
the
protection
of
Massachusetts
.

However
,
the
General
Court
at
Boston
ordered
the
purchasers
of
Shawomet
to
appear
before
them
to
answer
the
sachems'
claim
.

The
purchasers
rejected
the
order
in
two
letters
written
in
vigorous
terms
.

It
pointed
out
twenty-six
instances
of
blasphemy
in
the
letters
,
and
ordered
the
writers
to
submit
or
force
of
arms
would
be
used
.

The
Commissioners
at
Boston
wrote
the
victims
to
see
their
misdeeds
and
repent
or
they
should
look
upon
them
as
men
prepared
for
slaughter
.

Here
was
Gorton's
chance
to
indulge
in
something
at
which
he
was
supreme
.

When
Fred
wheeled
him
back
into
his
room
,
the
big
one
looking
out
on
the
back
porch
,
and
put
him
to
bed
,
Papa
told
him
he
was
very
tired
but
that
he
had
enjoyed
greatly
the
trip
downtown
.

I've
been
cooped
up
so
long
,
he
added
.

That
night
after
supper
I
went
back
over
to
48
Spruce
Street
--
Ralph
and
I
at
that
time
were
living
at
168
Chestnut
--
and
Ralph
went
with
me
.

Baby
,
I
saw
a
lot
of
old
friends
I
hadn't
seen
in
a
long
time
,
he
told
me
,
his
eyes
bright
.

The
hemorrhage
was
in
the
prostate
region
;
;

The
doctor
agreed
,
but
explained
that
it
would
be
necessary
first
to
check
Fred's
blood
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
it
was
of
the
same
type
as
Papa's
.

To
give
a
patient
the
wrong
type
of
blood
,
said
the
doctor
,
would
likely
kill
him
.

But
we
aren't
going
to
let
you
give
him
any
.

Because
,
Fred
,
it
could
do
him
no
good
.

Papa
had
left
us
about
the
same
hour
of
the
night
that
Ben
had
passed
on
.

W.
O.
Wolfe
,
prominent
business
man
and
pioneer
resident
of
this
section
,
died
shortly
after
midnight
Tuesday
at
his
home
48
Spruce
Street
,
the
Asheville
Times
of
Wednesday
,
June
21
,
announced
.

The
burial
was
out
in
Riverside
Cemetery
.

After
they
had
paid
all
his
debts
and
the
funeral
costs
,
Ralph
and
Fred
had
some
fourteen
thousand
dollars
,
as
I
remember
,
with
which
to
pay
the
bequests
.

This
,
manifestly
,
would
not
provide
$5000
to
each
of
the
surviving
five
children
.

he
was
given
the
difference
between
that
amount
and
$5000
.

Tom
had
received
four
years
of
education
at
the
University
of
North
Carolina
and
two
at
Harvard
,
and
Fred
had
been
in
and
out
of
Georgia
Tech
and
Carneigie
Tech
and
part
of
the
time
had
been
a
self-help
student
.

And
that's
how
Papa's
estate
was
divided
.

And
he
didn't
,
by
a
long
shot
!
!

Actually
Tom
had
been
postponing
giving
them
an
answer
,
I
am
confident
,
because
he
did
not
want
to
go
out
there
to
teach
.

But
things
were
worked
out
in
the
family
and
late
in
August
he
wrote
Miss
McCrady
an
explanatory
letter
in
which
he
told
her
that
matters
at
home
had
been
in
an
unsettled
condition
after
Papa's
death
and
he
had
not
known
whether
he
would
stay
at
home
with
Mama
,
accept
the
Northwestern
job
,
or
return
to
Harvard
.

That
third
year
he
wrote
plays
with
a
fury
.

In
this
play
there
were
some
thirty
or
more
named
characters
and
I
don't
know
how
many
more
unnamed
.

In
describing
it
to
Professor
Baker
after
it
had
been
chosen
for
production
,
he
defended
his
great
array
of
characters
by
declaring
that
he
had
included
that
many
not
because
I
didn't
know
how
to
save
paint
,
but
because
the
play
required
them
.

He
said
he
would
do
it
,
though
probably
nobody
would
produce
it
,
for
his
own
soul's
ease
and
comfort
.

it
was
visiting
University
of
North
Carolina
alumni
in
New
York
to
ask
them
for
contributions
to
the
Graham
Memorial
Building
fund
.

The
Graham
Memorial
would
be
the
campus
student
union
honoring
the
late
and
much
beloved
Edward
Kidder
Graham
,
who
had
been
president
when
Tom
entered
the
university
.

Tom
said
he
almost
burst
into
tears
,
he
was
so
disappointed
and
put
out
.

This
group
in
Park
Place
Church
was
made
up
of
the
earnest
few
.

I
engaged
more
and
more
in
religious
activities
.

Besides
Church
and
Sunday
School
I
went
to
out-of-door
meetings
on
the
sidewalk
at
the
church
door
.

I
went
to
an
afternoon
service
at
the
Aj
.

Meanwhile
I
myself
was
not
yet
saved
.

No
load
of
sin
had
been
laid
on
my
shoulders
,
nor
did
earnest
effort
enable
me
to
become
conscious
of
one
.

There
is
,
of
course
,
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
,
which
asserts
that
each
of
us
as
individuals
partakes
of
the
guilt
of
our
first
ancestor
.

and
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
is
compounded
of
injustice
.

From
that
time
to
this
my
religious
concern
is
that
I
might
give
effective
help
to
the
bringing
in
of
God's
kingdom
on
earth
.

As
we
observe
moral
law
and
physical
law
they
appear
as
being
inevitable
.

We
can
conceive
of
no
alternatives
.

Deity
and
Law
are
one
and
inseparable
.

With
this
conviction
,
the
partition
between
the
sacred
and
the
secular
disappears
.

One
serves
society
by
conducting
a
business
from
which
a
certain
number
of
employees
draw
their
means
of
subsistence
;
;

Each
will
decide
on
his
own
course
somewhere
between
these
two
extreme
cases
according
to
the
sense
of
responsibility
which
is
determined
for
him
by
the
particular
circumstances
of
his
own
life
.

For
this
decision
a
man
must
take
personal
responsibility
.

Says
he
,
I
may
never
imagine
that
in
the
struggle
between
personal
and
supra-personal
responsibility
it
is
possible
to
make
a
compromise
between
the
ethical
and
the
purposive
in
the
shape
of
a
relative
ethic
;
;

On
the
contrary
it
is
my
duty
to
make
my
own
decision
as
between
the
two
.

This
truth
that
the
moral
law
is
natural
has
other
important
corollaries
.

It
is
puzzling
to
the
occidental
mind
(
to
mine
at
least
)
to
assign
sacredness
to
animal
,
insect
,
and
plant
life
.

There
is
indeed
a
moral
responsibility
on
man
himself
,
for
his
own
soul's
sake
,
to
respect
lower
life
and
to
avoid
the
infliction
of
suffering
,
but
this
viewpoint
Schweitzer
rejects
.

Persons
,
whether
white
,
black
,
brown
or
yellow
,
are
a
concern
of
God
.

Such
is
the
field
for
exercising
our
reverence
.

This
intellectual
approach
to
spiritual
life
suited
me
well
,
because
I
was
never
content
to
lead
a
divided
life
.

As
I
have
said
,
words
from
Tennyson
remain
ever
in
my
memory
:
That
mind
and
soul
,
according
well
,
May
make
one
music
as
before
.

I
asked
one
day
what
he
was
doing
.

None
of
these
discoveries
were
neatly
rounded
off
bits
of
knowledge
.

It
is
as
if
we
,
in
our
center
of
human
observation
,
from
time
to
time
penetrate
more
deeply
into
the
unknown
.

Such
a
list
must
naturally
be
selective
,
and
the
treatment
of
each
man
is
brief
,
for
I
am
interested
only
in
their
general
ideas
on
the
moral
measure
of
literature
.

Altogether
,
the
list
will
give
us
considerable
variety
in
attitudes
and
some
typical
ones
,
for
these
critics
range
all
the
way
from
censors
to
those
who
consider
art
above
ethics
,
all
the
way
from
Plato
to
Poe
.

In
short
,
he
is
constantly
concerned
with
the
ethical
effects
.

When
he
turns
briefly
to
literary
style
,
in
the
Third
Book
,
he
again
looks
to
the
effect
on
the
audience
.

Plato
is
,
at
times
,
just
as
suspicious
of
the
poets
themselves
as
he
is
of
their
work
.

When
he
discusses
tyrants
in
the
Eighth
Book
of
The
Republic
,
he
pictures
the
poets
as
willing
to
praise
the
worst
rulers
.

And
with
this
point
about
the
passions
,
we
encounter
Plato's
dualism
.

His
whole
objection
,
indeed
,
seems
to
rise
out
of
a
deep
conviction
that
the
poets
do
have
great
power
to
influence
,
but
Plato
seldom
pays
any
attention
to
what
might
be
called
the
poem
itself
.

He
even
calls
upon
the
poets
to
defend
the
Muse
and
to
show
that
poetry
may
contribute
to
virtue
.

He
says
:

We
may
further
grant
to
those
of
her
(
Poetry's
)
defenders
who
are
lovers
of
poetry
and
yet
not
poets
,
the
permission
to
speak
in
prose
on
her
behalf
:
let
them
show
not
only
that
she
is
pleasant
but
also
useful
to
States
and
to
human
life
,
and
we
will
listen
in
a
kindly
spirit
;
;

In
Aristotle's
analysis
of
tragedy
in
the
Poetics
,
we
find
an
attempt
to
isolate
the
art
,
to
consider
only
those
things
proper
to
it
,
to
discover
how
it
differs
from
other
arts
,
and
to
deal
with
the
effects
peculiar
to
it
.

He
assures
us
,
early
in
the
Poetics
,
that
all
art
is
imitation
and
that
all
imitation
gives
pleasure
,
but
he
distinguishes
between
art
in
general
and
poetic
art
on
the
basis
of
the
means
,
manner
,
and
the
objects
of
the
imitation
.

In
his
study
Samuel
Johnson
,
Joseph
Wood
Krutch
takes
this
line
when
he
says
that
what
Aristotle
really
means
by
his
theory
of
catharsis
is
that
our
evil
passions
may
be
so
purged
by
the
dramatic
ritual
that
it
is
less
likely
that
we
shall
indulge
them
through
our
own
acts
.

In
Krutch's
view
,
this
is
one
way
to
show
how
literature
may
be
moral
in
effect
without
employing
the
explicit
methods
of
a
moralist
.

Or
in
more
Freudian
terms
,
the
experience
may
serve
to
sublimate
our
destructive
urges
and
strengthen
the
ego
and
superego
.

The
second
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
England
was
the
setting
for
a
violent
and
long
controversy
over
the
moral
quality
of
renaissance
literature
,
especially
the
drama
.

Both
sides
agreed
that
the
theater
must
stand
a
moral
test
,
but
they
could
not
agree
on
whether
the
poets
were
a
good
or
a
bad
influence
.

With
that
act
of
Parliament
the
opponents
of
the
stage
won
the
day
,
and
for
more
than
two
decades
after
that
England
had
no
legitimate
public
drama
.

But
his
opposition
hardened
and
by
1579
,
in
The
School
Of
Abuse
,
he
was
ready
to
banish
all
players
.

He
advises
women
to
beware
of
those
places
which
in
sorrows
cheere
you
and
beguile
you
in
mirth
.

He
warns
that
a
single
glance
can
lead
us
into
temptation
,
for
Looking
eies
have
lyking
hartes
,
and
lyking
hartes
may
burne
in
lust
.

But
it
would
not
be
very
satisfactory
to
leave
our
conclusions
at
the
point
just
reached
.

Other
conceivable
goals
,
such
as
character-education
and
social
adjustment
,
are
of
secondary
importance
to
them
.

The
ideal
of
a
liberal
education
impresses
itself
upon
the
students
more
and
more
as
they
move
through
college
.

In
the
university
milieu
of
scholarship
and
research
,
of
social
diversity
,
of
new
ideas
and
varied
and
wide-ranging
interests
,
socialization
into
a
campus
culture
apparently
means
heightened
appreciation
of
the
idea
of
a
liberal
education
in
the
arts
and
sciences
.

The
purely
cognitive
or
informational
problems
are
often
acute
.

The
old
ideal
of
the
independent
entrepreneur
is
extant
--
but
so
is
the
recognition
that
the
main
chance
may
be
in
a
corporate
bureaucracy
.

In
their
views
on
dating
,
courtship
,
sex
,
and
family
life
,
our
students
prefer
what
they
are
expected
to
prefer
.

For
them
,
in
the
grim
words
of
a
once-popular
song
,
love
and
marriage
go
together
like
a
horse
and
carriage
.

And
as
they
go
through
college
,
the
students
tend
to
bring
their
political
position
in
line
with
that
prevalent
in
the
social
groups
to
which
they
belong
.

Furthermore
,
in
certain
respects
,
there
are
norms
common
to
colleges
and
universities
across
the
country
.

For
instance
,
college-educated
people
consistently
show
up
in
study
after
study
as
more
often
than
others
supporters
of
the
Bill
of
Rights
and
other
democratic
rights
and
liberties
.

Although
we
have
no
measures
of
its
strength
or
intensity
,
the
heritage
of
the
doctrine
of
inalienable
rights
is
retained
.

Few
students
are
really
so
faceless
in
the
not-so-lonely
crowd
of
the
swelling
population
in
our
institutions
of
higher
learning
.

These
personal
and
social
goals
often
overshadow
the
goals
of
intellectual
clarity
,
and
spiritual
transcendence
.

The
cult
of
adjustment
does
exist
.

Upon
second
thought
we
were
forced
to
realize
that
we
have
very
few
reliable
historical
benchmarks
against
which
we
might
compare
the
present
situation
,
and
that
conclusions
that
present-day
students
are
more
or
less
religious
could
not
be
defended
on
the
basis
of
our
data
.

Even
on
his
tough
constitution
,
the
exposure
and
strenuous
activity
were
beginning
to
tell
in
earnest
.

Morgan
was
ordered
to
attack
the
enemy
,
who
had
meantime
moved
to
Edge
Hill
on
the
left
of
the
Americans
.

A
body
of
redcoats
were
seen
marching
down
a
nearby
slope
,
a
tempting
target
for
the
riflemen
,
who
threw
a
volley
into
their
ranks
and
messed
up
the
smart
formation
considerably
.

The
British
,
although
suffering
considerable
losses
,
noted
the
defection
of
the
Marylanders
,
made
a
stand
,
then
turned
and
attacked
Morgan
who
became
greatly
outnumbered
and
had
to
retire
.

For
example
,
he
captured
some
persons
from
York
County
,
who
with
teams
were
taking
to
Philadelphia
the
furniture
of
a
man
who
had
just
been
released
from
prison
through
the
efforts
of
his
wife
,
and
who
apparently
was
helpless
to
prevent
the
theft
of
his
household
goods
.

Morgan
complained
to
Washington
about
the
men
detailed
to
him
for
scouting
duty
,
most
of
them
he
said
being
useless
.

They
straggle
at
such
a
rate
,
he
told
the
commander-in-chief
,
that
if
the
enemy
were
enterprising
,
they
might
get
two
from
us
,
when
we
would
take
one
of
them
,
which
makes
me
wish
General
Howe
would
go
on
,
lest
any
incident
happen
to
us
.

Daniel
Morgan's
rheumatic
condition
worsened
with
the
increase
of
the
cold
and
damp
weather
.

It
is
doubtful
if
Morgan
was
able
to
take
home
much
money
to
his
wife
and
children
,
for
his
pay
,
as
shown
by
the
War
Department
Abstracts
of
early
1778
was
$75
a
month
as
a
colonel
,
and
that
apt
to
be
delayed
.

He
was
shown
a
warm
welcome
regardless
,
and
spent
the
time
in
Winchester
recuperating
from
his
ailment
,
enjoying
his
family
and
arranging
his
private
affairs
which
were
,
of
course
,
run
down
.

There
must
have
been
special
feelings
of
joy
and
patriotism
in
the
heart
of
Daniel
Morgan
too
,
when
the
news
was
received
on
April
30th
of
the
recognition
by
France
of
the
independence
of
the
United
States
.

The
dreary
camp
at
Valley
Forge
was
turned
into
an
arena
of
rejoicing
.

His
soldiers
on
the
whole
did
not
celebrate
so
mildly
.

The
reason
for
this
,
the
orders
said
,
is
that
the
enemy
may
think
to
take
advantage
of
the
celebration
of
this
day
.

The
Frenchman
had
been
ordered
to
approach
the
enemy's
lines
,
harass
them
and
get
intelligence
of
their
movements
.

Ford
urged
Morgan
to
capture
these
men
,
who
,
he
thought
,
might
be
disguised
as
Quakers
or
peasants
.

A
letter
of
a
few
days
later
from
Washington's
aide
to
Morgan
stated
,
His
Excellency
is
highly
pleased
with
your
conduct
upon
this
occasion
.

Even
so
,
Edward's
ambassadors
can
scarcely
have
foreseen
that
five
years
of
unremitting
work
lay
ahead
of
them
before
peace
was
finally
made
and
that
when
it
did
come
the
countless
embassies
that
left
England
for
Rome
during
that
period
had
very
little
to
do
with
it
.

Nogaret
is
hardly
an
impartial
witness
,
and
even
he
did
not
make
his
charges
against
Boniface
until
the
latter
was
dead
,
but
there
is
some
truth
in
what
he
said
and
more
in
what
he
did
not
say
.

Because
of
these
involvements
in
the
matter
at
stake
,
Boniface
lacked
the
impartiality
that
is
supposed
to
be
an
essential
qualification
for
the
position
of
arbiter
,
and
in
retrospect
that
would
seem
to
be
sufficient
reason
why
the
English
embassies
to
the
Curia
proved
so
fruitless
.

He
was
a
learned
and
brilliant
man
,
one
of
the
best
jurists
in
Europe
and
with
flashes
of
penetrating
insight
,
and
yet
in
his
dealings
with
other
people
,
particularly
when
he
tried
to
be
ingratiating
,
he
was
capable
of
an
abysmal
stupidity
that
can
have
come
only
from
a
complete
incomprehension
of
human
nature
and
human
motives
.

Boniface
was
later
to
explain
to
the
English
that
Robert
of
Burgundy
and
Guy
De
St.-Pol
were
easy
enough
to
do
business
with
;
;

To
the
pope
,
head
of
the
universal
Church
,
to
the
duke
of
Burgundy
,
taking
full
advantage
of
his
position
on
the
borders
of
France
and
of
the
Empire
,
or
to
Othon
,
who
found
it
quite
natural
that
he
should
do
homage
to
Edward
for
Tipperary
and
to
the
count
of
Savoy
for
Grandson
,
Flotte's
outspoken
nationalism
was
completely
incomprehensible
.

when
the
pope
,
trying
no
doubt
to
appeal
to
his
better
nature
,
said
to
him
,
You
have
already
taken
Normandy
.

He
was
unable
to
send
any
more
help
to
his
allies
on
the
Continent
,
and
during
the
next
few
years
many
of
them
,
left
to
resist
French
pressure
unaided
,
surrendered
to
the
inevitable
and
made
their
peace
with
Philip
.

These
shifts
in
alliance
and
allegiance
not
only
increased
the
difficulties
confronting
the
English
embassy
as
a
whole
,
but
also
directly
involved
the
two
Savoyards
,
Amadee
and
Othon
.

A
second
truce
had
been
arbitrated
in
April
,
1298
,
by
Jean
D'Arlay
,
lord
of
Chalon-sur-Saone
,
the
most
staunch
of
Edward's
Burgundian
allies
,
and
these
last
were
represented
in
the
discussions
at
the
Curia
by
Gautier
de
Montfaucon
,
Othon's
neighbor
and
a
member
of
the
Vaudois
coalition
.

Alfred
wanted
to
invest
in
my
father's
hotel
and
advance
enough
money
to
build
a
larger
place
.

It
was
a
very
tempting
offer
.

They
had
my
mother's
opinion
of
him
:
that
he
was
too
sharp
or
a
little
too
good
to
be
true
.

From
that
day
on
he
never
spoke
to
Harry
or
to
Lew
,
or
to
Lew's
two
boys
,
Mort
and
Jimmy
.

Spring
was
life
--
and
Alfred
Alpert
in
his
sickroom
was
death
.

Alfred
knew
that
,
too
.

One
day
Alfred
told
him
that
he
had
decided
to
leave
everything
to
me
.

My
father
,
a
wise
man
,
asked
him
not
to
.

He
didn't
want
Alfred
to
leave
me
trouble
because
that's
all
it
would
be
,
and
Alfred
understood
.

The
doctor
wanted
him
in
a
hospital
;
;

The
day
Alfred
left
his
home
and
Fleischmanns
he
gave
up
the
convictions
of
a
lifetime
.

For
a
few
minutes
there
was
nothing
to
hear
.

There
was
a
finality
in
the
rhythm
of
the
prayer
--
it
was
the
end
of
a
life
,
the
end
of
hope
,
and
the
wondering
if
there
would
ever
be
another
beginning
.

Meltzer
stayed
with
Alfred
,
and
when
the
door
opened
they
both
came
out
.

The
car
was
waiting
for
him
.

Speak
to
me
.

So
Meltzer
learned
a
new
trade
from
Banks
,
who
supplied
the
town
and
the
hotels
with
meat
.

Banks
had
a
family
--
a
wife
,
a
daughter
,
and
a
son
.

The
daughter
,
Lilly
,
was
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
and
I
always
had
hopes
that
someday
she
and
Meltzer
would
find
each
other
.

He
treated
both
with
equal
indifference
and
with
equal
contempt
;
;

Her
brother
Karl
was
a
very
gentle
soul
,
her
mother
was
a
quiet
woman
who
said
little
but
who
had
hard
,
probing
eyes
.

The
road
past
the
butcher
shop
took
us
along
the
side
of
a
stream
.

Lilly
preferred
the
loneliness
of
that
walk
.

It
wasn't
hard
to
understand
.

The
song
,
he
said
,
was
called
The
Stream's
Lullaby
,
and
when
he
sang
,
Gute
ruh
,
Gute
ruh
,
Mach't
die
augen
zu
,
there
was
such
longing
and
such
simple
sadness
that
it
frightened
me
.

I
felt
very
flattered
to
be
included
in
the
protection
of
their
company
even
though
I
had
nothing
to
be
protected
from
.

In
sum
,
it
can
be
said
that
the
techniques
and
standards
of
present
day
have
their
origin
at
the
turn
of
the
century
.

Almost
inevitably
,
the
first
result
of
this
technological
revolution
was
a
reaction
against
the
methods
and
in
many
cases
the
conclusions
of
the
Oxford
school
of
Stubbs
,
Freeman
and
(
particularly
)
Green
regarding
the
nature
of
the
Anglo-Saxon
conquest
of
Britain
.

Although
one
meets
with
occasional
extremists
like
Zachrisson
or
,
very
recently
,
Arthur
Wade-Evans
the
majority
of
scholars
have
taken
a
middle
position
between
the
extremes
of
scepticism
and
gullibility
.

Most
now
admit
that
Bede
,
Gildas
,
Nennius
and
The
Anglo-Saxon
Chronicles
cannot
be
the
infallible
guides
to
early
English
history
that
Guest
,
Freeman
and
Green
thought
them
to
be
.

As
R.H.
Hodgkin
has
remarked
:
The
critical
methods
of
the
nineteenth
century
shattered
most
of
this
picturesque
narrative
.

Most
scholars
,
while
willing
to
accept
a
survival
(
revival
?
?

They
,
in
effect
,
have
compromised
the
opposing
positions
of
the
nineteenth
century
.

On
the
other
side
are
the
Celtic
survivalists
who
have
taken
a
tack
divergent
from
both
these
schools
of
nineteenth
century
thought
.

Those
who
do
have
occasion
to
deal
with
the
invasions
in
a
more
general
way
,
like
T.W.
Shore
and
Arthur
Wade-Evans
,
are
on
the
side
of
a
gradual
and
often
peaceful
Germanic
penetration
into
Britain
.

Wade-Evans
,
in
fact
,
denies
that
there
were
any
Anglo-Saxon
invasions
at
all
other
than
a
minor
Jutish
foray
in
A.D.
514
.

Again
omitting
recent
developments
,
E.T.
Leeds'
dictum
of
1913
has
stood
unchallenged
:
So
far
as
archaeology
is
concerned
,
there
is
not
the
least
warrant
for
the
second
(
shore
occupied
by
)
of
these
theories
.

Even
earlier
Haverfield
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
.

In
recent
years
,
however
,
a
wind
of
change
seems
to
be
blowing
through
early
English
historical
circles
.

Where
there
were
none
fifteen
years
ago
,
several
scholars
currently
are
edging
their
way
cautiously
towards
the
acceptance
of
the
shore
occupied
by
position
.

We
must
,
therefore
,
have
a
look
at
the
new
archaeological
material
and
re-examine
the
literary
and
place-name
evidence
which
bears
upon
the
problem
.

in
other
words
its
existence
belongs
to
the
period
of
Roman
Britain
.

This
,
naturally
,
will
be
difficult
to
do
since
both
the
archaeological
and
place-name
evidence
in
this
period
,
with
some
fortunate
exceptions
,
is
insufficient
for
precise
chronological
purposes
.

To
do
so
,
something
was
necessary
beyond
volunteering
because
there
was
little
glamour
or
romance
in
the
European
war
;
;

Baker
gave
Leonard
Wood
credit
for
the
initiation
of
the
draft
of
soldiers
;
;

The
result
was
that
by
secret
agreement
draft
machinery
was
actually
ready
long
before
the
country
knew
that
the
device
was
to
take
the
place
of
the
volunteering
method
which
Theodore
Roosevelt
favored
.

It
was
Baker
,
working
through
Provost
Marshal
Enoch
Crowder
and
Major
Hugh
S.
(
Old
Ironpants
)
Johnson
,
who
arranged
for
a
secret
printing
by
the
million
of
selective
service
blanks
--
again
before
the
Act
was
passed
--
until
corridors
in
the
Government
Printing
Office
were
full
and
the
basement
of
the
Washington
Post
Office
was
stacked
to
the
ceiling
.

it
was
Baker
who
thought
of
lessening
the
shock
,
which
conscription
always
brings
to
a
country
,
by
substituting
Greetings
from
your
neighbors
for
the
recruiting
sergeant
,
and
registration
in
familiar
voting
places
rather
than
at
military
installations
.

Democratic
Floor
Leader
Claude
Kitchin
would
have
no
part
of
the
measure
.

In
the
judgment
of
Chief
of
Staff
Scott
it
was
ironic
that
the
draft
policy
of
a
Democratic
President
,
aimed
at
Germany
,
had
to
be
pushed
through
the
House
of
Representatives
by
the
ranking
minority
member
of
the
Military
Affairs
Committee
--
a
Republican
Jew
born
in
Germany
!
!

After
Kahn's
death
in
1924
Scott
wrote
:
May
he
rest
in
peace
with
the
eternal
gratitude
of
his
adopted
country
.

The
day
passed
without
incident
in
spite
of
the
warning
of
Senator
James
A.
Reed
of
Missouri
:
Baker
,
you
will
have
the
streets
of
our
American
cities
running
with
blood
on
registration
day
.

He
was
the
first
of
2,800,000
called
to
the
Army
through
the
selective
service
system
.

It
was
one
thing
to
call
men
to
the
colors
;
;

In
a
matter
of
months
the
War
Department
built
thirty-two
camps
,
each
one
accommodating
fifty
thousand
men
--
sixteen
were
under
canvas
in
the
South
and
sixteen
with
frame
structures
in
the
North
.

It
was
a
gargantuan
task
;
;

The
total
operation
was
a
construction
project
comparable
in
magnitude
with
the
Panama
Canal
,
but
in
1917
time
was
in
short
supply
;
;

The
world-wide
total
of
deaths
from
Spanish
flu
was
around
twenty
million
;
;

In
mid-September
1918
,
the
influenza-pneumonia
pandemic
swept
through
every
American
military
camp
;
;

Their
policy
ran
counter
to
the
traditional
idea
that
a
good
fighter
was
usually
a
libertine
,
and
that
in
sex
affairs
God-given
passion
was
a
proof
of
manliness
.

His
assignment
was
not
a
new
one
because
Baker
had
sent
him
to
the
Mexican
border
in
1916
to
investigate
lurid
newspaper
stories
about
lack
of
discipline
,
drunkenness
,
and
venereal
disease
in
American
military
camps
.

Ultimately
Fosdick's
Fit
to
fight
slogan
swept
across
the
country
and
every
well-known
red-light
district
in
the
United
States
was
closed
,
a
hundred
and
ten
of
them
.

He
was
placed
in
charge
of
athletics
,
and
among
other
things
adapted
the
type
of
calisthenics
known
as
the
daily
dozen
.

The
CTCA
distributed
a
khaki-bound
songbook
that
provided
the
impetus
for
spirited
renditions
of
the
selections
found
therein
,
plus
a
number
of
others
whose
lyrics
were
more
earthy
--
from
Johnny
Get
Your
Gun
to
Keep
The
Home
Fires
Burning
to
Mademoiselle
From
Armentieres
.

But
we
abide
by
their
insight
.

The
intimations
of
a
related
spirit
and
ordering
of
human
values
are
stronger
than
any
sense
of
disparity
.

We
see
at
once
what
Victor
Hugo
means
when
he
calls
Macbeth
a
northern
scion
of
the
house
of
Atreus
.

Oedipus
and
Lear
attain
similar
insights
by
virtue
of
similar
blindness
.

The
image
of
man
which
enters
into
force
with
Aeschylus
is
still
vital
in
Phedre
and
Athalie
.

It
is
the
triumph
of
rationalism
and
secular
metaphysics
which
marks
the
point
of
no
return
.

We
cannot
conceive
of
Oedipus
without
a
Sphinx
,
nor
of
Hamlet
without
a
Ghost
.

Those
who
walk
on
it
may
encounter
at
any
turn
ministers
of
grace
or
damnation
.

The
same
metaphors
of
swift
ascent
and
calamitous
decline
apply
to
Oedipus
and
Macbeth
because
they
applied
also
to
Alcibiades
and
Essex
.

I
have
said
before
how
difficult
it
is
to
make
any
precise
statements
with
regard
to
the
character
of
the
Greek
and
Elizabethan
public
.

And
in
these
organizations
certain
primal
notions
played
a
radiant
part
,
radiant
both
in
the
sense
of
giving
light
and
of
being
a
pole
toward
which
all
perspectives
converge
.

They
are
the
essential
force
behind
the
conventions
of
tragedy
.

From
this
action
sprang
the
idea
of
somehow
uniting
Greek
and
Shakespearean
drama
into
a
new
total
form
,
capable
of
restoring
to
life
the
ancient
moral
and
poetic
responses
.

The
Bishop
of
Gloucester
described
the
elder
Thomas
in
1577
as
the
richest
recusant
in
his
diocese
,
worth
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
in
lands
and
goods
.

His
daughter
Elinor
married
Quiney's
son
Adrian
in
1613
,
and
his
son
Henry
married
Mary
Lane
of
Stratford
in
1609
.

Bridges
,
a
son
by
his
second
wife
,
was
christened
at
Pebworth
in
1607
,
but
Thomas
the
younger
was
living
at
Packwood
two
years
later
and
sold
Broad
Marston
manor
in
1622
.

Edward
Greville
,
born
about
1565
,
had
inherited
Milcote
on
the
execution
of
his
father
Lodowick
for
murder
in
1589
.

The
corporation
entertained
him
for
dinner
at
Quiney's
house
in
,
with
wine
and
sugar
sent
by
the
bailiff
,
Sturley
.

At
Milcote
on
November
3
,
1597
,
the
aldermen
asked
him
to
support
their
petition
for
a
new
charter
.

Greville
proposed
Quiney
as
the
fittest
man
for
the
following
of
the
cause
and
to
attend
him
in
the
matter
,
and
at
his
suggestion
the
corporation
allowed
Quiney
two
shillings
a
day
.

Sturley
quoted
Quiney
as
having
written
on
November
1
that
if
he
had
more
monei
presente
much
might
be
done
to
obtaine
our
Charter
enlargd
,
ij
faires
more
,
with
tole
of
corne
,
bestes
,
and
sheepe
,
and
a
matter
of
more
valewe
then
all
that
.

Sturley
thought
that
this
matter
might
be
the
rest
of
the
tithes
and
the
College
houses
and
landes
in
our
towne
.

Daniel
Baker
deluged
his
Unckle
Quyne
with
requests
to
pay
money
for
him
to
drapers
in
Watling
Street
and
at
the
Two
Cats
in
Canning
Street
.

Baker
wrote
:
I
tooke
order
with
Sr.
E.
Grevile
for
the
payment
of
Ceartaine
monei
beefore
his
going
towardes
London
.

He
asked
Quiney
to
find
out
whether
the
money
had
been
paid
and
,
if
not
,
to
send
to
the
lodging
of
Sir
Edward
and
entreat
him
to
pay
what
he
owed
.

The
chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
wrote
on
the
petition
:
in
myn
opinion
it
is
very
resonable
and
conscionable
for
hir
maiestie
to
graunt
in
relief
of
this
towne
twise
afflicted
and
almost
wasted
by
fire
.

my
mare
at
coming
up
14
days
;
;

Here
was
another
indispensable
tool
.

The
failure
of
Greece
to
reach
the
imperial
destiny
that
Periclean
Athens
had
seemed
to
promise
was
almost
directly
attributable
to
her
physical
conformation
.

A
credulousness
,
a
distaste
for
documentation
,
an
uncritical
reliance
on
contemporary
accounts
,
and
a
proneness
to
assume
a
theory
as
true
before
adequate
proof
was
provided
were
all
evidences
of
his
failure
to
comprehend
the
use
of
the
scientific
method
or
to
evaluate
the
responsibilities
of
the
historian
to
his
reading
public
.

His
credulity
is
perhaps
best
illustrated
in
his
introduction
to
The
Emancipation
Of
Massachusetts
,
which
purports
to
examine
the
trials
of
Moses
and
to
draw
a
parallel
between
the
leader
of
the
Israelite
exodus
from
Egypt
and
the
leadership
of
the
Puritan
clergy
in
colonial
New
England
.

The
desire
to
substantiate
a
thesis
at
the
expense
of
sound
research
technique
smacks
more
of
the
propagandist
than
the
historian
.

If
he
found
data
that
fitted
his
general
plan
,
he
used
it
and
counted
his
sources
trustworthy
.

Such
manipulations
are
frequently
encountered
in
his
essay
on
the
suppression
of
the
monasteries
during
the
English
reformation
.

In
summary
,
Brooks
Adams
felt
that
the
nature
of
history
was
order
and
that
the
order
so
discovered
was
as
much
subject
to
historical
laws
as
the
forces
of
nature
.

In
the
final
analysis
his
contribution
to
American
historiography
was
founded
on
almost
intuitive
insights
into
religion
,
economics
,
and
Darwinism
,
the
three
factors
which
conditioned
his
search
for
a
law
of
history
.

Brooks
Adams
considered
religion
as
an
extremely
significant
manifestation
of
man's
fear
of
the
unknown
.

But
it
was
nothing
more
than
that
.

The
German
barbarians
of
the
fourth
century
offered
an
excellent
example
:

it
was
also
sacred
,
and
no
believer
in
an
inspired
church
could
tolerate
having
her
canons
examined
as
we
should
examine
human
laws
.

To
Adams
that
age
in
which
religion
exercised
power
over
the
entire
culture
of
the
race
was
one
of
imagination
,
and
it
is
largely
the
admiration
he
so
obviously
held
for
such
eras
that
betrays
a
peculiar
religiosity
--
a
sentiment
he
would
have
probably
denied
.

I
had
had
my
name
taken
out
of
the
telephone
book
,
and
this
was
partly
because
of
a
convict
who
had
been
discharged
from
Sing
Sing
and
who
called
me
night
after
night
.

He
was
a
captain
,
he
said
,
in
the
army
,
and
on
the
train
to
New
York
his
purse
and
all
his
money
had
been
stolen
,
and
would
I
lend
him
twenty-five
dollars
to
be
given
him
at
the
General
Delivery
window
?
?

We
found
that
a
charitable
society
in
New
York
had
a
long
case-history
of
the
two
;
;

I
had
always
thought
of
that
lovable
man
as
many
years
older
than
myself
,
although
he
was
perhaps
only
twenty
years
older
,
and
he
confirmed
my
feeling
,
along
with
the
feeling
of
both
my
sons
,
that
teachers
of
the
classics
are
invariably
endearing
.

There
had
been
reading
at
table
,
especially
from
two
books
,
Pope
Gregory
The
Great's
account
of
St.
Scholastica
in
his
Dialogues
and
my
own
The
World
Of
Washington
Irving
.

Two
or
three
times
,
C.
C.
Burlingham
came
to
lunch
with
us
in
Weston
,
that
wonderful
man
who
lived
to
be
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
and
whose
birthplace
had
been
my
Wall
Street
suburb
.

He
replied
,
My
first
choice
would
be
Mark
Howe
.

Finally
,
colleges
and
clubs
took
the
line
that
speakers
from
England
were
not
wanted
any
longer
,
even
speakers
like
S.K.
,
so
unlike
the
novelists
and
poets
who
had
patronized
the
Americans
for
many
years
.

With
their
facile
generalizations
about
the
United
States
,
these
mediocrities
,
as
they
often
were
,
had
been
great
successes
.

He
was
convinced
that
George
Orwell's
1984
was
nearly
all
wrong
as
it
applied
to
England
,
which
was
driving
forward
into
uncharted
waters
,
with
the
danger
of
a
new
tyranny
ahead
.

they
merely
do
their
best
to
make
it
real
for
others
.

He
went
to
the
Hotel
Mayflower
and
telegraphed
Mencken
.

But
none
of
this
could
soothe
the
exacerbated
nerves
.

On
January
4
,
with
the
boys
back
at
school
and
college
,
Mrs.
Lewis
wrote
Harcourt
to
say
that
she
was
through
,
quite
through
.

This
whole
Washington
venture
was
my
last
gesture
,
and
it
has
failed
.

Harcourt
replied
:
I
do
really
hope
you
can
achieve
serenity
in
the
course
of
time
.

Of
course
I
hope
Hal
can
also
,
but
those
hopes
are
much
more
faint
.

on
January
8
,
1927
,
he
returned
to
the
Grosvenor
in
high
spirits
,
and
looking
fit
.

They
were
strays
of
every
kind
--
university
students
and
journalists
,
Village
hangers-on
and
barflies
,
taxi
drivers
and
editors
and
unknown
poets
,
as
well
as
friends
like
Elinor
Wylie
and
William
Rose
Benet
,
the
Van
Dorens
and
Nathan
,
Rebecca
West
and
Hugh
Walpole
and
Osbert
Sitwell
,
Laurence
Stallings
,
Lewis
Browne
,
William
Seabrook
,
Arthur
Hopkins
,
the
Woodwards
.

He
was
outraged
by
the
book
and
announced
that
he
had
discovered
fifty
technical
errors
in
its
account
of
church
practices
.

One
had
it
that
a
friend
,
protesting
her
snobbery
,
said
,
But
,
Gracie
,
you
are
an
American
,
aren't
you
?
?

At
once
upon
his
arrival
,
he
telephoned
Lady
Sybil
Colefax
who
invited
them
to
tea
,
and
then
Lewis
decided
to
give
a
party
as
a
quick
way
of
rounding
up
his
friends
.

When
Blackman
emerged
from
the
bedroom
,
everyone
was
gone
except
the
tolerant
Lord
Thomson
,
who
stayed
and
chatted
with
him
for
half
an
hour
,
and
then
Blackman
lay
awake
most
of
that
night
,
despairing
of
what
he
must
expect
on
the
Continent
.

Lewis
looked
at
him
and
began
to
cry
,
and
then
,
saying
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
promise
,
he
asked
Blackman
to
call
the
porter
and
to
tell
him
to
take
out
all
the
liquor
that
he
did
not
want
.

He
suggested
that
they
call
on
these
brothers
,
who
received
them
pleasantly
.

The
list
was
headed
by
(
Henry
)
Hutton
of
St.
John's
who
was
matriculated
from
St.
John's
at
Easter
,
1625
.

He
proceeded
M.A.
in
1632
,
and
B.D.
in
1639
,
being
made
fellow
in
1632
.

He
was
ordained
deacon
16
June
and
priest
22
December
1633
.

Manningham
also
proceeded
M.A.
in
1632
and
became
a
fellow
of
his
college
in
that
year
.

It
would
,
however
,
reach
the
proctors
and
other
officers
in
charge
of
the
public-school
performances
of
the
incepting
bachelors
,
and
the
place
that
any
individual
obtained
in
the
lists
depended
greatly
on
how
he
comported
himself
in
the
public
schools
during
his
acts
therein
as
he
was
incepting
.

It
differed
from
what
an
undergraduate
receives
today
from
any
American
college
or
university
mainly
in
the
certainty
of
what
he
was
forced
to
learn
compared
with
the
loose
and
widely
scattered
information
obtained
today
by
most
of
our
undergraduates
.

But
his
greatest
achievement
,
in
his
own
eyes
and
in
the
eyes
of
his
colleagues
and
teachers
,
was
his
amazing
ability
to
produce
literary
Latin
pieces
,
and
he
was
often
called
on
to
do
so
.

His
other
activities
are
not
so
easily
recovered
.

The
Gog
Magog
Hills
to
the
southeast
afforded
him
and
all
other
students
a
vantage
point
from
which
to
view
the
town
and
university
of
their
dwelling
.

Ball
games
,
especially
football
,
required
some
attention
,
and
other
organized
sports
may
have
attracted
him
as
participant
or
spectator
.

What
manner
of
person
does
Milton
appear
to
have
been
when
as
an
undergraduate
he
resided
at
Christ's
College
?
?

A
quibusdam
,
,
audivi
nuper
Domina
.

That
is
,
if
we
can
trust
that
most
specious
of
prolusions
,
packed
as
it
is
with
wit
and
persiflage
.

In
short
,
the
traditional
epithet
for
Milton
of
'
Lady
of
Christ's
'
,
while
eminently
fitting
,
rests
only
on
this
baffling
passage
in
the
midst
of
the
most
treacherous
piece
of
writing
Milton
left
us
.

The
entire
exercise
,
Latin
and
English
,
is
most
suggestive
of
the
kind
of
person
Milton
had
become
at
Christ's
during
his
undergraduate
career
;
;

Milton
was
to
act
as
the
archfool
,
the
supreme
wit
,
the
lightly
bantering
pater
,
Pater
Liber
,
who
could
at
once
trip
lightly
over
that
which
deserved
such
treatment
,
or
could
at
will
annihilate
the
common
enemies
of
the
college
gathering
,
and
with
words
alone
.

To
do
this
successfully
required
great
skill
and
a
special
talent
for
both
solemn
and
ribald
raillery
,
a
talent
not
bestowed
on
many
persons
,
but
one
with
which
Milton
was
marked
as
being
endowed
and
in
which
,
at
least
in
this
performance
,
he
obviously
reveled
.

Perhaps
his
most
important
private
activity
was
the
combination
of
reading
,
discussion
with
a
few
--
if
we
can
trust
his
writings
to
Diodati
and
the
younger
Gill
,
very
few
--
congenial
companions
.

A
man
could
travel
anywhere
he
pleased
,
eat
whatever
he
fancied
--
without
handing
over
any
money
.

And
they
have
done
this
on
a
very
large
scale
,
with
a
veritable
flood
of
novels
and
stories
which
are
either
dystopias
or
narratives
of
adventure
with
dystopian
elements
.

James
Blish's
A
Case
Of
Conscience
(
1958
)
describes
a
world
hiding
from
its
own
weapons
of
destruction
in
underground
shelters
;
;

Frederick
Pohl's
The
Midas
Touch
(
1954
)
predicts
an
economy
of
abundance
which
,
in
order
to
remain
prosperous
,
must
set
its
robots
to
consuming
surplus
production
;
;

Since
the
great
flood
of
these
dystopias
has
appeared
only
in
the
last
twelve
years
,
it
seems
fairly
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
chief
impetus
was
the
1949
publication
of
Nineteen
Eighty-Four
,
an
assumption
which
is
supported
by
the
frequent
echoes
of
such
details
as
Room
101
,
along
with
education
by
conditioning
from
Brave
New
World
,
a
book
to
which
science-fiction
writers
may
well
have
returned
with
new
interest
after
reading
the
more
powerful
Orwell
dystopia
.

and
among
works
of
dystopian
science
fiction
,
not
all
provide
intelligent
criticism
and
very
few
have
much
merit
as
literature
--
but
then
real
quality
has
always
been
scarce
in
science
fiction
.

How
effectively
these
warnings
can
be
presented
is
seen
in
Pohl
and
Kornbluth's
The
Space
Merchants
,
Vonnegut's
Player
Piano
and
Wyndham's
Re-Birth
.

Easily
the
best
known
of
these
three
novels
is
The
Space
Merchants
,
a
good
example
of
a
science-fiction
dystopia
which
extrapolates
much
more
than
the
impact
of
science
on
human
life
,
though
its
most
important
warning
is
in
this
area
,
namely
as
to
the
use
to
which
discoveries
in
the
behavioral
sciences

The
Space
Merchants
,
like
such
humanist
documents
as
Joseph
Wood
Krutch's
The
Measure
Of
Man
and
C.
S.
Lewis's
The
Abolition
Of
Man
,
considers
what
may
result
from
the
scientific
study
of
human
nature
.

Indeed
,
again
and
again
,
the
space
merchants
confirm
the
prediction
of
the
humanists
that
the
conditioners
and
behavioral
scientists
,
once
they
have
seen
through
human
nature
,
will
have
nothing
except
their
impulses
and
desires
to
guide
them
.

Young
for
his
age
means
only
the
presence
of
some
minor
characteristic
not
quite
usual
.

An
assumption
of
youth
,
or
the
presence
of
a
few
youthful
characteristics
,
deceives
no
more
successfully
than
rouge
or
dyed
hair
.

Youth
may
be
,
and
often
is
,
skeptical
,
cynical
or
despairing
;
;

If
it
proclaims
that
the
best
is
yet
to
be
,
it
always
arouses
,
at
least
in
the
young
,
either
a
suspicious
question
or
perhaps
the
exclamation
of
the
Negro
youth
who
saw
on
a
tombstone
the
inscription
,
I
am
not
dead
but
sleeping
.

Boy
,
you
ain't
fooling
nobody
but
yourself
.

No
good
can
come
of
contemplating
the
sad
,
inevitable
fact
that
once
youth
has
passed
a
worse
and
worse
time
still
succeeds
the
former
.

Even
to
be
from
hope
and
fear
set
free
is
at
least
better
than
to
have
lost
the
first
without
having
got
rid
of
the
second
.

But
at
least
the
question
has
been
raised
.

Let
me
then
(
and
in
public
)
glance
into
the
mirror
.

I
have
changed
and
I
have
reversed
opinions
;
;

but
I
am
so
aware
of
an
uninterrupted
continuity
of
the
persona
or
ego
that
I
see
only
as
absurd
the
tendency
of
some
psychologists
from
Heraclitus
to
Pirandello
and
Proust
to
regard
consciousness
as
no
more
than
a
flux
amid
which
nothing
remains
unchanged
.

So
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
the
child
is
unmistakably
father
to
the
man
,
despite
the
obvious
fact
that
child
and
father
differ
greatly
--
sometimes
for
the
better
and
sometimes
for
the
worse
.

But
in
ways
more
fundamental
than
specific
political
opinions
they
are
still
what
they
always
were
:
passionate
,
sure
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
of
whatever
it
is
that
they
are
sure
of
,
capable
of
seeing
black
and
white
only
and
,
therefore
,
committed
to
the
logical
extreme
of
whatever
it
is
they
are
temporarily
committed
to
.

Yet
during
the
years
when
I
was
on
the
staff
of
The
Nation
,
I
tried
to
the
limit
the
patience
of
the
editors
on
almost
every
occasion
when
I
was
permitted
to
write
an
editorial
having
a
bearing
on
a
political
or
social
question
.

Many
of
my
friends
at
the
time
thought
that
I
had
received
a
well-deserved
condemnation
when
Lincoln
Steffens
denounced
me
in
a
review
of
one
of
my
books
as
a
perfect
example
of
the
obsolete
man
who
could
understand
and
sympathize
only
with
the
dead
past
.

Once
many
years
ago
I
sat
at
dinner
next
to
Arthur
Train
,
and
the
subject
of
The
Nation
came
up
.

Why
did
I
choose
to
fill
these
pages
in
this
particular
issue
with
this
mixture
of
rather
tenuous
reflections
and
autobiography
?
?

But
one
need
not
always
be
sure
that
the
action
is
either
wise
or
conclusive
.

It
concerns
a
small-town
minister
who
staged
an
impressive
object
lesson
by
confining
a
lion
and
a
lamb
together
in
the
same
cage
outside
his
church
door
.

Not
only
his
parishioners
,
but
the
whole
town
and
,
ultimately
,
the
whole
county
were
enormously
impressed
by
this
object
lesson
.

What
is
the
trick
?
?

The
promise
that
the
lion
and
the
lamb
will
lie
down
together
was
given
in
the
future
tense
.

Without
really
changing
the
general
subject
,
I
take
this
opportunity
to
confess
that
I
am
troubled
by
doubts
,
not
only
about
pacifism
,
but
also
when
asked
to
join
in
the
protest
against
a
law
that
most
of
those
who
consider
themselves
humane
and
liberal
seem
to
regard
as
obviously
barbarous
;
;

In
fact
I
cannot
imagine
myself
condemning
a
man
to
the
noose
or
the
electric
chair
if
I
had
to
take
,
as
an
individual
,
the
responsibility
for
his
death
.

Just
as
I
know
I
would
make
a
bad
soldier
even
though
I
cannot
sincerely
call
myself
a
pacifist
,
so
too
I
would
not
be
either
a
hangman
by
profession
or
,
if
I
could
avoid
it
,
even
a
member
of
a
hanging
jury
.

Despite
these
facts
the
question
:
:

Seems
to
me
to
create
a
dilemma
not
to
be
satisfactorily
disposed
of
by
a
simple
negative
answer
.

Andre
Malraux's
The
Walnut
Trees
Of
Altenburg
was
written
in
the
early
years
of
the
second
World
War
,
during
a
period
of
enforced
leisure
when
he
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
Germans
after
the
fall
of
France
.

If
we
are
to
believe
the
list
of
titles
printed
in
Malraux's
latest
book
,
La
Metamorphose
Des
Dieux
,
Vol.
1
(
(
1957
)
,
he
is
still
engaged
in
writing
a
large
novel
under
his
original
title
.

This
magnificent
but
greatly
underestimated
book
,
which
bodies
forth
the
very
form
and
pressure
of
its
time
as
no
other
comparable
creation
,
has
suffered
severely
from
having
been
written
about
an
historical
event
--
the
Spanish
Civil
War
--
that
is
still
capable
of
fanning
the
smoldering
fires
of
old
political
feuds
.

Even
so
apparently
impartial
a
critic
as
W.
H.
Frohock
has
taken
for
granted
that
the
book
was
originally
intended
as
a
piece
of
Loyalist
propaganda
;
;

and
the
more
the
action
claims
to
be
total
,
the
smaller
is
the
part
of
man
engaged
.

It
is
this
larger
theme
of
the
quality
of
man
,
a
quality
that
transcends
the
ideological
and
flows
into
the
human
,
which
now
forms
the
pulsating
heart
of
Malraux's
artistic
universe
.

The
Walnut
Trees
Of
Altenburg
is
composed
in
the
form
of
a
triptych
,
with
the
two
small
side
panels
framing
and
enclosing
the
main
central
episode
of
the
novel
.

The
narrator
is
an
Alsatian
serving
with
the
French
Army
,
and
he
has
the
same
name
(
Berger
)
that
Malraux
himself
was
later
to
use
in
the
Resistance
;
;

What
does
the
narrator
see
and
what
does
he
feel
?
?

This
new
vision
of
man
that
the
narrator
acquires
is
also
accompanied
by
a
re-vision
of
his
previous
view
.

The
men
around
him
,
observes
the
narrator
,
have
been
living
from
day
to
day
for
thousands
of
years
.

and
the
narrator
recalls
the
words
of
his
father
,
Vincent
Berger
:
It
is
not
by
any
amount
of
scratching
at
the
individual
that
one
finally
comes
down
to
mankind
.

The
entire
middle
section
of
The
Walnut
Trees
is
taken
up
with
the
life
of
Vincent
Berger
himself
,
whose
fragmentary
notes
on
his
encounters
with
mankind
are
now
conveyed
by
his
son
.

And
,
after
becoming
the
right-hand
man
of
Enver
Pasha
,
he
is
sent
by
the
latter
to
pave
the
way
for
a
new
Turkish
Empire
embracing
the
union
of
all
Turks
throughout
Central
Asia
from
Adrianople
to
the
Chinese
oases
on
the
Silk
Trade
Route
.

and
amid
a
dusty
desolation
in
which
nothing
human
any
longer
seemed
to
survive
,
Vincent
Berger
begins
to
dream
of
the
Occident
.

But
as
he
discovers
shortly
,
on
returning
among
intellectuals
obsessed
by
le
culte
du
moi
,
his
experience
of
action
had
also
taught
him
a
more
positive
lesson
.

And
when
Vincent
Berger
returns
to
Europe
,
this
first
result
of
his
encounters
with
mankind
is
considerably
enriched
and
deepened
by
a
crucial
revelation
.

We
need
joint
chiefs
of
a
political
general
staff
.

Thus
far
the
advances
made
have
been
almost
entirely
along
functional
lines
.

The
Communist
coup
in
Czechoslovakia
in
1948
was
followed
immediately
by
the
conclusion
of
the
Brussels
Treaty
,
a
50-year
alliance
among
Britain
,
France
and
the
Benelux
countries
.

The
overseas
democracies
have
generally
encouraged
the
European
unification
movement
without
seriously
considering
the
wisdom
of
their
own
full
participation
in
a
broader
Atlantic
community
.

The
problem
of
NATO
is
not
one
of
machinery
,
of
which
there
is
an
abundance
,
but
of
the
will
to
use
it
.

There
is
nothing
new
in
this
;
;

what
is
new
and
compelling
is
that
the
West
is
now
but
one
of
several
powerful
civilizations
,
or
systems
,
and
that
one
or
more
of
the
others
may
pose
a
mortal
danger
to
the
West
.

The
burden
of
these
reflections
is
that
a
broader
unity
among
the
free
nations
is
at
the
core
of
our
needs
.

In
a
recent
book
called
World
Peace
Through
World
Law
,
two
distinguished
lawyers
,
Grenville
Clark
and
Louis
Sohn
,
call
for
just
such
an
overhaul
of
the
U.N.
,
basing
their
case
on
the
world-wide
fear
of
a
nuclear
holocaust
.

A
working
concept
of
the
organic
evolution
of
community
must
lead
us
in
a
different
direction
.

The
trouble
with
this
machinery
is
that
it
is
not
used
and
the
reason
that
it
is
not
used
is
the
absence
of
a
conscious
sense
of
community
among
the
free
nations
.

A
concert
of
free
nations
should
take
its
inspiration
from
the
traditions
of
the
nineteenth
century
Concert
of
Europe
with
its
common
values
and
accepted
rules
of
the
game
.

Constitutions
of
and
by
themselves
mean
little
;
;

the
history
of
both
the
League
of
Nations
and
the
United
Nations
demonstrates
that
.

Rexroth
and
Patchen
are
far
apart
musically
and
poetically
in
their
experiments
.

However
,
his
subject
matter
and
basic
themes
have
remained
surprisingly
consistent
,
and
these
,
together
with
certain
key
poetic
images
,
may
be
traced
through
all
his
work
,
including
the
new
jazz
experiments
.

Patchen
believes
that
the
world
is
being
destroyed
by
power-hungry
and
money-hungry
people
.

Running
counter
to
the
destroying
forces
in
the
world
are
all
the
virtues
that
are
innate
in
man
,
the
capacity
for
love
and
brotherhood
,
the
ability
to
appreciate
beauty
.

This
salvation
does
not
take
the
form
of
a
Christian
Heaven
.

He
is
usually
something
of
an
underdog
,
he
must
battle
the
organized
police
force
as
well
as
recognized
criminals
.

he
has
become
Friday
on
Dragnet
,
a
mouthpiece
of
arbitrary
police
authority
.

The
revolution
in
jazz
that
took
place
around
1949
,
the
evolution
from
the
bebop
school
of
Dizzy
Gillespie
to
the
cool
sound
of
Miles
Davis
and
Lennie
Tristano
,
Lee
Konitz
,
and
the
whole
legend
of
Charlie
Parker
,
had
made
an
impression
on
many
academic
and
literary
men
.

The
musician
is
non-intellectual
and
non-verbal
;
;

Many
of
these
aspects
will
be
seen
as
comparable
to
those
of
the
ideal
detective
,
but
where
the
detective
is
active
and
militant
,
the
jazz
musician
is
passive
,
almost
a
victim
of
society
.

This
involves
a
shift
in
Patchen's
attitude
and
it
is
a
first
step
toward
writing
a
new
jazz
poetry
.

He
has
shown
considerable
ingenuity
in
adapting
his
earliest
symbols
and
devices
to
the
new
work
,
and
the
fact
that
he
has
kept
a
body
of
constant
symbols
through
all
of
his
experiments
gives
an
unexpected
continuity
to
his
poetry
.

His
revolutionary
anger
is
apparent
in
most
of
his
early
poems
.

The
following
passage
from
The
Hangman's
Great
Hands
illustrates
the
directness
of
this
anger
.

Although
it
does
not
follow
the
metrical
rules
for
a
blues
to
be
sung
,
the
phrases
themselves
carry
a
blues
feeling
.

Oh
,
can't
hold
the
han'
of
my
love
!
!

Can't
hold
her
little
white
han'
!
!

Oh
,
can't
hold
the
han'
of
my
love
!
!

Can't
hold
her
pure
little
han'
!
!

Neither
of
these
poems
is
an
aberration
;
;

each
is
so
typical
that
it
represents
a
prominent
trend
in
the
poet's
development
.

In
many
of
his
poems
,
death
comes
by
train
:
a
strongly
evocative
visual
image
.

Let
us
see
just
how
typical
Krim
is
.

He
is
New
York-born
and
Jewish
.

But
I've
got
news
for
Krim
:
he's
not
typical
,
he's
pretty
special
.

Men
of
Krim's
age
,
aspirations
,
and
level
of
sophistication
were
typically
involved
in
politics
before
the
war
.

They
did
not
duck
the
war
but
they
fought
in
it
,
however
reluctantly
;
;

they
did
not
fall
into
pseudo-glamorous
jobs
on
pseudo-glamorous
magazines
,
but
they
did
whatever
nasty
thing
they
could
get
in
order
to
eat
;
;

Only
a
native
New
Yorker
could
believe
that
New
York
is
now
or
ever
was
a
literary
center
.

Closely
related
to
his
illusions
about
his
typicality
is
Krim's
complicated
feeling
about
his
Jewishness
.

He
writes
,
Most
of
my
friends
and
I
were
Jewish
;
;

we
were
also
literary
;
;

We
all
love
to
suffer
,
but
some
of
us
love
to
suffer
more
than
others
.

More
important
is
the
simple
human
point
that
all
men
suffer
,
and
that
it
is
a
kind
of
anthropological-religious
pride
on
the
part
of
the
Jew
to
believe
that
his
suffering
is
more
poignant
than
mine
or
anyone
else's
.

In
their
stupidity
and
arrogance
they
believe
they
are
called
upon
to
remind
the
gentile
continually
of
pogroms
and
ghettos
.

Kenyon
,
Sewanee
,
and
Hudson
operated
in
an
Anglo-Protestant
New
Critical
chill
;
;

Qui
s'excuse
s'accuse
,
as
the
French
Jewish
intellectuals
used
to
say
.

What
Krim
ignores
,
in
his
contempt
for
history
and
for
accuracy
,
is
that
these
magazines
,
Partisan
foremost
,
brought
about
a
genuine
revolution
in
the
American
mind
from
the
mid-thirties
to
approximately
1950
.

The
most
obvious
characteristic
of
contemporary
American
writing
,
apart
from
the
beat
nonsense
,
is
its
cosmopolitanism
.

Without
the
good
magazines
,
without
their
book
reviews
,
their
hospitality
to
European
writers
,
without
above
all
their
awareness
of
literary
standards
,
we
might
very
well
have
had
a
generation
of
Krim's
heroes
--
Wolfes
,
Farrells
,
Dreisers
,
and
I
might
add
,
Sandburgs
and
Frosts
and
MacLeishes
in
verse
--
and
then
where
would
we
be
?

atmosphere

This
Partisan
above
all
did
;
;

the
result
was
his
inevitable
bedazzlement
through
,
ignorance
.

The
Italians
felt
it
.

But
,
who
knew
,
that
might
be
coming
one
of
these
days
.

He
was
interested
in
Robert
Musil's
The
Man
Without
Qualities
.

This
one
was
going
to
be
different
.

He
had
bought
a
little
piece
of
property
down
along
the
coast
of
the
hard
country
of
Calabria
that
he
knew
so
well
.

He
was
going
to
do
one
or
two
more
films
for
cash
and
then
chuck
it
all
,
leave
Rome
and
its
intellectual
cliques
and
money-fed
life
,
go
back
to
Calabria
.

When
they
lost
it
,
the
French
artillery
moved
in
,
and
that
was
the
end
for
Garibaldi
that
time
,
on
30
April
1849
.

We
had
walked
it
many
times
and
shivered
,
figuring
what
a
fish
barrel
it
had
been
for
the
French
.

Now
the
park
is
filled
with
marble
busts
and
all
the
streets
in
the
immediate
area
have
the
full
and
proper
names
of
the
men
who
fell
.

It
was
a
picked
assault
company
.

The
sculptor
looked
at
him
,
let
the
color
drain
out
of
his
face
,
grinned
,
and
looked
down
into
his
drink
,
a
bad
Martini
made
with
raw
Italian
gin
.

Bullshit
,
he
said
softly
.

For
one
thing
,
there
wasn't
going
to
be
any
ceremony
at
all
this
year
.

His
bust
shows
an
intense
,
mustached
,
fine-featured
face
.

Faced
with
a
gesture
like
Di
Bosis'
,
I
find
usually
that
my
sentiments
are
closer
to
those
of
my
sculptor
friend
.

No
poetry
,
no
airplanes
,
no
dancers
.

That
is
how
the
real
routine
of
resistance
goes
on
,
and
its
strength
is
directly
proportionate
to
the
number
of
insignificant
people
who
can
let
themselves
be
taken
to
pieces
,
piece
by
piece
,
without
quitting
.

The
English
lady
wanted
to
pay
tribute
to
Garibaldi
and
to
Lauro
Di
Bosis
,
but
she
wasn't
going
to
be
here
to
do
it
.

There
was
a
pretty
thorough
silence
at
that
point
.

My
spoon
stirring
coffee
,
banging
against
the
side
of
the
cup
,
sounded
as
loud
as
a
bell
.

I
thought
:
What
the
hell
?
?

I
said
I
would
do
it
for
her
.

Like
every
Southerner
I
can't
escape
the
romantic
tradition
of
brave
defeats
,
forlorn
lost
causes

As

the
system
is
beneficial
to
local
communities
and
encourages
the
development
of
industries
in
rural
areas
.

To
encourage
exploration
for
domestic
sources
of
minerals
,
the
Office
of
Minerals
Exploration
(
OME
)
of
the
U.S.
Department
of
the
Interior
offers
financial
assistance
to
firms
and
individuals
who
desire
to
explore
their
properties
or
claims
for
1
or
more
of
the
32
mineral
commodities
listed
in
the
OME
regulations
.

This
help
is
offered
to
applicants
who
ordinarily
would
not
undertake
the
exploration
under
present
conditions
or
circumstances
at
their
sole
expense
and
who
are
unable
to
obtain
funds
from
commercial
sources
on
reasonable
terms
.

Funds
contributed
by
the
Government
are
repaid
by
a
royalty
on
production
from
the
property
.

If
nothing
is
produced
,
there
is
no
obligation
to
repay
.

The
royalty
applies
to
both
principal
and
interest
,
but
it
never
exceeds
5
percent
.

Only
a
very
few
of
the
more
advanced
ones
,
such
as
India
and
Pakistan
,
have
developed
systematic
techniques
of
programing
.

Others
have
so-called
development
plans
,
but
some
of
these
are
little
more
than
lists
of
projects
collected
from
various
ministries
while
others
are
statements
of
goals
without
analysis
of
the
actions
required
to
attain
them
.

External
aid
can
only
be
marginal
,
although
the
margin
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
Marshall
plan
,
can
be
decisive
.

Aid
advice
is
not
interference

Otherwise
,
development
will
not
lead
to
longrun
stability
.

In
many
societies
,
what
we
regard
as
corruption
,
favoritism
,
and
personal
influence
are
so
accepted
as
consistent
with
the
mores
of
officialdom
and
so
integral
a
part
of
routine
administrative
practice
that
any
attempt
to
force
their
elimination
will
be
regarded
by
the
local
leadership
as
not
only
unwarranted
but
unfriendly
.

The
United
States
can
use
its
aid
as
an
incentive
to
self-help
by
responding
with
aid
on
a
sustained
basis
,
tailored
to
priority
needs
,
to
those
countries
making
serious
efforts
in
self-help
.

The
most
fundamental
concept
of
the
new
approach
to
economic
aid
is
the
focusing
of
our
attention
,
our
resources
,
and
our
energies
on
the
effort
to
promote
the
economic
and
social
development
of
the
less
developed
countries
.

The
whole
program
must
be
conceived
of
as
an
effort
,
stretching
over
a
considerable
number
of
years
,
to
alter
the
basic
social
and
economic
conditions
in
the
less
developed
world
.

It
must
be
recognized
as
a
slow-acting
tool
designed
to
prevent
political
and
military
crises
such
as
those
recently
confronted
in
Laos
and
Cuba
.

Thus
,
as
a
development
program
is
being
launched
,
commitments
and
obligations
must
be
entered
into
in
a
given
year
which
may
exceed
by
twofold
or
threefold
the
expenditures
to
be
made
in
that
year
.

The
capital
expansion
programs
of
business
firms
involve
multi-year
budgeting
and
the
same
is
true
of
country
development
programs
.

If
they
feel
that
we
are
taking
a
long-term
view
of
their
problems
and
are
prepared
to
enter
into
reasonably
long-term
association
with
them
in
their
development
activities
,
they
will
be
much
more
likely
to
undertake
the
difficult
tasks
required
.

Perhaps
the
most
important
incentive
for
them
will
be
clear
evidence
that
where
other
countries
have
done
this
kind
of
home
work
we
have
responded
with
long-term
commitments
.

Remarks
of
Hon.
Wayne
L.
Hays
of
Ohio

He
has
become
in
this
half
century
the
grand
old
man
of
American
history
.

But
the
task
is
beyond
me
because
I
hold
it
impossible
to
compress
in
a
sentence
or
two
the
complicated
and
prodigious
contributions
Sam
Rayburn
has
made
as
an
individual
,
as
a
legislator
,
as
a
statesman
and
as
a
leader
and
conciliator
,
to
the
majestic
progress
of
this
Nation
.

And
,
if
we
follow
the
Rayburn
pattern
,
as
consciously
or
by
an
instinctual
political
sense
I
like
to
think
I
have
followed
it
,
then
the
very
nature
of
our
loyalty
to
our
own
immediate
areas
must
necessarily
be
reflected
in
the
devotion
of
our
services
to
our
country
.

There
is
no
such
thing
as
being
diligent
about
national
affairs
but
indifferent
about
home
needs
.

More
than
that
,
Sam
Rayburn
is
the
very
living
symbol
of
an
iron-clad
integrity
so
powerful
in
his
nature
and
so
constantly
demonstrated
that
he
can
count
some
of
his
best
friends
in
the
opposition
.

It
is
an
answer
in
its
way
,
individual
and
highly
dramatic
,
to
the
charge
that
the
democratic
process
is
necessarily
vicious
in
its
campaign
characteristics
.

All
but
two
of
my
nine
terms
in
the
House
of
Representatives
has
been
served
under
the
Speakership
of
Sam
Rayburn
.

No
one
could
be
more
devoted
than
he
to
the
American
Congress
as
an
institution
and
more
aware
of
its
historical
significance
in
the
political
history
of
the
world
,
and
I
shall
never
forget
his
moving
talks
,
delivered
in
simple
yet
eloquent
words
,
upon
the
meaning
of
our
jobs
as
Representatives
in
the
operation
of
representative
government
and
their
importance
in
the
context
of
today's
assault
upon
popular
government
.

The
practice
of
state-owned
vehicles
for
use
of
employees
on
business
dates
back
over
forty
years
.

Purchase
of
state
vehicles
is
handled
similarly
to
all
state
purchases
.

The
legislature's
role
in
policy
determination
concerning
state-owned
vehicles
has
been
confined
almost
exclusively
to
appropriating
funds
for
vehicles
.

The
purchase
of
compact
(
economy
)
cars
is
being
made
currently
on
a
test
basis
.

Forty-seven
states
assign
or
provide
vehicles
for
employees
on
state
business
.

Rhode
Island's
reimburseable
rate
of
$.07
per
mile
for
use
of
personally-owned
cars
compares
favorably
with
other
states'
rates
.

The
average
of
states'
rates
is
$.076
per
mile
.

Actual
mileage
allowances
are
well-administered
and
not
unduly
expensive
for
the
state
.

With
few
exceptions
travelers
on
state
business
are
allowed
actual
travel
expenses
and
$15
per
day
subsistence
.

Travel
allowances
are
well-regulated
and
pose
little
problem
in
administration
audit
control
.

Few
records
are
available
concerning
the
subject
prior
to
1940
.

Using
privately-owned
vehicles
was
a
personal
hardship
for
such
employees
,
and
the
matter
of
providing
state
transportation
was
felt
perfectly
justifiable
.

The
management
of
state-owned
vehicles
since
that
time
has
been
described
in
a
recent
report
in
the
following
manner
:

This
tied
in
closely
with
the
current
attempt
to
upgrade
state-owned
cars
to
the
extent
that
vehicles
are
not
retained
beyond
the
point
where
maintenance
costs
(
in
light
of
depreciation
)
become
excessive
.

The
reasons
are
obvious
:
(
1
)
the
state
is
buying
in
quantity
,
and
(
2
)
it
has
no
federal
excise
or
state
sales
tax
to
pay
.

In
that
ownership
of
all
vehicles
rests
with
the
state
motor
pool
,
cars
are
paid
for
with
funds
appropriated
to
the
agencies
but
transferred
to
the
rotary
fund
mentioned
earlier
.

There
was
a
time
some
years
ago
when
local
taxation
by
the
cities
and
towns
was
sufficient
to
support
their
own
operations
and
a
part
of
the
cost
of
the
state
government
as
well
.

Among
the
many
problems
in
the
taxing
of
personal
property
,
and
of
movable
tangible
property
in
particular
,
two
are
significant
:
(
1
)
situs
,
(
2
)
fair
and
equitable
assessment
of
value
.

It
also
provides
for
the
taxation
of
all
personal
property
,
belonging
to
inhabitants
of
the
state
,
both
tangible
and
intangible
,
and
the
tangible
personal
property
of
non-residents
in
this
state
.

In
defining
personal
property
,
it
specifically
mentions
all
ships
or
vessels
,
at
home
or
abroad
.

The
location
of
the
latter
now
is
determined
for
tax
purposes
at
the
time
of
registration
,
and
it
is
now
accepted
practice
to
consider
a
motor
vehicle
as
being
situated
where
it
is
garaged
.

An
adequately
staffed
and
equipped
State
assessing
office
could
apply
uniform
methods
and
standards
which
would
go
far
toward
producing
equitable
assessments
on
all
properties
throughout
the
State
.

To
determine
the
practice
and
attitude
of
municipal
governments
concerning
tangible
movable
property
,
a
questionnaire
was
sent
to
all
local
government
assessors
or
boards
of
assessors
in
Rhode
Island
.

In
reply
to
a
question
of
whether
they
now
tax
boats
,
airplanes
and
other
movable
property
excluding
automobiles
,
nineteen
said
that
they
did
and
twenty
that
they
did
not
.

One
assessor
checked
boats
only
,
another
trailers
and
tractors
,
one
mentioned
house
trailers
,
and
two
others
referred
to
trailers
without
specifying
the
type
.

In
two
cases
,
airplanes
only
were
indicated
.

It
is
difficult
to
tabulate
exactly
what
was
meant
in
each
individual
situation
,
but
the
conclusion
may
be
drawn
that
21
towns
do
not
assess
movable
personal
property
,
and
of
the
remainder
only
certain
types
are
valued
for
tax
purposes
.

It
would
seem
,
then
,
that
movable
property
and
equipment
is
not
taxed
as
a
whole
but
that
certain
types
are
taxed
in
towns
where
this
is
bound
to
be
expedient
for
that
particular
kind
of
personal
property
.

To
summarize
,
it
may
be
said
that
there
is
no
one
prevailing
practice
in
Rhode
Island
with
respect
to
the
taxation
of
movable
property
,
that
assessors
would
like
to
see
an
improvement
,
and
of
those
who
have
an
opinion
,
that
assessment
by
the
town
of
location
is
preferred
on
the
basis
of
their
present
knowledge
.

Interest
has
been
shown
for
a
number
of
years
by
local
assessors
in
the
possibility
of
taxing
boats
.

Assessors
in
Rhode
Island
are
charged
not
only
with
placing
a
valuation
upon
real
and
personal
property
,
but
they
also
have
the
responsibility
to
raise
by
a
tax
a
sum
not
less
than
nor
more
than
a
specified
amount
as
ordered
by
a
city
council
or
financial
town
meeting
.

It
has
been
obvious
to
the
assessors
,
particularly
those
in
shore
communities
,
that
boats
comprise
the
largest
category
of
tangible
personal
property
which
they
have
been
unable
to
reach
.

The
assessors'
association
,
meeting
at
Narragansett
in
September
1960
,
devoted
its
session
to
a
discussion
of
the
boat
problem
.

A
primary
function
is
the
operation
of
a
Government
Bid
Center
,
which
receives
bids
daily
from
the
Federal
Government's
principal
purchasing
agencies

issued
an
extremely
comprehensive
report
entitled
State-Local
Relations
In
Metropolitan
Rhode
Island
.

First
priority
will
be
given
to
the
preparation
of
a
meaningful
state
guide
plan
to
serve
as
a
background
for
all
other
planning
activities
in
the
state
.

Recognizing
the
truth
of
the
statement
by
the
Institute
of
Public
Administration
that
Metropolian
Planning
(
in
Rhode
Island
)
means
,
or
should
mean
,
state
planning
,
the
state
guide
plan
will
take
into
account
the
metropolitan
nature
of
many
of
Rhode
Island's
problems
.

The
state
development
budget
will
reflect
the
capital
needs
of
all
the
state
agencies
and
the
priority
of
the
projects
in
the
budget
will
be
based
on
the
state
plan
.

Functionally
the
planning
division
carries
out
four
activities
:
long-range
state
planning
,
current
state
planning
,
local
planning
assistance
;
;

It
is
not
within
the
scope
of
this
report
to
elaborate
in
any
great
detail
upon
special
districts
in
Rhode
Island
.

However
,
a
word
should
be
mentioned
in
regard
to
them
as
independent
units
of
government
.

Unlike
cities
and
towns
,
however
,
they
do
not
have
to
submit
any
financial
statements
to
the
state
Bureau
of
Audits
.

In
eight
states
whose
fiscal
years
close
on
June
30
,
a
majority
of
their
cities
close
their
fiscal
year
on
December
31
:
:

(
Georgia
,
Iowa
,
Kentucky
,
Maine
,
Maryland
,
Minnesota
,
Virginia
,
and
South
Carolina
)
.

He
listed
among
the
values
of
fiscal
uniformity
:
1
.

The
uniform
fiscal
year
ensures
conformance
with
another
common
sense
rule
,
that
of
having
cash
in
the
bank
before
checks
are
drawn
.

This
greatly
simplifies
the
town's
bookkeeping
and
financial
reporting
.

Borrowing
in
anticipation
of
current
taxes
and
other
revenues
is
a
routine
procedure
of
the
majority
of
municipalities
at
all
times
.

These
involve
more
the
mechanics
employed
in
adjusting
to
fiscal
uniformity
than
they
do
actual
disadvantages
to
the
principle
.

The
advantages
of
a
uniform
fiscal
year
and
well
synchronized
fiscal
and
tax
collection
calendars
are
sufficiently
great
for
Rhode
Island
municipalities
to
exert
effort
to
secure
them
.

Twelve
cities
and
towns
in
Rhode
Island
presently
indicate
some
plans
to
establish
a
uniform
coordinated
fiscal
tax
year
calendar
.

Plans
vary
from
the
talking
stage
to
establishing
special
committees
to
accomplish
this
end
.

The
adjustments
needed
to
establish
a
uniform
and
coordinated
fiscal
tax
collection
year
calendar
throughout
Rhode
Island
,
based
on
a
July
1
to
June
30
year
,
are
shown
below
.

These
cities
and
towns
include
Bristol
,
Glocester
,
Pawtucket
,
Cumberland
,
Central
Falls
,
and
Woonsocket
.

Two
cities
to
be
considered
,
Providence
and
Cranston
,
are
an
enigma
.

However
,
neither
of
these
two
cities
is
on
the
desired
July
1
to
June
30
fiscal
year
.

Methods
of
financing
adjustments

Aside
from
the
matter
of
adjusting
the
fiscal
and
tax
calendars
,
there
is
the
problem
of
financing
the
adjustment
when
this
is
necessary
.

It
should
be
emphasized
strongly
that
adjustments
in
fiscal
dates
or
adoption
of
interim
budgets
do
not
necessarily
mean
financing
over
and
above
normal
governmental
requirements
.

In
many
communities
there
is
simply
no
financial
problem
;
;

it
is
only
a
matter
of
adjusting
accounting
methods
,
careful
fiscal
planning
and
management
,
or
some
like
combination
of
techniques
.

Fortunately
,
such
cases
in
Rhode
Island
are
more
the
exception
than
the
rule
.

In
addition
,
no
two
Rhode
Island
communities
are
identical
in
relation
to
their
over-all
financial
condition
.

It
commemorates
the
185th
anniversary
of
Rhode
Island's
Independence
when
,
upon
May
4
,
1776
,
the
General
Assembly
,
by
its
action
,
established
the
first
free
republic
in
the
New
World
.

On
April
30
,
ceremonies
commemorating
the
departure
of
these
volunteers
will
take
place
at
1:00
P.M.
at
the
Dexter
Training
Grounds
in
Providence
.

The
year
1961
marks
the
fourteenth
anniversary
of
the
unification
of
our
Armed
Forces
under
the
National
Security
Act
of
1947
.

It
is
a
sound
investment
.

It
is
the
purpose
of
Armed
Forces
Day
to
give
Americans
an
opportunity
to
honor
men
of
the
Armed
Forces
,
those
who
have
made
the
supreme
sacrifice
,
those
who
remain
to
preserve
our
security
.

Miss
Rhode
Island
Pageant
Week
proclamation
by
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
Governor

Many
hours
are
given
free
by
the
Jaycees
to
make
this
and
all
local
pageants
outstanding
events
.

Proceeds
realized
from
these
pageants
are
used
by
the
Jaycees
to
help
support
their
various
youth
,
health
,
welfare
and
community
betterment
activities
throughout
the
state
.

and
now
,
therefore
,
do
I
,
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
governor
of
the
State
of
Rhode
Island
and
Providence
Plantations
,
proclaim
Tuesday
,
October
24th
,
1961
,
as
United
Nations
day
,
calling
upon
all
our
citizens
to
engage
in
appropriate
observances
,
demonstrating
faith
in
the
United
Nations
and
thereby
contributing
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
aims
of
the
United
Nations
throughout
the
land
.

In
testimony
whereof
,
I
have
hereunto
set
my
hand
and
caused
the
seal
of
the
State
to
be
affixed
this
5th
day
of
July
,
in
the
year
of
Our
Lord
,
one
thousand
nine
hundred
and
sixty-one
,
and
of
Independence
,
the
one
hundred
and
eighty-sixth
.

Ballet
flowered
in
Italy
during
the
next
hundred
years
,
and
about
1550
was
carried
to
France
when
the
Italian
princess
,
Catherine
De
Medicis
,
married
the
King
of
France
.

Ballets
were
used
in
opera
from
its
beginning
.

The
Pilgrims
gathered
to
thank
the
Lord
for
His
benevolence
during
their
first
year
in
the
new
land
.

We
who
are
living
today
may
learn
a
valuable
lesson
from
those
who
celebrated
the
first
Thanksgiving
Day
.

The
Lord
has
shown
time
and
time
again
His
love
for
us
.

It
is
at
this
time
that
we
should
imitate
the
Pilgrims
by
accompanying
our
prayers
of
thanks
with
the
conviction
that
we
shall
continue
to
be
in
dire
need
for
the
Lord's
protection
in
the
future
,
if
we
are
to
have
peace
;
;

In
view
of
the
increasing
shortage
of
usable
surface
and
ground
water
in
many
parts
of
the
Nation
and
the
importance
of
finding
new
sources
of
supply
to
meet
its
present
and
future
water
needs
,
it
is
the
policy
of
the
Congress
to
provide
for
the
development
of
practicable
low-cost
means
for
the
large-scale
production
of
water
of
a
quality
suitable
for
municipal
,
industrial
,
agricultural
,
and
other
beneficial
consumptive
uses
from
saline
water
,
and
for
studies
and
research
related
thereto
.

There
are
authorized
to
be
appropriated
such
sums

this
Act
during
the
fiscal
years
1962
to
1967
,

)

The
Secretary
of
the
Interior
or
any
duly
authorized
representative
shall
be
entitled
to
admission
to
,
and
to
require
reports
from

)
,
the
products
of
which
regularly
enter
commerce
or
the
operations
of
which
substantially
affect
commerce
,
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
data
and
information
necessary
for
the
study
authorized
in
the
first
section
of
this
Act
.

and
(

)

the
maximum
amount
of
such
payments
which
may
be
made
on
account
of
such
sales
made
during
the
calendar
year
1964
shall
not
exceed
$4,000,000
;
;

and
the
maximum
amount
of
such
payments
which
may
be
made
on
account
of
such
sales
made
during
the
calendar
year
1965
shall
not
exceed
$3,500,000
.

In
the
same
period
,
431
presentations
by
members
of
the
staff
were
made
to
local
,
national
,
and
international
medical
groups
.

The
education
function
of
the
Institute
is
carried
on
by
the
staff
in
the
departments
of
pathology
and
its
consultants
.

During
fiscal
year
1960
,
seven
courses
were
conducted
:
Application
of
Histochemistry
to
Pathology
,
Forensic
Pathology
,
Pathology
of
Diseases
of
Laboratory
Animals
,
Pathology
of
the
Oral
Regions
,
Ophthalmic
Pathology
,
Forensic
Sciences
Symposium
,
and
Orthopedic
Pathology
.

During
fiscal
years
1959
and
1960
,
there
were
139
military
and
civilian
students
who
came
to
the
Institute
for
varying
periods
of
special
instruction
.

Among
the
specific
areas
of
concentration
in
which
the
staff
is
engaged
,
are
such
projects
as
biological
and
biochemical
studies
of
the
effects
of
microwaves
;
;

Also
,
the
Defense
Atomic
Support
Agency
sponsored
a
long-range
study
at
this
Institute
on
the
response
of
massive
suspension
cultures
of
mammalian
cells
to
acute
radiation
.

Other
scientific
agencies
,
both
Federal
and
civilian
,
supported
studies
in
quantitative
electron
microscopical
approach
to
microchemistry
and
microcytochemistry
;
;

In
addition
to
maintaining
a
permanent
central
file
of
illustrations
of
diseases
,
wounds
,
and
injuries
of
military
importance
,
it
provides
facilities
for
clinical
photography
,
photomicrography
,
and
medical
arts
,
and
operates
a
printing
plant
,
by
permission
of
Congressional
Committee
,
for
publication
of
an
Atlas
of
Tumor
Pathology
.

Demonstrations
of
new
and
projected
training
aids
were
conducted
at
the
Medical
Service
Instructor's
Conference
,
Brooke
Army
Medical
Center
,
Texas
.

Fifty
lantern
slide
teaching
sets
on
the
subject
of
Emergency
War
Surgery
(
NATO
)
were
assembled
and
distributed
to
the
Medical
Military
Services
of
foreign
Governments
associated
with
NATO
and
South-East
Asia
Treaty
Organization
.

The
American
Registry
Of
Pathology
operates
as
a
cooperative
enterprise
in
medical
research
and
education
between
the
Armed
Forces
Institute
of
Pathology
and
the
civilian
medical
profession
on
a
national
and
international
basis
,
under
such
conditions
as
may
be
agreed
upon
between
the
National
Research
Council
and
The
Surgeons
General
of
the
Army
,
Navy
,
and
Air
Force
.

There
were
54,320
copies
of
fascicles
sold
and
642
copies
distributed
free
during
this
period
.

Forty-five
new
Clinico-pathologic
Conferences
were
prepared
,
bringing
the
total
to
61
available
for
loan
distribution
.

During
this
period
,
7,827
teaching
sets
were
distributed
on
loan
.

The
demand
for
teaching
sets
continues
unabated
since
they
provide
the
means
for
the
military
physicians
to
review
the
pathology
of
selected
disease
processes
or
organ
systems
for
review
of
basic
sciences
and
correlation
of
clinical
physiological
behavior
with
structural
changes
.

Three
hundred
five
copies
of
the
Manual
Of
Macropathological
Techniques
were
distributed
.

Its
supplement
,
The
Medical
Technicians
Bulletin
,
supplied
similar
material
to
enlisted
medical
personnel
.

In
addition
,
their
establishment
made
it
unnecessary
to
begin
publication
of
a
contemplated
Air
Force
medical
bulletin
.

Estimated
annual
savings
resulting
from
publication
of
the
Journal
and
Bulletin
on
a
triservice
basis
,
as
compared
with
the
cost
of
producing
separate
periodicals
for
each
service
,
were
between
$65,000
and
$70,000
.

Beginning
with
the
October
1959
issue
of
the
Journal
,
the
method
of
production
of
copy
for
photo-offset
reproduction
was
changed
from
varityping
to
hot
typesetting
.

The
development
and
testing
of
new
apparatus
to
measure
other
properties
is
nearing
completion
.

The
element
is
inserted
in
the
discharge
circuit
in
place
of
the
exploding
wire
,
and
the
calorimetric
heating
of
the
element
is
measured
with
high
accuracy
.

This
is
used
as
a
reference
for
comparing
the
ohmic
heating
and
the
electrical
energy
obtained
from
the
measured
current
through
the
element
and
the
measured
voltage
across
the
element
.

A
high-speed
shutter
has
been
developed
in
order
to
permit
photographic
observation
of
any
portion
of
the
electrical
wire
explosion
.

The
shutter
consists
of
two
parts
:
a
fast-opening
part
and
a
fast-closing
part
.

Using
Edgerton's
method
,
the
fast-closing
action
is
obtained
from
the
blackening
of
a
window
by
exploding
a
series
of
parallel
lead
wires
.

The
opening
action
is
obtained
when
a
capacitor
,
charged
to
high
voltage
,
is
suddenly
discharged
through
the
foil
.

The
detection
and
study
of
such
line
spectra
would
add
considerably
to
present
information
on
interstellar
gas
clouds
and
,
perhaps
,
planetary
atmospheres
.

Among
the
most
likely
producers
of
detectable
radio
line
spectra
are
the
light
diatomic
hydrides
OH
and
CH
;
;

in
interstellar
gas
,
concentrations
as
low
as
Af
molecules
per
Af
may
be
sufficient
,
as
compared
to
the
Af
hydrogen
atom's
Af
required
for
detection
of
the
21-cm
line
.

therefore
,
only
with
precise
foreknowledge
of
the
line
frequencies
is
an
astronomical
search
for
the
radio
spectra
of
these
molecules
feasible
.

This
involves
the
application
of
a
strong
magnetic
field
to
the
radical
vapor
,
which
shifts
the
low-frequency
spectra
to
a
conveniently
high
microwave
range
,
where
they
may
be
measured
with
optimum
sensitivity
.

Success
in
observing
these
spectral
lines
has
so
far
,
apparently
,
been
confined
to
the
laboratory
;
;

Preparations
are
being
made
for
similar
experiments
on
CH
and
SH
radicals
.

The
efforts
and
accomplishments
fall
into
three
main
categories
:
absolute
thermometry
based
upon
the
velocity
of
sound
in
helium
gas
,
secondary
thermometry
involving
principally
studies
of
the
behavior
of
germanium
resistors
,
and
helium-4
vapor-pressure
measurements
(
see
p.
144
)
.

Such
an
interferometer
provides
a
means
of
absolute
temperature
measurement
,
and
may
be
used
as
an
alternative
to
the
gas
thermometer
.

Carbon
resistors
and
impurity-doped
germanium
resistors
have
been
investigated
for
use
as
precision
secondary
thermometers
in
the
liquid
helium
temperature
region
.

The
estimated
standard
deviations
of
the
data
for
two
of
the
resistors
were
1
millidegree
;
;

The
gradient
was
about
one
half
of
a
millidegree
at
4.2
Af
but
increased
to
several
millidegrees
for
bath
temperatures
slightly
greater
than
the
**yl
point
.

However
,
the
surface
temperature
gradient
can
produce
erroneous
vapor-pressure
measurements
for
the
bulk
liquid
helium
unless
precautions
are
taken
to
isolate
the
tube
(
which
passes
through
the
surface
to
the
vapor
pressure
bulb
)
from
the
liquid
helium
surface
.

It
has
also
been
observed
,
in
helium
2
,
that
large
discrepancies
can
exist
between
surface
vapor
pressures
and
those
pressures
measured
by
a
vapor
pressure
thermometer
.

This
project
was
carried
out
under
sponsorship
of
the
Ballistic
Missile
Division
of
the
Air
Research
and
Development
Command
,
U.S.
Air
Force

to
subsection
(
A
)
of
this
section
any
amounts
hereafter

in

which
has

Government

United

as
described
in
subsection
(
A
)
of
Section
4
of
this
Title
.

Mr.
Speaker
,
for
several
years
now
the
commuter
railroads
serving
our
large
metropolitan
areas
have
found
it
increasingly
difficult
to
render
the
kind
of
service
our
expanding
population
wants
and
is
entitled
to
have
.

The
causes
of
the
decline
of
the
commuter
railroads
are
many
and
complex
--
high
taxes
,
losses
of
revenue
to
Government
subsidized
highway
and
air
carriers
,
to
name
but
two
.

Not
only
is
this
kind
of
duplication
wasteful
,
but
it
gives
the
combined
system
the
ability
to
take
freight
traffic
away
from
the
New
York
Central
and
other
railroads
serving
the
area
.

This
is
a
$14
million
operation
involving
3,500
employees
who
work
on
commuter
traffic
exclusively
.

There
is
a
workable
alternative
to
this
potentially
dangerous
and
harmful
C.
&
O.
-
B.
&
O.
merger
scheme
--

Detailed
studies
of
the
plan
were
well
underway
.

Then
,
abandoning
the
studies
in
the
face
of
their
promising
outlook
for
all
concerned
,
B.
&
O.
entered
on-again-off-again
negotiations
with
C.
&
O.
which
resulted
in
the
present
situation
.

However
,
there
is
a
more
profound
consideration
to
this
proposed
merger
than
profit
and
loss
.

That
is
,
will
it
serve
the
long-range
public
interest
?
?

For
the
past
40
years
Congress
has
advocated
a
carefully
planned
,
balanced
and
competitive
railway
system
.

Once
the
full
extent
of
this
Russian
military
penetration
of
Cuba
was
clear
,
President
Kennedy
announced
we
would
take
whatever
action
was
appropriate
to
prevent
this
,
even
if
we
had
to
go
it
alone
.

efforts
,
as
I
see
it
,
which
are
being
directed
,
by
the
way
,
toward
support
for
future
actions
,
not
for
those
already
past
.

What
the
next
move
will
be
only
time
,
of
course
,
will
tell
.

Look
at
Castro
now
--
cockier
than
ever
with
arms
and
agents
to
threaten
the
Americas
.

Blockade
is
one
answer
offered
by
experts
.

In
it
they
see
a
way
to
isolate
Cuba
,
stop
infiltration
,
maybe
finish
Castro
,
too
.

It
could
halt
a
flood
of
Communist
arms
and
strategic
supplies
now
reaching
Castro
.

To
round
out
the
blockading
force
,
submarines
would
be
needed
--
to
locate
,
identify
and
track
approaching
vessels
.

the
blockading
force
must
be
powerful
enough
to
enforce
it
;
;

From
its
inception
in
1920
with
the
passage
of
Public
Law
236
,
66th
Congress
,
the
purpose
of
the
vocational
rehabilitation
program
has
been
to
assist
the
States
,
by
means
of
grants-in-aid
,
to
return
disabled
men
and
women
to
productive
,
gainful
employment
.

The
1954
Amendments
completely
changed
the
financing
of
the
vocational
rehabilitation
program
,
providing
for
a
three-part
grant
structure
--
for
(

)
basic
support
;
;

(
See
Source
of
Data
,
below
for
per
capita
income
data
to
be
used
in
this
step
.

Determine
the
ratio
of
50%
to
the
average
per
capita
income
of
the
U.
S.
(
Divide
50
by
the
result
obtained
in
item
2
above
.

By
law
this
is
75%
for
the
Virgin
Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto
Rico
.

(
Alaska
and
Hawaii
had
fixed
allotment
percentages
in
effect
prior
to
fiscal
year
1962
.

In
all
other
States
it
is
the
difference
obtained
by
subtracting
from
100
the
result
obtained
in
item
4
above
;
;

If
the
resulting
difference
for
the
particular
State
is
less
or
more
than
these
extremes
,
the
State's
allotment
percentage
must
be
raised
or
lowered
to
the
appropriate
extreme
.

(
Multiply
result
obtained
in
item
7
above
,
by
result
obtained
in
item
6
above
.

Determine
the
ratio
that
the
amount
being
allotted
is
to
the
sum
of
the
products
for
all
the
States
.

Determine
if
the
particular
State's
unadjusted
allotment
(
result
obtained
in
item
11
above
)
is
less
than
its
minimum
(
base
)
allotment
,
and
if
so
raise
its
unadjusted
allotment
to
its
minimum
allotment
.

For
the
States
which
maintain
two
separate
agencies
--
one
for
the
vocational
rehabilitation
of
the
blind
,
and
one
for
the
rehabilitation
of
persons
other
than
the
blind
--
the
Act
specifies
that
their
minimum
(
base
)
allotment
shall
be
divided
between
the
two
agencies
in
the
same
proportion
as
it
was
divided
in
fiscal
year
1954
.

Funds
allotted
in
addition
to
their
minimum
allotment
are
apportioned
to
the
two
agencies
as
they
may
determine
.

For
purposes
of
this
explanation
,
this
percentage
is
referred
to
as
the
State's
unadjusted
Federal
share
.

The
purpose
of
the
adjusted
Federal
share
relating
to
the
base
allotment
and
of
the
transition
provisions
for
reaching
the
unadjusted
Federal
share
is
to
prevent
dislocations
from
abrupt
changes
in
matching
rates
.

The
method
used
for
computing
the
respective
Federal
and
State
shares
in
total
program
costs
is
specifically
set
forth
in
the
Act
.

(
Divide
40
by
the
amount
used
in
item
2
above
.

By
law
this
is
70%
for
the
Virgin
Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto
Rico
.

In
all
other
States
it
is
the
difference
obtained
by
subtracting
from
100
the
result
obtained
in
item
4
above
;
;

The
outside
4-inch
space
is
filled
by
mortaring
blocks
on
edge
.

Concrete
blocks
are
passed
between
the
beams
and
put
on
the
boards
.

Work
on
the
roof
continues
in
this
way
.

The
last
roof
boards
are
covered
with
blocks
from
outside
the
shelter
.

When
the
roof
blocks
are
all
in
place
,
the
final
rows
of
wall
blocks
are
mortared
into
position
.

If
they
are
used
,
the
walls
and
roof
should
be
10
inches
thick
to
give
the
same
protection
as
the
8-inch
solid
concrete
blocks
.

The
materials
for
a
double-wall
shelter
would
cost
about
$700
.

The
illustration
(
fig.
11
)
shows
this
shelter
with
the
roof
at
ground
level
and
mounded
over
.

Some
will
go
around
a
corner
.

A
blower
may
be
installed
to
increase
comfort
.

Lighting
is
an
important
consideration
.

There
should
be
a
regular
electrical
outlet
in
the
shelter
as
power
may
continue
in
many
areas
.

Basement
walls
that
project
above
the
ground
should
be
shielded
as
shown
in
the
Appendix
,
page
29
.

Living
in
a
shelter

Forty-nine
hours
after
an
atomic
burst
the
radiation
intensity
is
only
about
1
percent
of
what
it
was
an
hour
after
the
explosion
.

Radiation
instruments
suitable
for
home
use
are
available
,
and
would
be
of
value
in
locating
that
portion
of
the
home
which
offers
the
best
protection
against
fallout
radiation
.

Part
of
the
family
should
be
sleeping
while
the
rest
is
awake
.

Food
,
medical
supplies
,
utensils
,
and
equipment
,
if
not
already
stored
in
the
shelter
,
must
be
quickly
gathered
up
and
carried
into
it
.

It
would
take
the
chill
from
the
shelter
in
the
beginning
.

Warm
clothing
and
bedding
,
of
course
,
are
essential
.

The
best
protection
would
be
on
the
ground
floor
in
the
central
part
of
the
house
.

If
there
is
time
after
the
warning
,
the
basement
shielding
could
be
improved
substantially
by
blocking
windows
with
bricks
,
dirt
,
books
,
magazines
,
or
other
heavy
material
.

Large
apartment
buildings
of
masonry
or
concrete
provide
better
natural
shelter
than
the
usual
family
dwellings
.

In
general
,
such
apartments
afford
more
protection
than
smaller
buildings
because
their
walls
are
thick
and
there
is
more
space
.

Section
7
is
designed
to
arrest
in
its
incipiency
not
only
the
substantial
lessening
of
competition
from
the
acquisition
by
one
corporation
of
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
stock
of
a
competing
corporation
,
but
also
to
arrest
in
their
incipiency
restraints
or
monopolies
in
a
relevant
market
which
,
as
a
reasonable
probability
,
appear
at
the
time
of
suit
likely
to
result
from
the
acquisition
by
one
corporation
of
all
or
any
part
of
the
stock
of
any
other
corporation
.

that
these
products
constituted
a
line
of
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
Clayton
Act
;
;

and
that
competition
for
this
share
of
the
market
was
endangered
by
the
financial
relationship
between
the
two
concerns
:

On
the
basis
of
the
findings
which
led
to
this
conclusion
,
the
Court
remanded
the
case
to
the
District
Court
to
determine
the
appropriate
relief
.

The
sole
guidance
given
the
Court
for
discharging
the
task
committed
to
it
was
this
:

The
District
Courts
,
in
the
framing
of
equitable
decrees
,
are
clothed
'
with
large
discretion
to
model
their
judgements
to
fit
the
exigencies
of
the
particular
case
.

International
Salt
Co.
v.
United
States
,
332
U.
S.
392
,
400-401
.

No
previous
antitrust
case
,
he
said
,
had
involved
interests
of
such
magnitude
or
presented
such
complex
problems
of
relief
.

In
the
case
of
taxpaying
corporate
stockholders
,
the
measure
would
be
the
lesser
of
the
fair
market
value
of
the
shares
or
Du
Pont's
tax
basis
for
them
,
which
is
approximately
$2.09
per
share
.

Under
its
plan
Du
Pont
would
retain
its
General
Motors
shares
but
be
required
to
pass
on
to
its
stockholders
the
right
to
vote
those
shares
.

General
Motors
comprehensively
contended
that
the
Government
plan
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
as
required
by
the
mandate
of
this
Court
.

The
decrees
proposed
by
the
amici
curiae
were
filed
in
August
of
1958
.

While
it
is
easy
enough
to
ridicule
Hawkins'
pronouncement
in
Pleas
Of
The
Crown
from
a
metaphysical
point
of
view
,
the
concept
of
the
oneness
of
a
married
couple
may
reflect
an
abiding
belief
that
the
communion
between
husband
and
wife
is
such
that
their
actions
are
not
always
to
be
regarded
by
the
criminal
law
as
if
there
were
no
marriage
.

I
am
not
easily
persuaded
that
a
rule
accepted
by
so
many
people
for
so
many
centuries
can
be
so
lightly
dismissed
.

petitioner
was
not
denied
due
process
;
;

Petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
have
the
hearing
officer's
notes
and
report
,
especially
since
he
failed
to
show
any
particular
need
for
them
and
he
did
have
a
copy
of
the
Department
of
Justice's
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board
.

On
the
brief
were
Solicitor
General
Rankin
,
Assistant
Attorney
General
Wilkey
,
Beatrice
Rosenberg
and
J.
F.
Bishop
.

He
says
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
rebut
before
the
hearing
officer
statements
attributed
to
him
by
the
local
board
,
and
,
further
,
that
he
was
denied
at
trial
the
right
to
have
the
Department
of
Justice
hearing
officer's
report
and
the
original
report
of
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
as
to
his
claim
--
all
in
violation
of
the
Fifth
Amendment
.

F.
2d

.

that
he
was
devoting
an
average
of
100
hours
a
month
to
actual
preaching
publicly
,
in
addition
to
50
to
75
hours
in
other
ministerial
duties
,
and
that
he
opposed
war
in
any
form
.

Upon
administrative
approval
of
the
reclassification
,
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
on
June
11
,
1956
,
but
failed
to
do
so
.

But
the
statement
of
the
local
board
attributing
this
claim
to
petitioner
was
in
his
file
.

At
his
trial
,
petitioner
sought
to
secure
through
subpoena
duces
tecum
the
longhand
notes
of
the
Department's
hearing
officer
,
Evensen
,
as
well
as
his
report
thereon
.

Moreover
,
the
hearing
officer's
report
is
but
intradepartmental
,
is
directed
to
the
Attorney
General
and
,
of
course
,
is
not
the
recommendation
of
the
Department
.

In
the
light
of
these
circumstances
,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
the
issue
at
trial
in
this
respect
centered
entirely
on
the
Department's
recommendation
,
which
petitioner
repudiated
but
which
both
the
appeal
board
and
the
courts
below
found
supported
by
the
record
,
we
find
no
relevancy
in
the
hearing
officer's
report
and
notes
.

There
we
held
that
the
statutory
scheme
for
review
,
within
the
selective
service
system
,
entitles
[
conscientious
objectors
]
to
no
guarantee
that
the
FBI
reports
must
be
produced
for
their
inspection

help
but
be
a
planning
officer
.

We
want
to
make
sure
that
our
junior
colleagues
realize
that
ideas
are
welcome
,
that
initiative
goes
right
down
to
the
bottom
and
goes
all
the
way
to
the
top
.

The
responsibility
for
taking
the
initiative
in
generating
ideas
is
that
of
every
officer
in
the
Department
who
has
a
policy
function
,
regardless
of
rank
.

Sometimes
those
who
know
about
them
are
too
far
down
the
line
to
be
able
to
do
anything
about
them
.

This
does
not
mean
in
a
purely
bureaucratic
sense
but
in
an
active
,
operational
,
interested
,
responsible
fashion
.

If
any
official
operation
abroad
begins
to
go
wrong
,
we
shall
look
to
the
ambassador
to
find
out
why
and
to
get
suggestions
for
remedial
action
.

It
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
be
interested
in
some
thoughts
which
I
expressed
privately
in
recent
years
,
in
the
hope
of
clearing
up
a
certain
confusion
in
the
public
mind
about
what
foreign
policy
is
all
about
and
what
it
means
,
and
of
developing
a
certain
compassion
for
those
who
are
carrying
such
responsibilities
inside
Government
.

For
he
knows
that
the
first
and
sometimes
most
difficult
job
is
to
know
what
the
question
is
--
that
when
it
is
accurately
identified
it
sometimes
answers
itself
,
and
that
the
way
in
which
it
is
posed
frequently
shapes
the
answer
.

Chewing
it
over
with
his
colleagues
and
in
his
own
mind
,
he
reaches
a
tentative
identification
of
the
question
--
tentative
because
it
may
change
as
he
explores
it
further
and
because
,
if
no
tolerable
answer
can
be
found
,
it
may
have
to
be
changed
into
one
which
can
be
answered
.

He
is
appreciative
of
the
expert
help
available
to
him
and
draws
these
resources
into
play
,
taking
care
to
examine
at
least
some
of
the
raw
material
which
underlies
their
frequently
policy-oriented
conclusions
.

He
must
think
about
which
of
these
principles
must
take
precedence
.

Who
should
be
consulted
among
his
colleagues
in
the
Department
or
other
departments
and
agencies
of
the
Government
?
?

If
we
sit
here
reading
editorials
and
looking
at
public-opinion
polls
and
other
reports
that
cross
our
desks
,
we
should
realize
that
this
is
raw
,
undigested
opinion
expressed
in
the
absence
of
leadership
.

And
the
policy
officer
has
the
hounds
of
time
snapping
at
his
heels
.

There
should
be
no
draft
exemption
because
of
Peace
Corps
service
.

Peace
Corps
volunteers
obviously
should
not
be
paid
what
they
might
earn
in
comparable
activities
in
the
United
States
.

When
the
aid
operations
are
reorganized
the
Peace
Corps
should
remain
a
semi-autonomous
,
functional
unit
.

What
would
the
first
projects
be
?
?

Unfriendly
political
groups
will
no
doubt
do
everything
in
their
power
to
promote
active
hostility
.

But
there
are
indications
that
many
developing
nations
will
welcome
Peace
Corps
volunteers
,
and
that
if
the
volunteers
are
well
chosen
,
they
will
soon
demonstrate
their
value
and
make
many
friends
.

For
this
must
be
the
project
of
the
whole
American
people
.

Is
it
worth
the
cost
and
the
risks
?
?

With
colleges
and
universities
carrying
a
large
part
of
the
program
,
and
with
students
looking
toward
Peace
Corps
service
,
there
will
be
an
impact
on
educational
curriculum
and
student
seriousness
.

The
temporary
Peace
Corps
will
be
a
source
of
information
and
experience
to
aid
us
in
formulating
more
effective
plans
for
a
permanent
organization
.

This
temporary
Peace
Corps
is
being
established
under
existing
authority
in
the
Mutual
Security
Act
and
will
be
located
in
the
Department
of
State
.

One
of
the
greatest
obstacles
to
the
achievement
of
this
goal
is
the
lack
of
trained
men
and
women
with
the
skill
to
teach
the
young
and
assist
in
the
operation
of
development
projects
--
men
and
women
with
the
capacity
to
cope
with
the
demands
of
swiftly
evolving
economics
,
and
with
the
dedication
to
put
that
capacity
to
work
in
the
villages
,
the
mountains
,
the
towns
and
the
factories
of
dozens
of
struggling
nations
.

If
it
were
not
for
the
effect
of
destructive
agencies
,
sawtimber
growth
would
have
been
nearly
twice
as
great
as
the
47
billion
board
feet
in
1952
.

These
destructive
forces
also
have
a
seriously
adverse
effect
upon
the
watersheds
and
their
life-supporting
waterflows
,
and
upon
the
other
renewable
forest
resources
.

This
will
require
about
a
40
percent
increase
over
the
present
level
of
protection
.

Coordination
of
pest
control
objectives
with
timber
management
activities
to
reduce
losses
.

This
will
include
125
million
acres
compared
with
23
million
acres
now
receiving
such
protection
.

An
additional
15
million
acres
will
be
given
a
lesser
degree
of
protection
but
adequate
to
meet
the
average
fire
situation
.

This
will
include
a
stepped-up
program
of
training
and
development
of
personnel
.

Protection
from
other
damage

These
areas
comprise
about
half
of
the
total
area
of
rodent
infestation
on
the
National
Forests
.

This
system
is
divided
into
a
forest
highway
system
,
administered
by
the
Secretary
of
Commerce
,
and
a
forest
development
road
and
trail
system
,
administered
by
the
Secretary
of
Agriculture
.

These
roads
are
largely
of
less
than
highway
standards
,
and
usually
carry
traffic
which
is
related
to
use
of
the
National
Forests
.

The
ultimate
trail
system
will
be
of
value
primarily
for
recreation
and
wildlife
utilization
and
fire
protection
.

It
will
be
carefully
planned
to
maintain
optimum
service
to
these
important
resources
and
watersheds
.

The
presence
or
lack
of
access
by
road
or
trail
has
a
direct
and
controlling
influence
on
all
phases
of
forest
management
and
utilization
such
as
:
(
A
)

Service
at
these
levels
of
production
and
utilization
will
eventually
require
the
construction
of
about
379,900
miles
of
new
roads
and
6,000
miles
of
new
trails
,
along
with
the
reconstruction
to
higher
standards
of
about
105,000
miles
of
roads
and
10,500
miles
of
trails
.

Approximately
40
percent
of
the
value
of
the
work
on
roads
for
access
to
timber
which
are
planned
for
this
period
will
be
constructed
by
purchasers
of
National
Forest
timber
,
but
paid
for
by
the
Government
through
adjustment
of
stumpage
prices
.

And
some
,
which
are
suitable
for
tree
growing
and
for
other
National
Forest
purposes
,
are
unmanaged
or
in
need
of
expensive
rehabilitation
,
and
are
contributing
nothing
to
the
economy
;
;

there
are
no
reasonable
prospects
that
these
conditions
will
be
corrected
or
changed
.

I
have
requested
the
Secretary
of
Defense
to
reexamine
the
roles
and
missions
of
the
reserve
components
in
relation
to
those
of
the
active
forces
and
in
the
light
of
the
changing
requirements
of
modern
warfare
.

These
strengths
are
considered
adequate
to
meet
the
essential
roles
and
missions
of
the
reserves
in
support
of
our
national
security
objectives
.

Retired
pay
costs
are
increased
by
$94
million
in
1961
over
1960
,
partly
because
of
a
substantial
increase
in
the
number
of
retired
personnel
.

Traditionally
,
rates
of
pay
for
retired
military
personnel
have
been
proportionate
to
current
rates
of
pay
for
active
personnel
.

The
increase
stems
largely
from
the
growing
complexity
of
and
higher
degree
of
maintenance
required
for
newer
weapons
and
equipment
.

In
the
budget
message
for
1959
,
and
again
for
1960
,
I
recommended
immediate
repeal
of
section
601
of
the
Act
of
September
28
,
1951
(
65
Stat.
365
)
.

Procurement
,
research
,
and
construction
.

These
contrasting
trends
in
procurement
reflect
the
anticipated
changes
in
the
composition
and
missions
of
our
Armed
Forces
in
the
years
ahead
.

The
task
of
providing
a
reasonable
level
of
military
strength
,
without
endangering
other
vital
aspects
of
our
security
,
is
greatly
complicated
by
the
swift
pace
of
scientific
progress
.

Thus
,
in
the
last
few
years
,
a
number
of
programs
which
looked
very
promising
at
the
time
their
development
was
commenced
have
since
been
completely
eliminated
.

For
example
,
the
importance
of
the
Regulus
2
,
a
very
promising
aerodynamic
ship-to-surface
missile
designed
to
be
launched
by
surfaced
submarines
,
was
greatly
diminished
by
the
successful
acceleration
of
the
much
more
advanced
Polaris
ballistic
missile
launched
by
submerged
submarines
.

Another
example
is
the
recent
cancellation
of
the
F-108
,
a
long-range
interceptor
with
a
speed
three
times
as
great
as
the
speed
of
sound
,
which
was
designed
for
use
against
manned
bombers
in
the
period
of
the
mid-1960's
.

The
impact
of
technological
factors
is
also
illustrated
by
the
history
of
the
high-energy
fuel
program
.

This
project
was
started
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
critical
need
for
a
high-energy
fuel
to
provide
an
extra
margin
of
range
for
high
performance
aircraft
,
particularly
our
heavy
bombers
.

The
second
capability
is
represented
by
our
deployed
ground
,
naval
,
and
air
forces
in
essential
forward
areas
,
together
with
ready
reserves
capable
of
effecting
early
emergency
reinforcement
.

The
Strategic
Air
Command
is
the
principal
element
of
our
long-range
nuclear
capability
.

However
,
I
am
recommending
that
development
work
on
the
B-70
air-frame
and
engines
be
continued
.

These
additional
modern
bombers
will
replace
some
of
the
older
B-47
medium
bombers
;
;

The
United
States
recognizes
the
desire
of
India
to
accumulate
,
as
quickly
as
possible
,
a
substantial
part
of
the
one
million
ton
reserve
stock
of
rice
provided
for
in
this
Agreement
to
assist
in
stabilizing
the
internal
markets
for
this
commodity
in
India
.

The
United
States
Government
shall
have
the
right
to
terminate
the
financing
of
further
sales
under
this
Agreement
of
any
commodity
if
it
determines
at
any
time
after
June
30
,
1961
,
that
such
action
is
necessitated
by
the
existence
of
an
international
emergency
.

Article
3
,
deposit
of
rupees

The
two
Governments
agree
that
they
will
take
reasonable
precautions
to
assure
that
all
sales
or
purchases
of
surplus
agricultural
commodities
,
pursuant
to
the
Agreement
will
not
displace
usual
marketings
of
the
United
States
of
America
in
these
commodities
,
or
unduly
disrupt
world
prices
of
agricultural
commodities
or
normal
patterns
of
commercial
trade
with
friendly
countries
.

In
witness
whereof
,
the
respective
representatives
,
duly
authorized
for
the
purpose
,
have
signed
the
present
Agreement
.

The
Government
of
the
United
States
of
America
may
utilize
rupees
in
India
to
pay
for
goods
and
services
,
including
international
transportation
needed
in
connection
with
market
development
and
other
agricultural
projects
and
activities
in
India
and
other
countries
.

In
the
event
the
rupees
set
aside
for
loans
under
Section
104
(
E
)
of
the
Act
are
not
advanced
within
six
years
from
the
date
of
this
Agreement
because
the
Export-Import
Bank
of
Washington
has
not
approved
loans
or
because
proposed
loans
have
not
been
mutually
agreeable
to
the
Export-Import
Bank
of
Washington
and
the
Department
of
Economic
Affairs
of
the
Government
of
India
,
the
Government
of
the
United
States
of
America
may
use
the
rupees
for
any
purpose
authorized
by
Section
104
of
the
Act
.

When
the
Export-Import
Bank
is
prepared
to
act
favorably
upon
an
application
,
it
will
so
notify
the
Department
of
Economic
Affairs
and
will
indicate
the
interest
rate
and
the
repayment
period
which
would
be
used
under
the
proposed
loan
.

The
interest
rate
will
be
similar
to
those
prevailing
in
India
on
comparable
loans
and
the
maturities
will
be
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
financing
.

Within
sixty
days
after
the
receipt
of
notice
that
the
Export-Import
Bank
is
prepared
to
act
favorably
upon
an
application
the
Department
of
Economic
Affairs
will
indicate
to
the
Export-Import
Bank
whether
or
not
the
Department
of
Economic
Affairs
has
any
objection
to
the
proposed
loan
.

Other
economic
development
projects
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
Sections
104
(
E
)
and
104
(
G
)
of
the
Act
.

It
is
agreed
that
any
goods
delivered
or
services
rendered
after
the
date
of
this
agreement
for
projects
within
categories
A
,
B
,
and
C
under
paragraph
2
above
which
may
later
be
approved
by
the
United
States
will
be
eligible
for
financing
from
currency
granted
or
loaned
to
the
Government
of
India
.

Local
currency
will
be
advanced
or
reimbursed
to
the
Government
of
India
for
financing
agreed
projects
under
paragraphs
1
(
B
)
and
1
(
C
)
of
Article
2
,
of
the
Agreement
upon
the
presentation
of
such
documentation
as
the
United
States
may
specify
.

The
Government
of
India
shall
maintain
or
cause
to
be
maintained
books
and
records
adequate
to
identify
the
goods
and
services
financed
for
agreed
projects
pursuant
to
paragraphs
1
(
B
)
and
1
(
C
)
of
Article
2
,
of
the
Agreement
,
to
disclose
the
use
thereof
in
the
projects
and
to
record
the
progress
of
the
projects
(
including
the
cost
thereof
)
.

By
this
standard
,
it
is
determined
that
where
two
stations
operating
on
the
same
frequency
are
involved
,
objectionable
interference
from
station
A
exists
at
any
point
within
the
service
area
of
station
B
where
station
A's
signal
is
of
an
intensity
one-twentieth
or
more
of
the
strength
of
station
B's
signal
at
that
point
.

A
second
fundamental
principle
is
that
involved
particularly
in
the
present
proceeding
--
the
difference
between
nighttime
and
daytime
propagation
conditions
with
respect
to
the
standard
broadcast
frequencies
.

But
during
nighttime
hours
the
skywave
radiations
are
reflected
from
the
ionosphere
,
thereby
creating
the
possibility
of
one
station's
rendering
service
,
via
skywave
,
at
a
much
greater
distance
than
it
can
through
its
groundwave
signal
,
and
at
the
same
time
vastly
complicating
the
interference
problem
because
of
the
still
greater
distance
over
which
these
skywave
signals
may
cause
interference
to
the
signals
of
stations
on
the
same
and
closely
adjacent
frequencies
.

during
the
same
period
around
sunrise
,
skywave
transmission
is
declining
,
until
at
about
2
hours
after
sunrise
it
reaches
a
point
where
it
becomes
of
little
practical
significance
.

Accordingly
,
the
1938-39
rules
adopted
these
hours
as
limitations
upon
the
operation
of
daytime
stations
.

With
respect
to
nighttime
assignments
,
the
degree
of
skywave
service
and
interference
is
determined
by
skywave
curves
(
figs.
1
and
2
of
sec.
3.190
of
the
rules
)
giving
average
skywave
values
.

In
dealing
with
these
frequencies
,
the
objective
listed
first
above
--
provision
of
service
to
all
listeners
--
was
predominant
;
;

But
nighttime
operation
by
stations
of
other
classes
of
course
entails
skywave
interference
to
groundwave
service
,
interference
which
is
substantial
unless
steps
are
taken
to
minimize
it
.

With
respect
to
other
frequencies
,
these
are
designated
as
regional
or
local
,
and
assigned
for
use
by
class
3
,
and
class
4
,
stations
,
respectively
,
stations
operating
generally
with
lower
power
.

In
the
allocation
pattern
worked
out
for
these
frequencies
,
the
provision
of
long-range
service
has
to
some
extent
been
subordinated
to
the
other
two
objectives
--
assignment
of
multiple
facilities
,
and
assignment
of
stations
in
as
many
communities
as
possible
.

During
nighttime
hours
,
because
of
the
intense
skywave
propagation
then
prevailing
,
no
large
number
of
stations
can
be
permitted
to
operate
on
one
of
these
channels
,
if
the
wide
area
service
for
which
these
frequencies
are
assigned
is
to
be
rendered
satisfactorily
by
the
dominant
stations
which
must
be
relied
upon
to
render
it
.

April
15
is
usually
the
final
date
for
filing
income
tax
returns
for
most
people
because
they
use
the
calendar
year
ending
on

The
one-
or
two-season
hunt
,
of
which
there
have
been
too
many
recently
,
may
do
more
harm
than
good
;
;

The
central
group
of
the
Foundation's
advisors
are
,
at
any
one
period
of
time
,
the
members
of
our
Advisory
Board
,
consisting
,
now
,
of
thirty-six
men
and
women
.

That
we
had
the
wit
and
wisdom
to
adopt
Mr.
Lowell's
concept
and
make
it
the
base
for
our
processes
of
selection
is
one
reason
why
our
selections
have
been
,
it
may
be
said
truly
,
pretty
uniformly
good
.

And
lest
we
should
become
too
consistent
,
in
the
sense
of
becoming
heedless
of
new
fields
of
scholarship
and
new
points
of
view
in
the
arts
,
the
Foundation's
Board
of
Trustees
maintains
a
trickle
--
not
a
flow
!
!

For
example
,
the
interest
of
past
members
of
the
Foundation's
Advisory
Board
remains
such
that
they
place
their
knowledge
and
judgments
at
our
disposal
much
as
they
had
done
when
they
were
,
formally
,
members
of
that
Board
.

To
all
,
the
Foundation
gives
the
kind
of
thanks
which
are
more
than
thanks
:
to
them
we
are
grateful
beyond
the
possibility
of
conveying
in
words
how
grateful
we
are
.

Keats's
words
--
in
the
days
of
the
Spanish
Armada's
threats
;
;

For
example
,
out
of
the
social
evils
of
the
English
industrial
revolution
came
the
novels
of
Charles
Dickens
;
;

Some
would
say
that
they
were
not
permitted
to
run
their
businesses
only
for
profit
;
;

the
greater
the
range
of
choice
,
the
greater
the
rate
of
change
.

For
change
is
dependent
on
the
possibilities
that
individual
men
glimpse
for
the
future
.

in
1960
,
we
granted
334
.

As
heretofore
,
our
Fellowships
are
available
to
assist
research
in
all
fields
of
knowledge
and
creative
effort
in
all
the
arts
.

Indeed
,
if
pressed
,
we
would
say
what
the
late
Robert
Henri
,
American
painter
,
said
to
a
pupil
,
Anything
will
do
for
a
subject
:
it's
what
you
do
with
it
that
counts
.

When
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
Manufacturing
Company
reached
its
125th
year
as
a
going
industrial
concern
during
1958
,
it
became
an
almost
unique
institution
in
the
mechanical
world
.

The
years
of
Joseph's
partnership
with
his
father
were
numbered
.

the
company
became
J.
R.
Brown
&
Sharpe
,
and
entered
into
a
new
and
important
period
of
its
development
.

The
basic
significance
of
this
invention
helped
them
to
follow
it
rapidly
in
1855
by
the
development
of
a
unique
precision
gear
cutting
and
dividing
engine
.

Mr.
Brown
made
important
additions
to
the
arts
in
screw
machine
design
by
drastically
improving
the
means
for
revolving
the
turret
,
by
introducing
automatic
feeding
devices
for
the
stock
,
and
reversible
tap
and
die
holders
.

During
the
Civil
War
period
Mr.
Brown
also
invented
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
formed
tooth
gear
cutter
,
a
basic
invention
which
ultimately
revolutionized
the
world's
gear
manufacturing
industry
by
changing
its
basic
economics
.

As
soon
as
the
time
came
for
re-sharpening
,
the
precise
form
of
the
gear
tooth
was
lost
and
a
new
cutter
had
to
be
made
.

As
head
of
the
firm
Darling
&
Swartz
,
Mr.
Darling
began
by
challenging
Brown
&
Sharpe
to
its
keenest
competition
during
the
1850's
and
early
60's
.

In
one
sense
it
can
be
said
that
one
of
the
most
important
Brown
&
Sharpe
products
over
the
years
has
been
the
men
who
began
work
with
the
company
and
subsequently
came
to
places
of
industrial
eminence
throughout
the
nation
and
even
abroad
.

Commencing
with
the
death
of
Lucian
Sharpe
in
1899
,
the
name
of
Henry
D.
Sharpe
was
for
more
than
50
years
closely
interwoven
with
the
destiny
of
the
company
.

Net
income
was
$2,557,111
,
or
$3.11
per
share
on
821,220
common
shares
currently
outstanding
,
as
compared
to
$2,323,867
or
$2.82
per
share
in
1959
,
adjusted
to
the
same
number
of
shares
.

Our
current
rate
of
incoming
orders
has
now
contracted
and
unless
this
trend
can
be
reversed
,
our
production
for
1961
will
be
lower
than
for
1960
.

In
connection
with
our
continuing
development
of
new
and
more
efficient
mill
machinery
,
a
sounder
U.
S.
income
tax
policy
on
depreciation
of
production
equipment
,
enabling
the
mills
to
charge
off
the
cost
of
new
machines
on
a
more
realistic
basis
,
could
,
if
adopted
,
have
favorable
effects
on
Leesona's
business
in
the
next
few
years
.

But
more
important
,
we
believe
,
it
must
concentrate
on
the
development
of
entirely
new
concepts
in
textile
processing
as
do
the
Unifil
loom
winder
and
our
more
recent
Uniconer
automatic
coning
machine
.

On
this
basis
,
our
already
substantial
budget
for
research
and
development
has
been
further
increased
in
recent
years
in
order
to
finance
the
continuing
engineering
and
design
work
essential
to
Leesona's
future
growth
in
sales
and
earnings
.

In
December
we
began
to
ship
our
ultra-high-speed
stretch
yarn
machines
.

These
machines
produce
the
higher
quality
stretch
yarns
required
in
weaving
stretch
and
textured
fabrics
.

During
the
past
year
,
great
progress
has
been
made
by
the
weaving
mills
in
creating
new
stretch
and
textured
fabrics
.

Fashion
centers
are
now
predicting
broad
acceptance
of
sports
apparel
and
improved
wash
and
wear
dresses
and
blouses
made
from
these
fabrics
.

This
machine
,
operating
at
speeds
up
to
350,000
revolutions
per
minute
,
is
believed
to
provide
one
of
the
fastest
mechanical
operations
in
industry
today
.

It
transfers
yarn
directly
from
the
producers'
largest
package
into
ideal
supply
packages
for
use
on
Unifil
loom
winders
in
weaving
stretch
yarn
fabrics
.

Our
new
large-package
ring
twister
for
glass
fiber
yarns
is
performing
well
in
our
customers'
mills
.

Later
in
the
year
,
additional
types
of
this
Leesona
twister
will
be
made
available
to
mills
for
other
man-made
fibers
and
natural
yarns
.

Major
activity
at
Providence
in
1961
will
involve
the
scheduled
completion
of
tooling
for
production
of
the
Uniconer
automatic
coning
machine
.

PMR
is
currently
supplying
components
vital
to
the
Titan
and
Minuteman
programs
.

All
operations
now
carried
on
at
our
plant
at
Cranston
will
be
transferred
to
Warwick
.

During
the
year
our
British
subsidiary
,
Leesona-Holt
,
Limited
,
expanded
its
plant
in
Darwen
,
England
,
and
added
machine
tool
capacity
.

The
new
Warwick
plant
is
being
built
at
our
expense
and
under
our
direction
.

We
will
then
occupy
the
new
plant
under
lease
,
with
an
option
to
purchase
.

We
believe
that
these
improved
facilities
will
contribute
income
and
effect
savings
which
will
fully
justify
the
investment
.

Long
term
loans
have
been
reduced
by
$395,000
to
$2,461,000
.

In
addition
,
Blue
Cross
coverage
for
all
employees
and
their
dependents
was
extended
to
provide
the
full
cost
of
semi-private
hospital
accommodations
.

As
in
many
other
industries
,
rising
costs
and
intense
competition
,
both
domestic
and
foreign
,
have
exerted
increasing
pressure
on
earnings
of
the
textile
industry
in
recent
years
.

As
a
designer
and
manufacturer
of
textile
production
machinery
,
Leesona
and
other
companies
in
its
industry
have
sought
to
meet
this
challenge
with
new
or
improved
equipment
and
methods
that
would
increase
production
,
yet
maintain
both
quality
and
flexibility
.

The
problem
of
efficient
production
in
textiles
is
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
industry
serves
large
markets
which
shift
quickly
with
changes
of
fashion
in
apparel
or
home
decoration
.

Production
must
be
adjusted
accordingly
,
at
minimum
cost
and
quickly
.

In
addition
to
the
many
appearances
of
these
organizations
throughout
the
college
year
,
there
are
concerts
by
students
of
the
music
department
,
by
members
of
the
music
faculty
,
and
by
visiting
artists
.

These
student-directed
organizations
include
eight
to
ten
members
each
;
;

from
the
founding
of
the
College
those
responsible
for
its
management
have
planned
to
provide
its
students
favorable
conditions
for
personal
religious
development
and
to
offer
opportunities
through
the
curriculum
and
otherwise
for
understanding
the
meaning
and
importance
of
religion
.

These
services
at
which
attendance
is
voluntary
are
led
by
the
Chaplain
,
by
the
President
of
the
College
,
by
selected
faculty
members
,
students
,
and
visitors
.

beset
by
pressures
to
meet
deadlines
,
tends
naturally
to
assume
that
others
must
be
as
familiar
with
a
problem
as
he
is
.

Indirectly
he
can
best
help
them
by
insuring
that
rigorous
criteria
for
appointment
and
promotion
are
clearly
set
forth
and
adhered
to
.

The
academic
dean
should
take
a
direct
,
long-term
interest
in
faculty
development
.

For
the
maintenance
of
a
long-term
program
,
the
departments
,
and
particularly
their
chairmen
,
are
strategic
.

To
provide
an
independent
judgment
for
the
president
,
the
academic
dean
also
investigates
candidates
thoroughly
.

Some
faculty
members
and
many
administrators
oppose
faculty
review
groups
because
they
either
repeat
department's
actions
or
act
pro
forma
.

They
can
be
effective
,
however
,
if
their
members
set
high
standards
for
candidates
and
devote
substantial
time
to
the
work
.

To
avoid
passing
over
quiet
,
unaggressive
teachers
as
well
as
to
decide
whether
others
merit
promotion
,
review
of
the
right
of
faculty
members
to
promotion
or
salary
increases
should
be
made
periodically
whether
or
not
they
have
been
recommended
for
advancement
by
their
departments
.

He
should
personally
consider
the
potential
of
a
faculty
member
proposed
for
tenure
,
to
guard
against
the
mistake
of
making
this
profoundly
serious
commitment
turn
solely
upon
the
man's
former
achievements
.

No
one
can
be
as
effective
as
the
president
in
inspiring
older
men
to
welcome
imaginative
new
teachers
whose
philosophy
or
approach
to
their
specialties
is
quite
different
.

A
true
university
,
like
most
successful
marriages
,
is
a
unity
of
diversities
Without
forcing
all
components
into
a
single
pattern
,
the
preparation
of
a
master
plan
is
an
opportunity
to
consider
interrelation
of
knowledge
at
its
highest
level
,
which
a
university
--
in
contrast
to
a
multiversity
--
should
stand
for
.

Or
shall
we
permit
early
specialization
in
scientific
and
technological
subjects
?
?

More
than
one
president
has
found
that
a
long-range
plan
helps
him
to
attract
major
gifts
.

The
first
step
is
a
comprehensive
self
study
made
by
faculty
,
by
outside
consultants
,
or
by
a
combination
of
the
two
.

Their
duties
include
evaluation
of
the
information
collected
and
preparation
of
recommendations
.

He
reviews
and
shapes
the
work
of
others
to
mold
a
single
joint
product
that
will
best
promote
the
aims
of
the
institution
.

In
the
national
interest
even
the
affluent
universities
must
consider
some
division
of
labor
among
them
to
replace
their
present
ambitions
to
keep
up
with
the
Joneses
in
all
branches
.

The
president
should
find
strong
subordinates
and
delegate
the
widest
discretion
to
them
.

Just
as
the
entire
faculty
should
know
the
president's
educational
philosophy
and
objectives
,
so
should
non-academic
officers
.

The
results
of
present
observations
of
the
thermal
radio
emission
of
the
moon
are
consistent
with
the
very
low
thermal
conductivity
of
the
surface
layer
which
was
derived
from
the
variation
in
the
infrared
emission
during
eclipses
(
e.g.
,
Garstung
,
1958
)
.

This
result
suggests
a
very
high
temperature
at
the
solid
surface
of
the
planet
,
although
there
is
the
possibility
that
the
observed
radiation
may
be
a
combination
of
both
thermal
and
non-thermal
components
and
that
the
observed
spectrum
is
that
of
a
black
body
merely
by
coincidence
.

For
the
case
of
Jupiter
,
the
radio
emission
spectrum
is
definitely
not
like
the
spectrum
of
a
black-body
radiator
,
and
it
seems
very
likely
that
the
radiation
reaching
the
earth
is
a
combination
of
thermal
radiation
from
the
atmosphere
and
non-thermal
components
.

The
low
intensity
of
the
radiation
from
Saturn
has
limited
observations
,
but
again
the
measured
radiation
seems
to
be
consistent
with
a
thermal
origin
.

They
deduced
from
their
measurements
that
the
radio
emission
from
the
whole
disk
of
the
moon
varied
during
a
lunation
in
a
roughly
sinusoidal
fashion
;
;

Recent
interferometer
measurements
(
Radhakrishnan
and
Roberts
,
1960
)
have
shown
the
960-mc
emission
of
Jupiter
to
be
partially
polarized
and
to
originate
in
a
region
of
larger
diameter
than
the
visible
disk
.

Therefore
,
neglecting
the
extreme
outbursts
,
reflected
solar
radiation
is
not
expected
to
cause
sizable
errors
in
the
measurements
of
planetary
radiation
in
the
centimeter-
and
decimeter-wave-length
range
.

Radio
observations
of
the
moon
have
been
made
over
the
range
of
wave
lengths
from
4.3
mm
to
75
cm
,
and
the
results
are
summarized
in
Table
1
.

These
contour
diagrams
also
suggest
a
rather
rapid
falloff
in
the
radio
brightness
with
latitude
.

The
constant-temperature
contours
are
much
smoother
than
those
observed
at
4.3
mm
by
Coates
(
1959
)
and
apparently
the
emission
at
8
mm
is
not
nearly
so
sensitive
to
differences
in
surface
features
.

The
half-intensity
diameter
of
the
antenna
beam
was
about
9'
,
and
the
angle
subtended
by
the
moon
included
the
entire
main
beam
and
part
of
the
first
side
lobes
.

Qualitative
observations
were
made
and
high-speed
motion
pictures
were
taken
to
study
flow
phenomena
in
the
arc
at
various
mass
flow
velocities
.

The
cooling
requirements
are
particularly
severe
at
the
anode
.

In
plasma
generators
as
currently
commercially
available
for
industrial
use
or
as
high
temperature
research
tools
often
more
than
50%
of
the
total
energy
input
is
being
transferred
to
the
cooling
medium
of
the
anode
.

The
heat
transfer
to
the
anode
is
due
to
the
following
effects
:
1
.

The
pressure
gradient
producing
the
jet
is
due
to
the
nature
of
the
magnetic
field
in
the
arc
(
rapid
decrease
of
current
density
from
cathode
to
the
anode
)
.

Feedback
of
the
energy
transferred
to
the
anode
by
applying
gas
transpiration
through
the
anode
.

The
cathode
consisted
of
a
diameter
thoriated
tungsten
rod
attached
to
a
water
cooled
copper
tube
.

The
anode
in
figure
2
was
mounted
by
means
of
the
anode
holder
which
was
attached
to
a
steel
plug
and
disk
.

Inflow
of
air
from
the
surrounding
atmosphere
was
prevented
by
the
two
disks
shown
in
figure
2
.

In
this
design
the
anode
holder
is
water
cooled
and
the
heat
losses
by
conduction
from
the
anode
were
determined
by
measuring
the
temperature
rise
of
the
coolant
.

To
reduce
heat
transfer
from
the
hot
gas
to
this
anode
holder
outside
the
regime
of
the
arc
,
a
carbon
shield
was
attached
to
the
surface
providing
an
air
gap
of
inch
between
the
plate
and
the
surface
of
the
anode
holder
.

The
argon
flow
from
commercial
bottles
was
regulated
by
a
pressure
regulator
and
measured
with
a
gas
flow
rator
.

The
power
source
was
a
commercial
D.
C.
rectifier
.

A
high
frequency
starter
was
used
to
start
the
arc
.

Experimental
procedure
and
error
analysis

Transpiration
cooled
anode
with
carbon
anode
holder

The
heat
losses
of
the
holder
were
to
be
reduced
as
far
as
possible
and
they
should
be
such
that
an
accurate
heat
balance
can
be
made
.

Its
temperature
was
denoted
by
Af
.

The
mean
temperature
of
the
surface
was
then
computed
according
to
the
following
relation
:
Af
where
x
is
the
fraction
of
the
plug
area
covered
by
the
hot
spot
.

The
Af
values
are
listed
in
Table
1
together
with
the
measured
surface
temperatures
and
arc
voltages
.

The
temperature
dependent
value
of
**ye
was
taken
from
Ref.
7
.

There
is
a
small
well
in
the
top
in
which
the
fluid
or
paste
to
be
tested
is
placed
.

By
the
use
of
various
weights
,
data
for
a
force-rate
of
shear
graph
can
be
obtained
.

This
,
however
,
can
only
be
considered
approximate
,
as
the
diameter
of
the
pulley
was
increased
by
the
build-up
of
tape
and
the
tape
was
occasionally
removed
from
the
pulley
during
the
runs
.

A
system
had
to
be
used
which
did
not
depend
upon
the
feeding
of
the
fluid
into
the
manometer
if
measurements
of
the
normal
pressure
were
to
be
made
in
a
reasonable
time
.

The
actual
pressure
was
not
determined
because
the
pressure
was
beyond
the
upper
limit
of
the
apparatus
on
hand
.

They
also
give
information
which
will
aid
in
the
design
of
a
more
satisfactory
instrument
for
the
measurement
of
the
normal
pressures
.

This
gives
Af
,
which
is
the
pressure
.

This
can
be
justified
thermodynamically
in
this
case
,
and
this
will
be
done
in
a
separate
paper
which
is
being
prepared
.

If
they
are
not
ellipsoids
,
the
conclusions
will
be
a
reasonable
approximation
.

The
direction
of
the
tension
of
minimum
pressure
is
,
of
course
,
given
by
the
direction
of
the
major
axis
of
the
ellipsoids
.

Mason
and
Taylor
both
show
that
the
major
axis
of
the
ellipsoids
is
at
45-degrees
at
low
rates
of
shear
and
that
it
approaches
the
direction
of
shear
with
increased
rates
of
shear
.

(
Some
suspensions
break
up
before
they
are
near
to
the
direction
of
shear
,
and
some
become
asymptotic
to
it
without
breakup
.

This
formula
is
given
by
Rumscheidt
and
Mason
.

However
,
there
are
photographs
of
suspended
drops
of
cyclohexanol
phthalate
(
viscosity
155
poises
)
suspended
in
corn
syrup
of
71
poises
in
a
paper
by
Mason
and
Bartok
.

If
it
is
assumed
that
the
formula
given
by
Lodge
of
cosec
Af
applies
,
the
pressure
difference
along
the
major
axes
can
be
calculated
from
the
angle
of
inclination
of
the
major
axis
,
and
from
this
the
interfacial
tension
can
be
calculated
.

The
internal
energy
of
an
ideal
gas
depends
on
temperature
only
and
is
independent
of
pressure
or
volume
.

In
other
words
,
if
an
ideal
gas
is
compressed
and
kept
at
constant
temperature
,
the
work
done
in
compressing
it
is
completely
converted
into
heat
and
transferred
to
the
surrounding
heat
sink
.

The
paramagnetic
dipole
effects
provide
some
information
on
the
particle
shapes
.

It
is
important
to
consider
and
experimentally
verify
this
influence
since
quantitative
nuclear
resonance
is
becoming
increasingly
used
in
investigations
of
structure
.

We
then
outline
the
theory
of
the
interaction
of
paramagnetic
dipoles
with
nuclei
and
show
that
the
theory
is
in
excellent
agreement
with
experiment
.

Af
bond
in
Af

Theoretical
studies
of
the
hydrogen
bond
generally
agree
that
the
Af
bond
will
be
linear
in
the
absence
of
peculiarities
of
packing
in
the
solid
.

There
is
ample
evidence
from
many
sources
that
the
Af
bond
in
Af
is
symmetric
.

Douglass
found
powder
intensity
calculations
and
measurements
to
agree
best
for
Af
.

These
data
lead
to
a
structure
in
which
sheets
of
Cr
atoms
lie
between
two
sheets
of
O
atoms
.

The
structure
appears
to
be
unique
among
OOH
compounds
,
but
is
the
same
as
that
assumed
by
Af
.

(
3
)
hydrogen
atoms
are
asymmetrically
placed
,
either
randomly
or
in
an
ordered
way
,
so
that
some
hydrogen
atoms
are
closer
to
the
upper
oxygen
atoms
while
others
are
closer
to
the
lower
oxygen
atoms
.

Dr.
Douglass
was
kind
enough
to
lend
us
about
5
grams
of
his
material
.

500
ml
of
1M
aqueous
Af
with
1
Af
added
are
heated
in
a
bomb
at
170-degrees-C
for
48
hours
.

This
latter
reaction
is
in
accord
with
the
reported
decomposition
of
Af
.

The
expected
weight
loss
for
Af
going
to
Af
and
Af
is
10.6%
.

Emission
spectra
indicated
Af
calcium
and
all
other
impurities
much
lower
.

The
x-ray
diffraction
pattern
of
the
material
,
taken
with
CuK**ya
radiation
,
indicated
the
presence
of
no
extra
lines
and
was
in
good
agreement
with
the
pattern
of
Douglass
.

Electron
microscopic
examination
of
the
Af
sample
showed
it
to
be
composed
of
nearly
isotropic
particles
about
0.3M
in
diameter
.

A
modulation
frequency
of
40
cps
with
an
amplitude
as
small
as
possible
,
commensurate
with
reasonably
good
signal-to-noise
quality
,
was
used
.

The
value
of
Af
estimated
at
470
gauss
was
Af
microseconds
.

This
measurement
was
obtained
by
W.
Blumberg
of
the
University
of
California
,
Berkeley
,
by
observing
the
breadth
of
the
free
induction
decay
signal
.

One
sample
,
which
had
been
exposed
to
the
atmosphere
after
evacuation
at
375-degrees-C
,
showed
the
presence
of
adsorbed
water
(
about
0.3
wt
)
)
as
evidenced
by
a
weak
resonance
line
which
was
very
narrow
at
room
temperature
and
which
disappeared
,
due
to
broadening
,
at
low
temperature
.

Spectra
were
also
obtained
from
a
sample
in
a
spherical
container
which
was
made
by
blowing
a
bubble
on
the
end
of
a
capillary
glass
tube
.

The
bubble
was
filled
to
the
top
and
special
precautions
were
taken
to
prevent
any
sample
from
remaining
in
the
capillary
.

One
gram
of
cotton
has
been
found
to
have
a
specific
surface
area
of
Af
.

This
is
best
demonstrated
by
practical
washing
tests
in
which
cloth
articles
are
repeatedly
washed
with
the
same
detergent
formulation
.

A
good
formulation
will
keep
the
clothes
clean
and
white
after
many
washings
;
;

whereas
,
with
a
poor
formulation
,
the
clothes
exhibit
a
build-up
of
tattle-tale
grey
and
dirty
spots
--
sometimes
with
bad
results
even
after
the
first
wash
.

Since
practical
washing
procedures
are
both
lengthy
and
expensive
,
a
number
of
laboratory
tests
have
been
developed
for
the
numerical
evaluation
of
detergents
.

Also
given
are
several
laboratory
wash
procedures
in
general
use
.

Large
numbers
of
potential
builders
have
been
investigated
,
but
none
have
been
found
to
be
as
effective
as
the
polyphosphates
over
the
relatively
wide
range
of
conditions
met
in
practice
.

Indeed
,
when
the
proper
inorganic
constituents
are
employed
,
practically
any
wetting
or
surface-active
agent
will
do
a
reasonably
good
job
when
present
in
sufficient
amount
in
a
hard-surface
cleaning
formulation
.

Physical
chemistry
of
washing

Stains
,
which
include
the
wide
variety
of
nonparticulate
materials
which
give
color
even
when
present
in
very
low
concentration
on
the
soiled
object
.

However
,
a
major
factor
in
binding
dirt
is
the
attraction
between
surfaces
that
goes
under
the
name
of
Van
der
Waal's
forces
.

Greases
,
stains
,
and
miscellaneous
soils
are
usually
sorbed
onto
the
soiled
surface
.

The
washing
process
whereby
soils
are
removed
consists
basically
of
applying
mechanical
action
to
loosen
the
dirt
particles
and
dried
matter
in
the
presence
of
water
which
helps
to
float
off
the
debris
and
acts
,
to
some
extent
,
as
a
dissolving
and
solvating
agent
.

The
other
constituents
in
a
built
detergent
assist
in
this
and
in
the
removal
of
dirty
stains
and
the
hydrophilic
sticky
or
dried
soils
.

As
is
well
known
,
detergent
actives
belong
to
the
chemical
class
consisting
of
moderately
high
molecular
weight
and
highly
polar
molecules
which
exhibit
the
property
of
forming
micelles
in
solution
.

Obviously
,
a
substance
which
is
permanently
or
temporarily
sorbed
on
the
surface
in
place
of
the
soil
will
tend
to
accelerate
this
process
and
effectively
push
off
the
greasy
soil
.

It
does
not
consider
the
kinetic
effects
of
the
phosphate
builders
on
sorption-desorption
phenomena
which
will
be
discussed
later
(
see
pp.
1746
-
1748
)
.

The
influence
of
mechanical
action
on
the
particles
of
free
soil
may
be
compared
to
that
of
kinetic
energy
on
a
molecular
scale
.

Freed
soil
must
be
dispersed
and
protected
against
flocculation
.

Upon
consideration
of
the
variety
of
soils
and
fabrics
normally
encountered
in
the
washing
process
,
it
is
little
wonder
that
the
use
of
a
number
of
detergent
constituents
having
synergistic
properties
has
gained
widespread
acceptance
.

Despite
extensive
attempts
to
obtain
highly
pure
reagents
,
serious
difficulty
was
experienced
in
obtaining
reproducible
rates
of
reaction
.

It
should
be
possible
to
free
carbon
tetrachloride
of
any
interfering
substances
by
the
usual
purification
methods
followed
by
prechlorination
prior
to
addition
of
radioactive
chlorine
.

Furthermore
,
the
exchange
would
not
be
expected
to
be
sensitive
to
trace
amounts
of
impurities
because
it
would
not
be
apt
to
be
a
chain
reaction
since
the
activation
energy
for
abstraction
of
chlorine
by
a
chlorine
atom
would
be
expected
to
be
too
high
;
;

It
was
then
distilled
at
least
three
times
from
a
trap
at
-78-degrees
to
a
liquid
air
trap
with
only
a
small
middle
fraction
being
retained
in
each
distillation
.

The
radiochlorine
was
stored
at
-78-degrees
in
a
tube
equipped
with
a
break
seal
.

The
mixture
was
then
extracted
with
alkali
and
with
water
following
which
the
carbon
tetrachloride
was
distilled
on
a
Vigreux
column
,
a
25%
center
cut
being
retained
which
was
then
degassed
under
vacuum
in
the
presence
of
Af
.

The
required
amount
of
carbon
tetrachloride
was
distilled
into
a
series
of
reaction
cells
on
a
manifold
on
a
vacuum
line
.

The
contents
of
the
manifold
for
liquid
phase
experiments
were
then
mixed
by
shaking
,
redistributed
to
the
reaction
tubes
,
frozen
down
,
and
each
tube
was
then
sealed
off
.

The
reactants
for
the
gas
phase
experiments
were
first
frozen
out
in
a
side-arm
attached
to
the
manifold
and
then
allowed
to
distil
slowly
into
the
manifold
of
pre-cooled
reaction
cells
before
sealing
off
.

Relative
incident
light
intensities
were
measured
with
a
thermopile
potentiometer
system
.

Calcium
hydride
was
substituted
for
Af
as
a
drying
agent
for
carbon
tetrachloride
.

No
correlation
between
these
variables
and
the
irreproducibility
of
the
results
was
found
.

In
most
cases
the
chlorine
concentration
was
about
Af
.

Some
80
reaction
tubes
from
13
manifold
fillings
were
illuminated
in
the
temperature
range
from
40
to
85-degrees
in
a
further
endeavor
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
irreproducibility
and
to
obtain
information
on
the
activation
energy
and
the
effect
of
light
intensity
.

The
photochemical
exchange
in
the
gas
phase
.

The
radial
velocity
varies
inversely
as
the
particle
size
--
a
1000-m-diameter
particle
near
the
orbit
of
Mars
would
reach
the
sun
in
about
60
million
years
.

Whipple
(
1955
)
extends
the
effects
to
include
the
solar-corpuscular-radiation
pressure
,
which
increases
both
the
minimum
particle
size
and
the
drag
.

Further
,
the
corpuscular
radiation
,
i.e.
,
the
solar-wind
protons
,
must
sputter
away
the
surface
atoms
of
the
dust
and
cause
a
slow
diminution
in
size
,
with
a
resultant
increase
in
both
the
Poynting-Robertson
effect
and
the
ratio
of
the
repulsive
force
to
the
gravitational
force
.

Another
important
source
of
evidence
only
recently
receiving
much
attention
is
the
analysis
of
atmospheric
dust
for
a
meteoritic
component
.

The
cores
of
deep-sea
sediments
and
content
of
collectors
in
remote
regions
are
valuable
in
this
category
.

The
impact
rate
on
1958
Alpha
for
153
events
was
Af
for
particles
of
mass
greater
than
Af
(
Dubin
,
1960
)
;
;

Ninety
per
cent
of
the
153
recorded
impacts
occurred
between
midnight
and
noon
,
and
from
day
to
day
the
variation
of
the
rate
was
as
much
as
an
order
of
magnitude
.

One
may
conclude
that
most
of
the
detected
micrometeoritic
material
is
concentrated
in
orbital
streams
which
intersect
the
Earth's
orbit
.

Note
that
the
mass
threshold
is
four
times
that
of
1958
Alpha
and
that
the
flux
is
one
fifth
as
large
.

The
calibration
of
piezoelectric
sensors
in
terms
of
the
particle
parameters
is
very
uncertain
.

Many
workers
believe
that
the
response
is
proportional
to
the
incident
momentum
of
the
particles
,
a
relation
deduced
from
laboratory
results
linearly
extrapolated
to
meteoritic
velocities
.

However
,
one
must
expect
that
vaporization
and
ejection
of
material
by
hypervelocity
impacts
would
cause
a
deviation
from
a
linear
relationship
.

In
the
United
States
,
most
of
the
sensors
are
calibrated
by
dropping
small
spheres
on
their
sensitive
surfaces
.

However
,
the
conversion
from
mass
to
size
is
unreliable
,
since
many
photographic
meteors
give
evidence
of
a
fluffy
,
loosely
bound
meteorite
structure
with
densities
as
low
as
Af
.

The
velocity
value
used
is
also
open
to
some
question
;
;

The
flux
of
micrometeorites
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
Earth
can
be
estimated
by
extrapolation
from
radar
and
visual
meteor
data
.

The
values
agree
with
the
data
from
1958
Alpha
and
1959
Eta
.

these
figures
constitute
the
best
estimate
for
the
flux
in
interplanetary
space
near
the
Earth
.

for
example
,
Jacchia
(
1948
)
derived
a
scale
of
0.15
g
for
a
Af
,
zero-magnitude
meteorite
.

A
concentration
distribution
has
been
derived
from
radar
observations
sensitive
to
the
fifteenth
magnitude
(
Manning
and
Eshleman
,
1959
)
.

Therefore
,
N
is
inversely
proportional
to
the
radius
cubed
and
in
fair
agreement
with
the
inverse
power
derived
from
1958
Alpha
and
1959
Eta
data
.

A
measure
of
the
total
mass
accretion
of
meteoritic
material
by
the
Earth
is
obtained
from
analyses
of
deep-sea
sediments
and
dust
collected
in
remote
regions
(
Pettersson
,
1960
)
.

A
man
can
be
an
effective
fighting
machine
throughout
the
incubation
period
of
most
infectious
diseases
.

The
intranasal
instillation
of
a
fluid
suspension
of
infectious
agent
in
an
anesthetized
animal
is
far
different
from
exposure
,
through
natural
respiration
,
to
aerosolized
organisms
.

There
are
optimal
humidity
requirements
for
various
agents
when
airborne
.

Neutral
or
inversion
meteorological
conditions
are
necessary
for
a
cloud
to
travel
along
the
surface
.

There
are
,
of
course
,
certain
times
during
the
24-hour
daily
cycle
when
most
of
these
conditions
will
be
met
.

Certain
other
properties
of
small
particles
,
in
addition
to
those
already
mentioned
in
connection
with
penetration
of
the
respiratory
tract
,
are
noteworthy
in
defense
considerations
.

There
may
be
a
number
of
secondary
effects
resulting
from
diffusion
through
buildings
such
as
widespread
contamination
of
kitchens
,
restaurants
,
food
stores
,
hospitals
,
etc.
.

The
particles
traveled
a
maximum
detected
distance
of
some
450
miles
.

These
dosages
could
have
been
increased
by
increasing
the
source
strength
which
was
small
in
this
case
.

The
behavior
of
a
biological
aerosol
,
on
a
much
smaller
scale
,
is
illustrated
by
a
specific
field
trial
conducted
with
a
non-pathogenic
organism
.

A
rough
attempt
was
made
to
characterize
the
vertical
profile
of
the
cloud
by
taking
samples
from
outside
the
windows
on
the
first
,
ninth
,
and
fifteenth
floors
of
a
Government
office
building
.

As
can
be
seen
from
Figure
2
,
an
extensive
area
was
covered
by
this
aerosol
.

As
can
be
seen
from
these
dosage
isopleths
,
approximately
100
square
miles
was
covered
within
the
area
sampled
.

Botulinal
toxin
,
for
example
,
is
several
thousand-fold
more
toxic
by
this
route
than
when
given
per
os
.

An
enemy
would
obviously
choose
an
agent
that
is
believed
to
be
highly
infectious
.

In
this
connection
it
should
be
capable
of
being
disseminated
without
excessive
destruction
.

One
might
expect
some
spread
of
the
disease
in
this
case
resulting
in
increased
effectiveness
of
the
attack
.

The
air
conditioning
and
ventilating
systems
of
large
buildings
are
subject
to
attack
.

A
variety
of
techniques
have
been
directed
toward
the
isolation
and
study
of
blood
group
antibodies
.

Modifications
of
the
last
technique
have
been
applied
by
several
groups
of
investigators
.

In
the
present
work
whole
sera
have
been
fractionated
by
chromatography
on
DEAE-cellulose
using
single
gradients
similar
to
those
described
by
Sober
and
Peterson
,
and
certain
chemical
and
serological
properties
of
the
fractions
containing
antibodies
of
the
ABO
and
Rh
systems
have
been
described
.

Three
of
the
anti-Rh
sera
used
were
taken
from
recently
sensitized
individuals
.

The
second
contained
incomplete
antibody
and
showed
titers
of
1
:
256
in
albumin
and
1
:
2048
by
the
indirect
Coombs
test
.

This
serum
exhibited
titers
of
1
:
16
in
albumin
and
1
:
256
by
the
indirect
Coombs
test
.

The
DEAE-cellulose
,
containing
0.78
mEq
of
,
was
prepared
in
our
laboratory
by
the
method
of
Peterson
and
Sober
(
7
)
from
powdered
cellulose
,
100
-
230
mesh
.

A
flow
rate
of
72
Af
was
used
and
12
ml
fractions
were
collected
.

During
the
latter
procedure
the
temperature
was
maintained
at
2-degrees-C
by
surrounding
the
apparatus
with
ice
.

At
the
end
of
the
run
,
the
strips
in
the
third
and
sixth
positions
in
each
chamber
were
dried
,
stained
for
1
hr
,
washed
and
dried
,
while
the
other
strips
were
maintained
in
a
horizontal
position
at
1-degree-C
.

Fractions
from
the
column
which
were
to
be
subjected
to
analytical
ultracentrifugation
were
concentrated
by
negative
pressure
dialysis
and
dialyzed
for
16
hr
in
the
cold
against
at
least
500
volumes
of
phosphate-buffered
saline
,
pH
7.2
,
ionic
strength
0.154
.

They
were
then
centrifuged
at
59,780
Pm
for
35
to
80
min
at
20-degrees-C
in
a
Spinco
model
E
ultracentrifuge
at
a
protein
concentration
of
1.00
to
1.25%
.

Successive
1-ml
fractions
were
then
drawn
off
with
a
hypodermic
syringe
,
starting
at
the
top
of
the
tube
,
and
tested
for
agglutinin
activity
.

With
either
of
the
gradients
described
,
chromatography
on
DEAE-cellulose
separated
agglutinins
of
the
ABO
series
into
at
least
three
regions
(
Figs.
1
and
2
)
:
one
of
extremely
low
anionic
binding
capacity
,
one
of
low
anionic
binding
capacity
and
one
of
high
anionic
binding
capacity
.

Not
all
these
regions
exhibited
equal
agglutinating
activity
,
as
evidenced
by
titer
and
the
extent
of
the
active
areas
.

Several
samples
of
citrated
plasma
were
fractionated
in
our
laboratory
by
Method
6
of
Cohn
et
al
.

Occasionally
,
you
may
come
across
one
or
two
bumblebees
in
the
cold
season
,
when
you
are
turning
over
sods
in
your
garden
,
but
you
have
to
be
a
really
keen
observer
to
see
them
at
all
.

Quite
often
,
honeybees
form
a
majority
on
the
willow
catkins
.

As
befits
a
queen
,
a
bumblebee
female
is
rather
choosy
and
may
spend
considerable
time
searching
for
a
suitable
nesting
place
.

Once
she
has
made
up
her
mind
,
the
queen
starts
out
by
constructing
,
in
her
chosen
abode
,
a
small
floor
of
dried
grass
or
some
woolly
material
.

The
first
worker
bees
do
not
mate
or
lay
eggs
;
;

The
young
queens
and
drones
leave
the
nest
and
mate
,
and
after
a
short
period
of
freedom
,
the
fertilized
young
queens
will
begin
to
dig
in
for
the
winter
.

It
is
an
amazing
fact
that
in
some
species
this
will
happen
while
the
summer
is
still
in
full
swing
,
for
instance
,
in
August
.

there
are
other
wild
bees
that
command
our
attention
.

One
of
my
favorites
is
A.
armata
,
a
species
very
common
in
England
,
where
it
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
lawn
bee
.

In
the
Sacramento
valley
in
California
,
for
instance
,
it
has
been
observed
that
there
was
not
one
day's
difference
between
the
emergence
of
the
andrenas
and
the
opening
of
the
willow
catkins
.

Often
the
burrows
are
only
an
inch
or
two
apart
,
and
the
bee
cities
cover
several
acres
.

In
most
places
,
there
are
two
generations
a
year
,
a
second
brood
of
adults
appearing
late
in
the
summer
.

The
best
chance
,
of
course
,
is
offered
by
gently
sloping
terrain
where
the
water
remains
close
to
the
surface
and
where
the
air
is
dry
,
so
that
a
high
evaporation
leaves
salty
deposits
which
permit
only
sparse
plant
growth
.

Many
other
(
probably
nearly
all
)
snakes
at
maturity
are
already
more
than
half
their
final
length
.

Felix
Kopstein
states
that
when
the
snake
reaches
its
maturity
it
has
already
reached
about
its
maximal
length
,
but
goes
on
to
cite
the
reticulate
python
as
an
exception
,
with
maximum
length
approximately
three
times
that
at
maturity
.

There
are
few
data
on
the
boa
constrictor
,
those
for
the
anaconda
are
unconvincing
,
and
there
is
nothing
at
all
on
the
amethystine
python
.

The
anaconda
proves
to
be
the
fly
in
the
ointment
,
but
the
reason
for
this
is
not
clear
;
;

Bernard
Heuvelmans
also
treats
of
the
largest
snakes
,
but
on
the
third
level
,
and
is
chiefly
concerned
with
the
anaconda
.

He
rejects
dimensions
of
70
feet
and
more
.

Raymond
L.
Ditmars
had
two
broods
that
averaged
27
inches
.

He
concluded
that
the
anaconda's
maximum
length
is
12
or
13
(
perhaps
14
)
meters
,
which
would
approximate
from
39
to
42
feet
(
14
meters
is
slightly
less
than
46
feet
)
.

However
,
many
herpetologists
remain
skeptical
and
would
prefer
a
tentative
maximum
of
about
30
feet
.

It
is
possible
that
especially
large
anacondas
will
prove
to
belong
to
subspecies
limited
to
a
small
area
.

In
snakes
difference
in
size
is
a
common
characteristic
of
subspecies
.

final
conclusions
will
have
to
await
the
measurements
of
broods
from
definite
localities
.

The
bronchus
and
pulmonary
artery
in
this
lung
type
maintain
a
close
relationship
throughout
.

It
does
,
as
in
type
1
,
,
supply
the
hilar
lymph
nodes
,
the
pulmonary
artery
,
the
pulmonary
vein
,
the
bronchi
,
and
the
bronchioles
--
terminating
in
a
common
capillary
bed
with
the
pulmonary
artery
at
the
level
of
the
respiratory
bronchiole
.

In
this
instance
,
because
of
incomplete
septation
,
the
secondary
lobule
does
not
constitute
in
itself
what
appears
to
be
a
small
individual
lung
as
in
type
1
.

Air-drifts
from
one
area
to
another
are
,
therefore
,
conceivable
.

Distally
the
bronchus
is
situated
between
a
pulmonary
artery
on
one
side
and
a
pulmonary
vein
on
the
other
,
as
in
type
1
(
(
fig.
24
)
.

Here
the
pulmonary
vein
,
as
in
type
2
,
,
is
noted
to
draw
away
from
the
bronchus
,
and
to
follow
a
more
direct
,
independent
course
to
the
hilum
(
figs.
23
,
24
)
.

As
seen
in
types
1
,
and
2
,
,
it
supplies
the
hilar
lymph
nodes
,
vasa
vasorum
to
the
pulmonary
artery
and
vein
,
the
bronchi
and
the
terminal
bronchioles
.

This
pleural
supply
is
derived
both
from
hilar
and
interlobular
bronchial
artery
branches
.

Some
of
these
were
obviously
filling
from
interlobular
branches
of
the
bronchial
arteries
while
others
were
filling
from
direct
hilar
branches
following
along
the
pleural
surface
.

Apparently
,
however
,
Miller
has
relied
heavily
on
the
anatomy
in
dogs
and
cats
,
and
he
has
been
criticized
for
using
pathologic
human
material
in
his
normal
study
(
Loosli
,
'38
)
.

However
,
this
artery
is
known
to
be
a
nutrient
vessel
with
a
distribution
primarily
to
the
proximal
airways
and
supportive
tissues
of
the
lung
.

The
alveoli
and
respiratory
bronchioles
are
primarily
diffusing
tissues
.

,
and
Tobin
(
'52
)
have
all
claimed
their
normal
but
relatively
nonfunctional
existence
in
the
human
being
.

Finally
,
it
is
suggested
that
in
many
respects
the
horse
lung
may
be
anatomically
more
comparable
to
that
of
the
human
than
any
other
presently
known
species
.

A
tabulation
of
these
features
permits
the
lungs
to
be
grouped
into
three
distinctive
subgross
types
.

In
type
3
the
bronchial
artery
also
provides
blood
directly
to
the
alveolar
capillary
bed
.

Although
the
standard
deviation
values
on
which
spread
of
the
lines
is
based
are
relatively
larger
for
those
centers
which
begin
to
ossify
early
(
Table
1
)
,
there
are
considerable
differences
in
this
value
between
centers
having
the
closely
timed
Onsets
.

There
the
middle
one
of
the
three
curves
denotes
mean
Skeletal
Age
for
the
Maturity
Series
boys
and
girls
.

Accordingly
,
maturity
level
ratings
by
means
of
the
upper
portion
and
lower
portion
of
the
Chart
,
respectively
,
should
be
somewhat
similar
since
Skeletal
Age
assessments
are
dependent
upon
Onsets
during
infancy
and
upon
Completions
during
adolescence
.

It
is
clear
that
there
are
some
differences
in
the
ratings
,
but
there
is
substantial
agreement
.

Such
an
indicator
,
or
indicators
,
are
needed
as
means
of
recognizing
specific
periods
of
delay
in
skeletal
developmental
progress
.

The
data
for
boy
34
appear
in
Figure
3
,
and
for
girl
2
in
Figure
4
.

When
the
dot
and
tip
coincide
,
the
classification
used
in
this
paper
is
Same
schedule
.

One
growth
center
in
a
short
bone
--
distal
phalanx
of
the
second
finger
--
was
chosen
as
an
example
for
discussion
here
,
primarily
because
epiphyseal-diaphyseal
fusion
,
the
maturity
indicator
for
Completion
in
long
and
short
bones
,
occurs
in
this
center
for
girls
near
the
menarche
and
for
boys
near
their
comparable
pubescent
stage
.

At
the
top
of
Figure
5
,
for
example
,
the
Onset
range
and
Completion
range
lines
for
the
chosen
growth
center
have
been
drawn
for
girls
according
to
their
mean
and
standard
deviation
values
in
Table
1
.

The
growth
center
depicted
here
,
in
the
distal
phalanx
of
the
second
finger
,
is
listed
as
the
fifth
of
those
in
the
seven
short
bones
.

thus
early
forecasting
of
the
pubescent
stage
would
appear
possible
for
only
seven
boys
.

Boy
34
,
like
girl
2
,
did
not
have
same
schedule
;
;

It
is
not
clear
whether
this
system
bears
any
resemblance
to
the
in
vivo
iodinating
mechanism
,
and
a
system
generating
peroxide
has
not
been
identified
in
thyroid
tissue
.

There
is
so
far
no
evidence
to
indicate
conclusively
that
this
coupling
is
under
enzymatic
control
.

Besides
proteolytic
enzymes
the
thyroid
possesses
de-iodinating
enzymes
.

A
microsomal
de-iodinase
with
a
pH
optimum
of
around
8
,
and
requiring
reduced
triphosphopyridine
nucleotide
for
activity
,
has
been
identified
in
the
thyroid
(
Stanbury
,
1957
)
.

It
is
assumed
that
the
iodine
released
from
the
iodotyrosines
remains
in
the
iodide
pool
of
the
thyroid
,
where
it
is
oxidised
and
re-incorporated
into
thyroglobulin
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
the
plasma
thyroxine-binding
proteins
,
which
have
an
extremely
high
affinity
for
thyroxine
,
compete
with
thyroglobulin
for
thyroxine
(
Ingbar
and
Freinkel
,
1957
)
.

On
the
other
hand
,
there
are
a
few
antithyroid
drugs
of
this
same
general
type
,
such
as
resorcinol
,
possessing
no
reducing
activity
and
possibly
acting
through
formation
of
a
complex
with
molecular
iodine
.

Besides
those
of
the
thiouracil
and
resorcinol
types
,
certain
antithyroid
drugs
have
been
found
in
naturally
occurring
foods
.

There
is
some
evidence
that
naturally
occurring
goitrogens
may
play
a
role
in
the
development
of
goitre
,
particularly
in
Tasmania
and
Australia
(
Clements
and
Wishart
,
1956
)
.

There
it
seems
that
the
goitrogen
ingested
by
dairy
animals
is
itself
inactive
but
is
converted
in
the
animal
to
an
active
goitrogen
,
which
is
then
secreted
in
the
milk
.

Besides
the
presence
of
goitrogens
in
the
diet
,
the
level
of
iodine
itself
in
the
diet
plays
a
major
role
in
governing
the
activity
of
the
thyroid
gland
.

In
the
experimental
animal
and
in
man
gross
deficiency
in
dietary
iodine
causes
thyroid
hyperplasia
,
hypertrophy
and
increased
thyroid
activity
(
Money
,
Rall
and
Rawson
,
1952
;
;

Further
,
the
gland
is
able
to
re-use
a
larger
fraction
of
the
thyroid
hormone
de-iodinated
peripherally
.

Here
we
shall
restrict
discussion
to
those
methods
that
appear
sufficiently
sensitive
and
precise
for
determining
the
concentration
of
TSH
in
blood
.

Brown
(
1959
)
has
reviewed
generally
the
various
methods
of
assaying
TSH
,
and
the
reader
is
referred
to
her
paper
for
further
information
on
the
subject
.

Chemical
constitution
and
physical
properties
of
pituitary
tsh

As
long
ago
as
1851
it
was
pointed
out
by
Niepce
(
1851
)
that
there
is
a
connection
between
the
pituitary
and
the
thyroid
.

The
first
attempts
to
isolate
TSH
came
a
decade
later
,
when
Janssen
and
Loeser
(
1931
)
used
trichloroacetic
acid
to
separate
the
soluble
TSH
from
insoluble
impurities
.

Two
problems
present
themselves
in
considering
any
hormone
in
blood
.

The
introduction
of
the
United
States
Pharmacopoeia
reference
standard
in
1952
and
the
redefinition
and
equating
of
the
USP
and
international
units
of
thyroid-stimulating
activity
have
made
it
possible
to
compare
results
published
by
different
investigators
since
that
time
.

Standard
preparations
and
units
of
thyroid-stimulating
activity

The
international
unit
(
u.
)
,
adopted
to
make
possible
the
comparison
of
results
from
different
laboratories
(
Mussett
and
Perry
,
1955
)
,
has
been
defined
as
the
amount
of
activity
present
in
13.5
mg
of
the
International
Standard
Preparation
.

No
additional
transfusions
were
necessary
after
the
institution
of
prednisone
in
July
,
1957
,
in
an
initial
dose
of
40
mg.
daily
with
gradual
tapering
to
10
mg.
daily
.

In
February
,
1958
,
the
patient
suffered
a
myocardial
infarction
complicated
by
pulmonary
edema
.

Electromyography
revealed
no
evidence
of
lower
motor
neuron
disease
.

Thyroid
function
tests
yielded
normal
results
.

A
Schilling
test
demonstrated
normal
absorption
of
vitamin
Af
.

From
March
3
to
May
1
,
1949
,
the
patient
was
maintained
on
dexamethasone
,
3
to
6
mg.
daily
.

The
terminal
hospital
admission
on
June
27
,
1959
,
was
necessitated
by
continued
weakness
and
debility
complicated
by
urinary
retention
and
painful
thrombosed
hemorrhoids
.

There
were
bilateral
pterygia
and
arcus
senilis
,
and
the
mouth
was
edentulous
.

The
coronary
arteries
were
sclerotic
and
diffusely
narrowed
throughout
their
courses
,
and
the
right
coronary
artery
was
virtually
occluded
by
a
yellow
atheromatous
plaque
1.5
cm.
distal
to
its
origin
.

Many
of
the
myocardial
fibers
were
hypertrophied
and
had
large
,
irregular
,
basophilic
nuclei
.

The
intimal
surface
of
the
aorta
was
covered
with
confluent
,
yellow-brown
,
hard
,
friable
plaques
along
its
entire
course
,
and
there
was
a
marked
narrowing
of
the
orifices
of
the
large
major
visceral
arteries
.

On
the
surfaces
of
both
lungs
there
were
emphysematous
blebs
measuring
up
to
3
cm.
in
diameter
.

The
endothelial
cells
lining
the
sinusoids
were
prominent
,
and
many
contained
large
quantities
of
hemosiderin
.

The
small
intestine
and
colon
contained
approximately
300
cc.
of
foul-smelling
,
sanguineous
material
,
and
the
mucosa
throughout
was
hyperemic
and
mottled
green-brown
.

A
careful
search
failed
to
show
occlusion
of
any
of
the
mesenteric
vessels
.

Cultures
taken
from
the
jejunum
yielded
Monilia
albicans
,
Pseudomonas
pyocanea
,
Aerobacter
aerogenes
,
and
Streptococcus
anhemolyticus
.

Occasional
tubules
contained
hyaline
casts
admixed
with
neutrophils
.

The
necrosis
often
involved
only
a
portion
of
the
length
of
a
given
fiber
,
and
usually
the
immediately
adjacent
fibers
were
normal
.

In
association
with
these
changes
in
the
fibers
,
there
were
striking
alterations
in
the
muscle
nuclei
.

The
nuclei
of
these
fibers
,
as
is
shown
in
Figures
3
and
4
,
showed
remarkable
proliferation
and
were
closely
approximated
,
forming
a
chainlike
structure
at
either
the
center
or
the
periphery
of
the
fiber
.

At
times
,
clumps
of
10
to
15
closely-packed
nuclei
were
also
observed
.

Occasionally
there
were
small
basophilic
fibers
that
were
devoid
of
myofibrillae
and
contained
many
vesicular
nuclei
with
prominent
nucleoli
(
Fig.
5
)
.

These
were
thought
to
represent
regenerating
fibers
.

(

)
In
other
experiments
the
indirect
conjugate
was
treated
with
3
volumes
of
ethyl
acetate
as
recommended
by
Dineen
and
Ade
(
1957
)
.

(

)
The
conjugates
were
passed
through
a
diethylaminoethyl
(
DEAE
)
cellulose
column
equilibrated
with
neutral
phosphate
buffer
(
PBS
)
containing
Af
potassium
phosphate
and
Af
.

The
latter
adhesive
was
found
to
be
much
more
satisfactory
.

After
drying
the
sections
under
the
fan
,
fixing
in
acetone
,
and
drying
at
37-degrees
as
in
the
indirect
method
,
the
sections
were
treated
with
conjugated
Af
or
Af
(
undiluted
unless
mentioned
otherwise
)
for
5
-
30
minutes
.

Such
sections
showed
bright
yellow-green
specific
fluorescence
in
the
cells
of
the
pseudophloem
tissue
(
Lee
and
Black
,
1955
)
.

Rinsing
the
sections
with
PBS
before
layering
the
intermediate
sera
did
not
improve
the
staining
reaction
.

When
1
ml
of
conjugate
was
passed
through
a
column
(
Af
)
,
the
first
and
second
milliliter
fractions
collected
were
the
most
specific
and
gave
no
nonspecific
staining
in
some
experiments
,
and
very
little
in
others
.

These
conjugates
Af
had
much
less
nonspecific
staining
than
the
previous
conjugate
(
with
50
mg
FITC
per
gram
of
globulin
)
while
the
specific
staining
was
similar
in
both
cases
.

Nonspecific
staining
could
be
satisfactorily
eliminated
by
passing
these
conjugates
through
a
DEAE-cellulose
column
as
described
for
Af
.

The
specificity
of
staining
with
Af
was
established
as
follows
:
Af
specifically
stained
tumor
sections
but
not
sections
of
healthy
sweet
clover
stems
or
of
crown
gall
tumor
tissue
from
sweet
clover
.

Sections
of
tumors
incited
by
WTV
were
not
similarly
stained
with
conjugated
normal
serum
or
conjugated
antiserum
to
potato
yellow-dwarf
virus
.

After
passing
Af
through
DEAE-cellulose
,
the
titer
of
antibodies
to
WTV
in
the
specific
fraction
was
1
:
4
of
the
titer
before
such
passage
(
precipitin
ring
tests
by
R.
F.
Whitcomb
)
;
;

but
mere
dilution
of
the
conjugate
to
1
:
4
did
not
satisfactorily
remove
nonspecific
staining
.

This
indicates
that
increase
in
specificity
of
Af
after
passing
it
through
DEAE-cellulose
was
not
merely
due
to
dilution
.

This
was
chiefly
because
of
the
bluish
white
autofluorescence
from
the
cells
.

The
autofluorescence
from
the
walls
of
the
xylem
cells
was
particularly
brilliant
.

Distribution
of
virus
antigen

Results
of
specific
staining
by
the
direct
and
the
indirect
methods
were
similar
and
showed
the
localization
of
WTV
antigen
in
certain
tissues
of
tumors
.

These
areas
are
thought
to
represent
the
nuclei
.

Treatment
of
the
conjugates
with
ethyl
acetate
,
and
the
conjugates
(
which
had
been
passed
through
Dowex-2-chloride
)
with
mouse
liver
powder
,
sweet
clover
crown
gall
tissue
powder
,
or
healthy
sweet
clover
proteins
did
not
satisfactorily
remove
nonspecifically
staining
substances
in
the
conjugates
.

A
study
of
the
distribution
of
WTV
antigen
within
the
pseudophloem
cells
indicates
that
it
is
irregularly
distributed
in
the
cytoplasm
.

Brakke
et

.

Since
emotional
reactions
in
the
higher
vertebrates
depend
on
individual
experience
and
are
aroused
in
man
,
in
addition
,
by
complex
symbols
,
one
would
expect
that
the
hypothalamus
could
be
excited
from
the
cortex
.

A
previously
extinguished
conditioned
reaction
was
restored
in
monkey
A
and
was
associated
with
typical
signs
of
emotional
excitement
including
sympathetic
discharges
.

But
even
in
relatively
primitive
laboratory
animals
such
as
the
rat
,
sex
activity
closely
identified
with
the
hypothalamus
and
the
visceral
brain
is
enhanced
by
the
neocortex
.

After
this
brief
discussion
of
neo-
,
paleocortical
,
and
cortico-hypothalamic
relations
,
let
us
return
once
more
to
the
problem
of
hypothalamic
balance
and
its
physiological
and
pathological
significance
.

Consequently
,
if
for
any
reason
the
hypothalamic
excitability
falls
below
the
physiological
level
,
the
lessened
hypothalamic-cortical
discharges
lead
to
a
diminished
state
of
activity
in
the
cortex
with
consequent
reduction
in
the
cortico-fugal
discharges
.

It
is
believed
that
drug
therapy
and
electroshock
involve
the
former
and
psychotherapy
the
latter
mechanism
.

Although
no
drugs
act
exclusively
on
the
hypothalamus
or
a
part
of
it
,
there
is
sufficient
specificity
to
distinguish
drugs
which
shift
the
hypothalamic
balance
to
the
sympathetic
side
from
those
which
produce
a
parasympathetic
dominance
.

The
shock
therapies
act
likewise
on
the
hypothalamic
balance
.

Physiological
experiments
and
clinical
observations
have
shown
that
these
procedures
influence
the
hypothalamically
controlled
hypophyseal
secretions
and
increase
sympathetic
discharges
.

They
shift
the
hypothalamic
balance
to
the
sympathetic
side
.

The
fundamental
differences
between
physiological
and
pathological
states
of
parasympathetic
(
and
also
of
sympathetic
)
dominance
remain
to
be
elucidated
.

If
,
for
instance
,
such
a
change
is
produced
by
one
or
a
few
insulin
comas
or
electroshocks
,
previously
inhibited
conditioned
reactions
reappear
.

In
other
studies
,
loss
of
differentiation
in
previously
established
conditioned
reflexes
resulted
from
repeated
convulsive
(
metrazol
)
treatments
,
suggesting
a
fundamental
disturbance
in
the
balance
between
excitatory
and
inhibitory
cerebral
processes
.

On
the
physiological
basis
of
some
form
of
psychotherapy

Since
strong
nociceptive
stimuli
produce
an
experimental
neurosis
during
which
the
animals
fail
to
eat
in
the
experimental
situation
,
Wolpe
thought
that
he
could
utilize
the
feeding-pain
antagonism
to
inhibit
the
neurotic
symptoms
through
feeding
.

Appropriate
experiments
showed
that
this
is
,
indeed
,
possible
.

The
feeding-pain
antagonism
seems
to
be
based
on
this
reciprocal
relation
between
the
tropho-
and
ergotropic
systems
.

Furthermore
,
a
functional
antagonism
exists
between
an
aggressive
attitude
and
a
state
of
anxiety
.

The
psychological
incompatibility
of
these
emotional
states
seems
to
be
reflected
in
,
or
based
on
,
this
marked
difference
.

We
are
trying
to
study
a
linear
operator
T
on
the
finite-dimensional
space
V
,
by
decomposing
T
into
a
direct
sum
of
operators
which
are
in
some
sense
elementary
.

The
second
situation
is
illustrated
by
the
operator
T
on
Af
(
F
any
field
)
represented
in
the
standard
basis
by
Af
.

The
idea
of
the
proof
is
this
.

This
completes
the
proof
of
statement
(
A
)
.

It
is
certainly
clear
that
the
subspaces
Af
are
invariant
under
T
.

This
shows
that
the
minimal
polynomial
for
Af
divides
Af
.

Now
Af
Af
so
Af
.

Then
there
is
a
diagonalizable
operator
D
on
V
and
a
nilpotent
operator
N
in
V
such
that
(
A
)
Af
,
(
b
)
Af
.

We
shall
prove
that
Af
.

Since
D'
and
N'
commute
with
one
another
and
Af
,
we
see
that
D'
and
N'
commute
with
T
.

Thus
D'
and
N'
commute
with
any
polynomial
in
T
;
;

Since
N
and
N'
are
both
nilpotent
and
they
commute
,
the
operator
Af
is
nilpotent
;
;

if
we
take
Af
above
,
that
will
be
large
enough
.

Thus
we
see
that
Af
and
Af
.

From
these
results
,
one
sees
that
the
study
of
linear
operators
on
vector
spaces
over
an
algebraically
closed
field
is
essentially
reduced
to
the
study
of
nilpotent
operators
.

In
concluding
this
section
,
we
should
like
to
give
an
example
which
illustrates
some
of
the
ideas
of
the
primary
decomposition
theorem
.

In
the
primary
decomposition
theorem
,
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
vector
space
V
be
finite
dimensional
,
nor
is
it
necessary
for
parts
(
A
)
and
(
B
)
that
P
be
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
.

Let
N
be
a
positive
integer
and
let
V
be
the
space
of
all
N
times
continuously
differentiable
functions
F
on
the
real
line
which
satisfy
the
differential
equation
Af
where
Af
are
some
fixed
constants
.

If
Af
denotes
the
space
of
N
times
continuously
differentiable
functions
,
then
the
space
V
of
solutions
of
this
differential
equation
is
a
subspace
of
Af
.

If
D
denotes
the
differentiation
operator
and
P
is
the
polynomial
Af
then
V
is
the
null
space
of
the
operator
p
(
,
)
,
because
Af
simply
says
Af
.

Let
us
now
regard
D
as
a
linear
operator
on
the
subspace
V
.

If
we
are
discussing
differentiable
complex-valued
functions
,
then
Af
and
V
are
complex
vector
spaces
,
and
Af
may
be
any
complex
numbers
.

In
other
words
,
if
F
satisfies
the
differential
equation
Af
,
then
F
is
uniquely
expressible
in
the
form
Af
where
Af
satisfies
the
differential
equation
Af
.

that
is
,
one
must
know
something
about
D
other
than
the
fact
that
it
is
a
linear
operator
.

However
,
one
does
not
need
to
know
very
much
.

that
is
,
Af
,
etc.
.

Thus
Af
if
and
only
if
Af
.

A
function
G
such
that
Af
,
i.e.
,
Af
,
must
be
a
polynomial
function
of
degree
Af
or
less
:
Af
.

Thus
F
satisfies
Af
if
and
only
if
F
has
the
form
Af
.

Accordingly
,
the
'
functions
'
Af
span
the
space
of
solutions
of
Af
.

The
binomial
probability
distribution
may
describe
the
variation
that
occurs
from
one
set
of
trials
of
such
a
binomial
experiment
to
another
.

The
major
question
in
this
chapter
is
:
What
is
the
probability
of
exactly
X
successes
in
N
trials
?
?

Before
deriving
this
formula
,
we
explain
what
we
mean
by
problems
of
this
kind
.

Each
trial
consists
of
choosing
a
student
manager
at
random
.

For
the
marksman
,
we
study
sets
of
five
shots
(
Af
)
;
;

Experiment
without
a
fixed
number
of
trials
.

Each
die
has
probability
Af
of
producing
an
ace
;
;

)
On
the
other
hand
,
even
when
the
binomial
model
does
not
describe
well
the
physical
phenomenon
being
studied
,
the
binomial
model
may
still
be
used
as
a
baseline
for
comparative
purposes
;
;

The
choice
of
P
and
N
determines
the
binomial
distribution
uniquely
,
and
different
choices
always
produce
different
distributions
(
except
when
Af
;
;

The
several
trials
of
a
binomial
experiment
produce
a
new
random
variable
X
,
the
total
number
of
successes
,
which
is
just
the
sum
of
the
random
variables
associated
with
the
single
trials
.

The
number
of
successes
on
each
shot
is
a
value
of
a
random
variable
that
has
values
0
or
1
,
and
there
are
5
such
random
variables
here
.

These
are
real
analytic
periodic
functions
with
period
T
.

In
the
following
paper
it
is
shown
that
in
a
certain
definite
sense
,
exactly
an
odd
number
of
squares
can
be
inscribed
in
every
such
curve
which
does
not
contain
an
infinite
number
of
inscribed
squares
.

This
theorem
is
similar
to
the
theorem
of
Kakutani
that
there
exists
a
circumscribing
cube
around
any
closed
,
bounded
convex
set
in
Af
.

A
square
inscribed
in
a
curve
C
means
a
square
with
its
four
corner
points
on
the
curve
,
though
it
may
not
lie
entirely
in
the
interior
of
C
.

As
S
approaches
T
the
square
will
be
outside
C
and
therefore
both
Af
and
Af
must
cross
C
an
odd
number
of
times
as
S
varies
from
zero
to
T
.

If
the
vertex
is
at
Af
,
and
if
the
interior
of
C
is
on
the
left
as
one
moves
in
the
direction
of
increasing
t
,
then
every
such
corner
can
be
found
from
the
curve
obtained
by
rotating
C
clockwise
through
90-degrees
about
the
vertex
.

The
set
of
intersections
of
Af
,
the
rotated
curve
,
with
the
original
curve
C
consists
of
just
the
set
of
forward
corner
points
on
C
corresponding
to
the
vertex
at
Af
,
plus
the
vertex
itself
.

We
will
denote
the
values
of
f{t}
on
different
components
by
Af
.

There
are
two
types
of
such
intersections
,
depending
essentially
on
whether
the
curves
cross
at
the
point
of
intersection
.

We
know
that
in
the
C-plane
both
C
and
Af
are
analytic
.

This
prevents
the
occurrence
of
an
infinite
sequence
of
isolated
tangent
points
.

(
B
)
Af
moves
away
from
C
and
does
not
intersect
it
at
all
for
Af
;
;

(
C
)
Af
cuts
across
C
and
there
are
two
ordinary
intersections
for
every
T
in
Af
.

For
it
is
clear
that
the
total
number
of
ordinary
intersections
of
C
and
Af
must
be
even
(
otherwise
,
starting
in
the
interior
of
C
,
Af
could
not
finally
return
to
the
interior
)
,
and
the
center
of
rotation
at
T
is
the
argument
of
the
function
,
not
a
value
.

The
number
of
ordinary
values
of
the
function
f{t}
at
T
will
be
called
its
multiplicity
at
T
.

The
graph
of
f
has
at
least
one
component
whose
support
is
the
entire
interval
Aj
.

Suppose
Af
is
defined
in
the
sub-interval
Af
.

But
this
is
a
contradiction
,
for
we
know
that
the
multiplicity
of
f{t}
is
odd
for
every
T
.

There
must
be
an
odd
number
of
such
components
,
which
will
be
called
complete
components
.

We
have
Af
,
plus
tangent
points
.

The
roots
of
this
equation
are
just
the
ordinates
of
the
intersections
of
the
graph
of
B
with
a
straight
line
of
unit
slope
through
Af
in
the
b-plane
(
the
plane
of
the
graph
of
b
)
.

In
1
we
investigate
a
new
series
of
line
involutions
in
a
projective
space
of
three
dimensions
over
the
field
of
complex
numbers
.

These
are
defined
by
a
simple
involutorial
transformation
of
the
points
in
which
a
general
line
meets
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
bearing
a
curve
of
symbol
Af
.

A
final
class
of
exceptional
lines
is
identifiable
from
the
following
considerations
:
Since
no
two
generators
of
Af
can
intersect
,
it
follows
that
their
image
curves
can
have
no
free
intersections
.

Finally
,
the
image
of
a
general
bundle
of
lines
is
a
congruence
whose
order
is
the
order
of
the
congruence
of
invariant
lines
,
namely
Af
and
whose
class
is
the
order
of
the
image
congruence
of
a
general
plane
field
of
lines
,
namely
Af
.

Thus
it
follows
that
the
secants
of
**zg
are
all
invariant
.

From
the
preceding
remarks
,
it
is
clear
that
such
a
bundle
is
transformed
into
itself
in
an
involutorial
fashion
.

Hence
it
follows
that
the
involution
within
the
bundle
must
be
a
perspective
De
Jonquieres
involution
of
order
Af
and
the
invariant
locus
must
have
a
multiple
line
of
multiplicity
either
Af
or
Af
.

the
second
requires
that
there
be
a
line
through
P
which
meets
**zg
in
Af
points
.

The
multiple
secants
,
of
course
,
are
exceptional
and
in
each
case
are
transformed
into
cones
of
order
Af
.

Observations
similar
to
these
can
be
made
at
each
point
of
Aj
.

Hence
**zg
must
have
either
a
regulus
of
Af-fold
secants
or
a
regulus
of
Af-fold
secants
.

For
if
such
were
the
case
,
either
the
plane
of
the
two
lines
would
meet
**zg
in
more
than
K
points
or
,
alternatively
,
the
order
of
the
image
regulus
of
the
pencil
determined
by
the
two
lines
would
be
too
high
.

Continuing
with
the
case
in
which
**zg
is
a
Af
curve
on
a
quadric
Q
,
we
first
observe
that
the
second
regulus
of
Q
consists
precisely
of
the
lines
which
join
the
two
free
intersections
of
**zg
and
the
planes
through
any
one
of
the
multiple
secants
.

When
necessary
,
we
should
make
it
clear
that
countries
which
choose
to
derive
marginal
advantages
from
the
cold
war
or
to
exploit
their
potential
for
disrupting
the
security
of
the
world
will
not
only
lose
our
sympathy
but
also
risk
their
own
prospects
for
orderly
development
.

The
colonial
period
has
generally
left
people
believing
that
government
can
,
if
it
wishes
,
provide
all
manner
of
services
for
them
--
and
that
with
independence
free
men
do
not
have
to
work
to
realize
the
benefits
of
modern
life
.

For
example
,
in
accordance
with
the
fashion
of
the
times
,
most
transitional
societies
have
announced
economic
development
plans
of
varying
numbers
of
years
;
;

American
policy
should
press
constantly
the
view
that
until
these
governments
demand
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
their
bureaucracies
there
is
not
the
slightest
hope
that
they
will
either
modernize
of
democratize
their
societies
.

Our
technical
assistance
to
these
countries
should
place
special
emphasis
on
inducing
the
central
governments
to
assume
the
role
of
advisor
and
guide
which
at
an
earlier
stage
foreign
experts
assumed
in
dealing
with
the
central
governments
.

We
should
encourage
the
governments
to
develop
their
own
technical
assistance
to
communities
,
state
and
provincial
governments
,
rural
communities
,
and
other
smaller
groups
,
making
certain
that
no
important
segment
of
the
economy
is
neglected
.

As
an
isolated
policy
,
land
reform
is
likely
to
be
politically
disruptive
;
;

Land
reform
programs
need
to
be
supplemented
with
programs
for
promoting
rural
credits
and
technical
assistance
in
agriculture
.

they
have
established
reasonably
stable
and
effective
governmental
institutions
at
national
and
local
levels
;
;

Finally
,
a
balance
must
be
effected
among
project
finance
,
utilization
of
agricultural
surpluses
,
and
general
balance
of
payments
support
.

There
remain
many
political
and
administrative
problems
to
be
solved
.

There
are
also
more
basic
problems
.

Nevertheless
,
impulses
still
exist
among
the
ruling
elite
to
rationalize
and
thus
to
perpetuate
the
need
for
centralized
and
authoritarian
practices
.

Particularly
when
based
upon
a
single
dominant
party
,
governments
may
respond
to
such
a
situation
by
claiming
a
monopoly
of
understanding
about
the
national
interest
.

With
the
exception
of
treaty-making
,
foreign
relations
were
historically
concerned
for
the
most
part
with
conditions
of
short
or
at
least
measurable
duration
.

but
basically
that
pace
depends
on
changes
in
the
supply
of
resources
and
in
the
human
attitudes
,
political
institutions
,
and
social
structure
which
each
society
must
generate
.

If
the
inner
functions
of
religion
are
performed
,
the
individual
is
a
composed
,
ordered
,
motivated
,
and
emotionally
secure
associate
;
;

Religion
seeks
to
satisfy
human
needs
of
great
pertinence
.

Related
to
this
is
the
fact
that
most
of
the
higher
religions
define
for
the
individual
his
place
in
the
universe
and
give
him
a
feeling
that
he
is
relatively
secure
in
an
ordered
,
dependable
universe
.

Death
is
not
permanent
defeat
and
disappearance
;
;

There
is
also
the
possibility
,
among
higher
religions
,
of
experiencing
consistent
meaning
in
life
and
enjoying
guidance
and
expansiveness
.

Under
the
religious
impulse
,
whether
theistic
or
humanistic
,
men
have
joy
in
living
;
;

It
gives
him
aid
,
comfort
,
even
solace
,
in
meeting
mundane
life
situations
where
his
own
unassisted
practical
knowledge
and
skill
are
felt
by
him
to
be
inadequate
.

Religion
is
vitally
necessary
in
both
societal
maintenance
and
regulation
.

In
America
also
all
of
our
major
religious
bodies
officially
sanction
a
universalistic
ethic
which
is
reflective
of
our
common
religion
.

for
example
,
marriage
as
a
sacrament
,
much
law-breaking
as
sinful
,
occasionally
the
state
as
a
divine
instrument
.

Finally
,
it
gives
meaning
to
much
social
endeavor
,
and
logic
,
consistency
,
and
meaning
to
life
.

Durkheim
noted
long
ago
that
religion
as
a
unified
system
of
beliefs
and
practices
relative
to
sacred
things
unites
into
one
single
moral
community
all
those
who
adhere
to
them
.

His
view
is
that
every
religion
pertains
to
a
community
,
and
,
conversely
,
every
community
is
in
one
aspect
a
religious
unit
.

Religion
usually
exercises
a
stabilizing-conserving
function
.

There
is
a
marked
tendency
for
religions
,
once
firmly
established
,
to
resist
change
,
not
only
in
their
own
doctrines
and
policies
and
practices
,
but
also
in
secular
affairs
having
religious
relevance
.

As
Yinger
has
pointed
out
,
the
reliance
on
symbols
,
on
tradition
,
on
sacred
writings
,
on
the
cultivation
of
emotional
feelings
of
identity
and
harmony
with
sacred
values
,
turns
one
to
the
past
far
more
than
to
the
future
.

At
the
same
time
that
religion
exercises
a
conserving
influence
,
it
also
energizes
and
motivates
both
individuals
and
groups
.

for
example
,
the
Crusades
,
mission
efforts
,
just
wars
.

Soon
Mrs.
B.'s
fears
threatened
to
burst
into
a
full-blown
panic
concerning
the
welfare
of
the
entire
family
.

Inability
to
care
for
the
other
children
,
difficulty
in
feeding
the
babies
,
who
seemed
colicky
,
bone-weary
fatigue
,
repeated
crying
episodes
,
and
short
tempers
reflected
the
family's
helplessness
in
coping
with
the
stressful
situation
.

Clearly
,
this
was
a
family
in
crisis
.

In
a
joint
interview
Mr.
and
Mrs.
B.
were
helped
to
understand
the
meaning
of
a
younger
son's
wandering
away
from
home
in
terms
of
his
feelings
of
displacement
in
reaction
to
the
arrival
of
the
twins
.

The
father
,
accurately
perceiving
the
child's
needs
,
not
only
respected
them
as
worthy
of
his
attention
,
but
immediately
satisfied
them
by
taking
him
on
his
lap
along
with
the
twins
,
saying
,
I
have
a
big
lap
;
;

Follow-up
visits
of
the
nurse
and
social
worker
indicated
continued
success
in
the
care
of
the
new
babies
as
well
as
a
marked
improvement
in
the
family's
day-to-day
mental
health
and
social
functioning
.

As
seen
in
the
B.
family
,
there
must
be
an
attempt
to
help
the
client
develop
conscious
awareness
of
the
problem
,
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
formal
request
for
assistance
.

The
unhealthy
use
of
denial
in
the
initial
reaction
to
a
stress
must
be
handled
through
the
medium
of
a
positive
controlled
transference
.

In
so
doing
he
implicitly
offers
the
positive
contagion
of
hope
as
a
kind
of
maturational
dynamic
to
counteract
feelings
of
helplessness
and
hopelessness
generally
associated
with
the
first
stages
of
stress
impact
.

Thus
,
the
client
receives
enough
ego
support
to
engage
in
constructive
efforts
on
his
own
behalf
.

While
some
suppression
and
some
denial
are
not
only
necessary
but
healthy
,
the
worker's
clinical
knowledge
must
determine
how
these
defenses
are
being
used
,
what
healthy
shifts
in
defensive
adaptation
are
indicated
,
and
when
efforts
at
bringing
about
change
can
be
most
effectively
timed
.

At
certain
critical
stages
,
and
only
for
sound
diagnostic
reasons
,
it
may
be
important
to
accompany
family
members
in
their
use
of
these
resources
if
their
problem-solving
behavior
is
to
be
constructive
rather
than
defeating
.

Finally
,
whatever
the
techniques
used
,
a
twin
goal
is
common
to
all
preventive
casework
service
:
to
cushion
or
reduce
the
force
of
the
stress
impact
while
at
the
same
time
to
encourage
and
support
family
members
to
mobilize
and
use
their
ego
capacities
.

Having
outlined
an
approach
to
the
theory
and
practice
of
preventive
casework
,
we
now
address
ourselves
to
our
final
question
:
What
place
should
brief
,
crisis-oriented
preventive
casework
occupy
in
our
total
spectrum
of
services
?
?

We
should
first
recognize
our
tendency
to
develop
a
hierarchy
of
values
,
locating
brief
treatment
at
the
bottom
and
long-term
intensive
service
at
the
top
,
instead
of
seeing
the
services
as
part
of
a
continuum
,
each
important
in
its
own
right
.

These
reports
refer
to
a
level
of
secondary
prevention
in
a
child
guidance
clinic
approached
by
the
customary
route
of
voluntary
referral
by
the
family
or
by
other
professional
people
.

In
some
programs
,
treatment
is
concentrated
over
a
short
period
of
time
,
while
in
others
,
after
the
initial
contact
is
established
,
flexible
spacing
of
interviews
has
been
experimentally
used
with
apparent
success
.

Woodward
,
for
example
,
has
emphasized
the
need
for
a
broad
spectrum
of
services
,
including
very
brief
services
in
connection
with
critical
situations
.

For
example
,
child
welfare
experience
abounds
with
cases
in
which
the
parental
request
for
substitute
care
is
precipitated
by
a
crisis
event
which
is
meaningfully
linked
with
a
fundamental
unresolved
problem
of
family
relationships
.

As
Loomis
remarks
,
In
the
internal
pattern
the
chief
reason
for
interacting
is
to
communicate
liking
,
friendship
,
and
love
among
those
who
stand
in
supporting
relations
to
one
another
and
corresponding
negative
sentiments
to
those
who
stand
in
antagonistic
relations
.

and
core
-
Negro
marriages
are
proscribed
for
core
members
.

There
is
some
indication
from
a
limited
number
of
interviews
with
members
of
the
population
that
the
element
of
power
,
primarily
the
voluntary
influence
of
non-authoritative
power
,
has
been
exerted
on
actors
in
the
system
,
particularly
in
regard
to
mate
selection
.

Loomis
considers
ranking
a
product
of
the
evaluation
process
.

To
some
extent
the
system
can
be
considered
a
Gemeinschaft
in
which
social-role
occupancies
are
determined
by
birth
,
by
attributes
such
as
sex
or
caste
,
which
are
biologically
or
socially
immutable
.

The
adherence
of
many
in
the
population
to
the
Indian
background
in
their
pedigree
,
and
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
their
ancestors
had
never
been
slaves
,
becomes
of
prime
interest
in
determining
how
far
these
elements
promote
the
self-image
of
the
intermediate
status
of
the
group
in
society
.

The
structural
subsystem
,
consisting
of
relatively
stable
inter-relationships
among
its
parts
,
includes
:
1
.

Roles
of
various
types
,
within
the
larger
system
and
within
the
subgroups
3
.

Regulative
norms
governing
subgroups
and
roles
.

However
,
it
cannot
be
presumed
,
informal
though
the
structure
of
the
population
seems
,
that
there
are
not
well-defined
roles
within
the
system
.

The
four
functional
problems
of
a
social
system
are
,
to
some
extent
,
solved
by
the
subsystems
within
this
population
.

Integration
has
to
do
with
the
inter-relation
of
parts
.

Of
particular
utility
in
the
analysis
of
the
development
,
persistence
,
and
change
of
social
systems
has
been
the
use
of
the
master
or
comprehensive
processes
.

Intense
interaction
is
easier
where
segregated
living
and
occupational
segregation
mark
off
a
group
from
the
rest
of
the
community
,
as
in
the
case
of
this
population
.

Urbanization
appears
to
be
an
important
factor
in
the
disintegration
of
this
group
.

In
the
urban
area
,
in
other
words
,
they
,
unlike
some
urban
ethnic
groups
,
do
not
concentrate
in
ghetto
colonies
.

To
the
extent
that
urban
life
contributes
to
the
breakdown
of
the
group
patterns
of
residential
isolation
,
to
that
extent
it
contributes
directly
to
increased
exogamy
.

By
means
of
this
social
control
,
deviance
is
either
eliminated
or
somehow
made
compatible
with
the
function
of
the
social
group
.

The
fertility
rate
pattern
would
seem
to
be
a
function
,
though
a
latent
one
,
of
the
process
of
maintaining
the
boundary
.

By
their
pattern
of
endogamy
and
exogamy
,
the
core
families
and
the
marginal
families
show
distinct
limits
to
the
intergroup
contact
they
maintain
.

Further
decrees
along
this
line
were
issued
in
1916
and
1919
.

In
1922
a
continuous
registration
of
the
whole
indigenous
population
was
instituted
by
ordinance
of
the
Governor-General
,
and
the
periodic
compilation
of
these
records
was
ordered
.

The
whole
system
was
again
reviewed
and
reorganized
in
1933
.

The
regulations
require
the
inscription
of
each
individual
(
male
or
female
,
adult
or
child
)
on
a
separate
card
(
fiche
)
.

Additional
entries
must
be
made
from
time
to
time
.

Each
adult
is
held
personally
responsible
for
assuring
his
inscription
and
obtaining
an
identification
card
which
must
be
shown
on
demand
.

Finally
,
the
registration
of
births
and
deaths
by
nearest
relatives
was
made
compulsory
in
most
regions
.

The
results
of
these
inquiries
were
used
to
adjust
compilations
of
data
from
the
registers
and
to
provide
various
ratios
and
rates
by
districts
,
including
birth
and
death
rates
,
general
fertility
rates
,
distributions
by
marital
status
,
fertility
of
wives
separately
in
polygynous
and
non-polygynous
households
,
infant
mortality
,
and
migration
.

The
scheme
,
in
theory
,
is
an
ingenious
adaptation
of
European
registration
systems
to
the
conditions
of
African
life
.

The
sampling
program
was
instituted
before
the
principles
of
probability
sampling
were
widely
recognized
in
population
studies
.

The
distinction
between
domiciled
(
de
jure
)
and
present
(
de
facto
)
population
was
not
clearly
defined
.

Here
again
it
seems
that
useful
approximations
of
the
size
and
geographical
distribution
of
the
population
were
obtained
in
this
way
in
the
late
pre-war
and
early
post-war
periods
.

This
agency
accepted
responsibility
for
medical
services
to
a
population
ranging
from
638,560
persons
in
1941
to
840,503
in
1956
in
the
Kwango
District
and
adjacent
areas
east
of
Leopoldville
.

Other
independent
,
or
partially
independent
agencies
,
have
promoted
investigations
on
topics
directly
or
indirectly
related
to
demography
.

L'Institut
pour
La
Recherche
Scientifique
En
Afrique
Centrale
(
IRSAC
)
has
sponsored
well-designed
field
investigations
and
has
cooperated
closely
with
the
government
of
Ruanda-Urundi
in
the
development
of
its
official
statistics
.

A
member
of
the
IRSAC
staff
(
E.
Van
De
Walle
)
was
recently
delegated
to
cooperate
with
AIMO
in
the
development
of
demographic
statistics
in
this
territory
.

We
will
deal
first
with
the
program
in
the
Congo
though
this
was
put
into
operation
later
than
the
other
.

Field
operations
were
transferred
from
administrative
personnel
primarily
engaged
in
other
tasks
to
specially
trained
teams
of
full-time
African
investigators
(
three
teams
,
each
working
in
two
provinces
)
.

Sample
units
(
villages
in
rural
areas
,
houses
in
cities
)
were
drawn
systematically
within
these
strata
.

Higher
proportions
were
sampled
in
urban
and
mixed
communities
than
in
rural
areas
.

Data
were
obtained
,
separately
,
on
three
classes
of
persons
:
(
A
)
residents
,
present
;
;

and
(
C
)
visitors
.

In
the
reports
,
summary
results
are
given
for
both
the
de
facto
(
A
and
C
)
and
de
jure
(
A
and
B
)
populations
;
;

but
the
subsequent
analysis
of
characteristics
is
reported
only
for
the
de
jure
population
(
or
,
in
some
districts
,
only
the
de
facto
population
)
.

It
provides
a
frame
for
the
sampling
census
.

Even
though
the
registers
may
have
an
incomplete
record
of
persons
present
in
a
particular
area
or
include
persons
no
longer
living
there
,
they
contain
precise
information
on
ages
,
by
date
of
birth
,
for
some
of
the
persons
present
(
especially
children
in
relatively
stable
communities
)
and
supplementary
information
(
such
as
records
of
marital
status
)
for
many
others
.

This
report
contains
preliminary
notes
and
35
tables
.

However
,
all
admitted
that
the
hindsight
was
not
altogether
lost
.

In
their
own
words
,
it
had
aided
them
to
get
a
clearer
picture
of
how
they
had
gotten
into
their
marriages
,
and
perhaps
they
had
obtained
some
insights
on
why
certain
troubles
appeared
from
time
to
time
.

In
fact
,
they
went
so
far
as
to
caution
the
writer
that
if
he
attempted
to
design
a
section
exclusively
for
married
students
there
should
be
,
at
the
beginning
,
some
hindsight
study
;
;

As
one
of
them
expressed
it
,
It
has
done
me
a
world
of
good
to
listen
to
the
naive
questions
and
comments
of
these
not-yet-married
people
.

I
can
now
better
see
just
what
processes
provoked
certain
actions
from
me
in
the
past
.

By
permitting
freshman
students
we
might
extend
the
opportunity
for
such
a
course
to
some
individuals
who
otherwise
might
never
get
to
take
it
.

The
philosophy
has
been
that
if
they
could
find
the
time
to
attend
class
why
not
encourage
them
to
get
the
credit
and
perhaps
provide
an
incentive
to
do
the
work
more
effectively
.

But
in
this
one
section
we
welcomed
auditors
.

For
no
particular
reason
,
other
than
that
the
writer
felt
it
might
--
just
might
--
encourage
both
mates
to
be
in
attendance
.

This
experimental
class
represented
quite
a
variety
of
students
.

It
ranged
from
those
with
no
children
,
through
students
in
various
stages
of
pregnancy
,
to
one
44-year-old
male
with
four
children
,
three
of
whom
were
teenagers
.

Some
of
these
speculations
may
have
some
merit
,
others
are
somewhat
ambiguous
.

This
is
to
say
that
this
was
not
a
course
in
wise
buying
or
money
spending
methods
,
nor
a
course
in
how
to
raise
children
.

We
already
have
courses
covering
those
problems
,
and
so
on
.

But
within
that
framework
he
allowed
for
as
much
flexibility
as
possible
.

Films
were
used
,
as
with
all
sections
,
but
with
one
big
difference
.

Since
they
are
all
either
rented
or
borrowed
,
the
requested
dates
for
their
use
have
to
be
far
in
advance
.

Thus
the
films
seen
as
they
came
in
(
coordinated
for
the
regular
sections
)
,
were
often
out
of
context
.

Since
the
writer
had
not
noticed
this
characteristic
in
married
students
scattered
throughout
the
various
sections
previous
to
this
experiment
,
nor
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
in
those
who
were
continuing
in
single
sections
,
he
can
only
conclude
that
there
must
have
been
something
contagious
within
the
specific
group
which
caused
this
to
occur
.

In
short
,
it
was
centered
around
learning
how
to
develop
a
more
sensitive
empathy
.

Since
the
course
,
one
member
has
lost
her
husband
.

This
was
not
a
particularly
shocking
or
unexpected
thing
--
it
was
previously
known
to
her
that
it
might
happen
.

But
just
when
was
an
unknown
,
and
of
course
the
longer
it
did
not
happen
,
the
stronger
her
wish
and
belief
that
it
might
not
.

He
felt
certain
for
the
first
time
in
his
teaching
experience
that
the
men
in
the
class
understood
that
orgasm
,
as
a
criterion
,
is
not
nearly
so
essential
for
a
satisfying
female
sexual
experience
as
most
males
might
think
.

This
was
true
mostly
of
those
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
who
did
not
perceive
the
ambiguous
figure
as
people
in
action
.

Responses
such
as
rope
with
a
loop
in
it
,
and
two
pieces
of
rope
,
were
quite
characteristic
.

The
three
personality
inventories
(
Guilford
;
;

One
prediction
had
been
made
about
the
difference
in
security
or
self-confidence
between
those
subjects
who
shifted
their
Kohnstamm
reactivity
when
informed
and
those
who
did
not
.

A
t
test
on
these
two
groups
,
shifters
vs.
nonshifters
,
gave
a
t
value
of
2.405
which
is
significant
on
the
two-tail
test
at
the

Only
27%
(
11
subjects
)
gave
a
positive
Kohnstamm
reaction
when
completely
naive
concerning
the
phenomenon
.

One
subject
changed
when
given
only
the
information
that
some
people
have
something
happen
to
their
arm
when
they
relax
.

At
no
time
was
it
implied
by
the
experimenter
that
the
subject's
initial
reaction
was
deviant
.

They
continued
to
give
an
arm-elevation
.

While
they
were
told
that
there
were
some
normal
people
who
reacted
differently
than
they
had
,
they
were
also
informed
that
there
were
other
normals
who
reacted
as
they
had
.

There
was
no
implication
made
that
their
initial
reaction
(
absence
of
an
arm-elevation
)
was
less
preferred
than
the
presence
of
levitation
.

The
naive
state
,
Condition
1
,
,
could
therefore
be
viewed
as
an
inhibiting
one
for
24%
of
the
subjects
in
this
study
.

Alcohol
ingestion
succeeded
in
changing
immobility
to
mobility
quite
strikingly
in
one
pilot
subject
(
the
only
one
with
whom
this
technique
was
tried
)
.

After
two
drinks
containing
alcohol
,
her
arm
flew
upward
very
freely
.

She
explained
nonreactivity
of
others
by
saying
that
they
were
not
letting
themselves
relax
.

The
above
discussion
does
not
mean
to
imply
that
control
factors
were
completely
in
abeyance
in
the
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
;
;

but
rather
that
they
could
be
diminished
sufficiently
not
to
interfere
with
arm-levitation
.

They
knew
that
their
perceptual
experience
differed
from
objective
reality
since
they
had
seen
the
desk
and
ball
prior
to
putting
on
the
aniseikonic
lenses
.

The
change
in
perceptions
by
some
of
the
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
,
after
they
had
been
informed
of
the
possibilities
of
normal
reactions
,
suggests
that
their
constriction
and
guardedness
is
associated
with
their
general
mode
of
responding
to
strange
or
unknown
situations
.

They
were
able
to
experience
at
first
,
in
terms
of
past
conventionality
.

The
structured
schools
were
in
an
industrial
city
,
with
three-family
tenement
houses
typical
of
the
residential
areas
,
but
with
one
rather
sizable
section
of
middle-class
homes
.

Individual
differences
in
maturation
and
the
development
of
readiness
for
learning
to
read
indicate
that
not
until
the
third
grade
have
most
children
had
ample
opportunity
to
demonstrate
their
capacity
for
school
achievement
.

It
was
assumed
that
the
sampling
procedure
was
purely
random
with
respect
to
the
personality
variables
under
investigation
.

For
instance
,
the
following
statement
was
rated
low
in
compulsivity
,
She's
naturally
quite
neat
about
things
,
but
it
doesn't
bother
her
at
all
if
her
room
gets
messy
.

But
she
cleans
it
up
very
well
when
I
remind
her
.

The
Taylor
Scale
was
adapted
from
the
Minnesota
Multiphastic
Personality
Inventory
,
with
item
selection
based
upon
clinical
definitions
of
anxiety
.

Reliability
and
validation
work
with
the
Children's
Anxiety
Scale
by
Castaneda
,
et
al
demonstrated
results
closely
similar
to
the
findings
with
the
adult
scale
.

All
of
these
sub-tests
involve
reading
except
Arithmetic
Computation
.

The
criterion
score
used
in
the
statistical
analysis
is
an
index
of
over-
or
under-achievement
.

No
significant
difference
was
found
in
achievement
between
high
and
low
compulsive
children
within
the
unstructured
school
.

As
predicted
,
the
highly
anxious
children
in
the
unstructured
schools
score
more
poorly
(
Af
)
than
those
in
the
structured
schools
.

The
fact
that
such
threat
is
potent
in
the
beginning
reading
lessons
is
thought
to
be
a
vital
factor
in
the
continued
pattern
of
failure
or
under-achievement
these
children
exhibit
.

But
the
symbols
he
is
asked
to
learn
are
simple
.

By
the
time
the
child
first
attacks
the
actual
problem
of
reading
,
he
is
completely
familiar
and
at
ease
with
all
of
the
elements
of
words
.

Sarason
et
al
present
evidence
that
the
anxious
child
will
suffer
in
the
test-like
situation
,
and
that
his
performance
will
be
impaired
unless
he
receives
supporting
and
accepting
treatment
from
the
teacher
.

Let
us
now
put
some
flesh
on
the
theoretical
bones
we
have
assembled
by
giving
illustrations
of
roleplaying
used
for
evaluation
and
analysis
.

Interviewing
,
checking
references
,
training
the
salesmen
,
having
them
go
with
more
experienced
salesmen
was
expensive
--
and
the
rate
of
attrition
due
to
resignations
or
unsatisfactory
performance
was
too
high
.

In
place
of
asking
salesmen
to
fill
questionnaires
,
checking
their
references
,
interviewing
them
,
asking
them
to
be
tried
out
,
he
told
them
he
would
prefer
to
test
them
.

In
the
testing
room
,
three
of
the
veteran
salesmen
served
as
antagonists
.

The
antagonists
came
in
,
one
at
a
time
,
and
did
not
see
or
hear
the
other
presentations
.

The
president
of
the
firm
,
calculating
expenses
alone
,
felt
his
costs
had
dropped
one-half
while
success
in
selection
had
improved
over
one
hundred
per
cent
.

Each
girl
was
independently
tested
by
the
personnel
man
,
and
he
served
not
only
as
the
director
,
but
as
the
antagonist
and
the
observer
.

She
was
hired
and
was
found
to
be
entirely
satisfactory
when
she
played
the
role
eight
hours
a
day
.

In
considering
roleplaying
for
analysis
we
enter
a
more
complex
area
,
since
we
are
now
no
longer
dealing
with
a
simple
over-all
decision
but
rather
with
the
examination
and
evaluation
of
many
elements
seen
in
dynamic
functioning
.

An
engineer
had
been
made
the
works
manager
of
a
firm
,
supplanting
a
retired
employee
who
had
been
considered
outstandingly
successful
.

At
the
insistence
of
his
own
supervisor
--
the
president
of
the
firm
--
he
enrolled
in
a
course
designed
to
develop
leaders
.

He
did
not
really
listen
to
others
,
had
little
interest
in
their
ideas
,
and
wanted
to
have
his
own
way
--
which
was
the
only
right
way
.

The
entire
group
of
managers
explained
,
in
great
detail
,
a
number
of
human
relations
errors
that
he
made
.

He
admitted
his
behavior
,
and
defended
it
.

He
refused
to
change
his
approach
,
and
instead
he
attacked
high
and
low
--
the
officials
for
their
not
backing
him
,
and
subordinates
for
their
laxness
,
stupidity
,
and
stubbornness
.

We
may
say
that
his
problem
was
diagnosed
but
that
he
refused
treatment
.

These
errors
were
then
collected
and
written
on
a
blackboard
,
condensing
similar
ideas
.

The
manager
sat
behind
the
group
so
he
could
see
and
count
the
hands
that
went
up
,
and
the
director
wrote
the
numbers
on
the
blackboard
.

We
can
see
others
more
clearly
than
we
can
see
ourselves
,
and
others
can
see
us
better
than
we
see
ourselves
.

To
learn
what
we
do
is
the
first
step
for
improvement
.

To
use
these
new
ways
in
daily
life
is
the
last
step
.

When
an
evaluative
situation
is
set
up
,
and
no
concern
is
with
the
details
that
lead
to
an
over-all
estimate
,
we
say
that
roleplaying
is
used
for
evaluation
.

Observers
can
see
a
person
engaged
in
spontaneous
behavior
,
and
watch
him
operating
in
a
totalistic
fashion
.

One
learns
to
become
alert
to
changes
in
his
vocal
tone
--
to
his
voice's
suddenly
shifting
to
a
quality
not
like
his
usual
one
,
a
quality
which
sounds
somehow
artificial
or
,
in
some
instances
,
parrot-like
.

and
when
I
replied
in
this
spirit
,
she
corroborated
my
hunch
.

She
looked
confused
at
this
,
and
I
felt
sure
it
had
been
a
wrong
response
for
me
to
make
.

A
somewhat
less
fragmented
hebephrenic
patient
of
mine
,
who
used
to
often
seclude
herself
in
her
room
,
often
sounded
through
the
closed
door
--
as
I
would
find
on
passing
by
,
between
our
sessions
--
for
all
the
world
like
two
persons
,
a
scolding
mother
and
a
defensive
child
.

This
behavior
on
her
part
subsided
only
after
I
had
come
to
see
the
uncomfortably
close
similarity
between
,
on
the
one
hand
,
her
arranging
the
ventilation
of
the
common
living
room
to
her
own
liking
,
or
turning
the
television
off
or
on
without
regard
to
the
wishes
of
the
others
,
and
on
the
other
hand
,
my
own
coming
stolidly
into
her
room
despite
her
persistent
and
vociferous
objections
,
bringing
my
big
easy
chair
with
me
,
usually
shutting
the
windows
of
her
room
which
she
preferred
to
keep
in
a
very
cold
state
,
and
plunking
myself
down
in
my
chair
--
in
short
,
behaving
as
if
I
owned
her
room
.

,
the
patient
replied
,
Both
,
Dearie
--
two
in
one
.

To
a
much
less
full
extent
,
the
hebephrenic
person's
belching
or
flatus
has
a
comparable
communicative
function
;
;

in
working
with
these
patients
the
therapist
eventually
gets
to
do
some
at
least
private
mulling
over
of
the
possible
meaning
of
a
belch
,
or
the
passage
of
flatus
,
not
only
because
he
is
reduced
to
this
for
lack
of
anything
else
to
analyze
,
but
also
because
he
learns
that
even
these
animal-like
sounds
constitute
forms
of
communication
in
which
,
from
time
to
time
,
quite
different
things
are
being
said
,
long
before
the
patient
can
become
sufficiently
aware
of
these
,
as
distinct
feelings
and
concepts
,
to
say
them
in
words
.

In
my
experience
,
a
great
many
of
the
patient's
more
puzzling
verbal
communications
are
so
for
the
reason
that
concrete
meanings
have
not
become
differentiated
from
figurative
meanings
in
his
subjective
experience
.

Thus
he
may
be
referring
to
some
concrete
thing
,
or
incident
,
in
his
immediate
environment
by
some
symbolic-sounding
,
hyperbolic
reference
to
transcendental
events
on
the
global
scene
.

Dictionary
forms
found
to
match
forms
in
the
text
list
are
marked
.

The
dictionary
is
a
form
dictionary
,
at
least
in
the
sense
that
complete
forms
are
used
as
the
basis
for
matching
text
occurrences
with
dictionary
entries
.

A
more
detailed
description
of
dictionary
operations
--
text
lookup
and
dictionary
modification
--
gives
a
clearer
picture
.

If
cell
Af
has
not
previously
been
assigned
as
the
information
cell
of
a
form
in
the
text-form
list
,
it
is
now
assigned
as
the
information
cell
of
Af
.

When
this
situation
exists
,
the
address
Af
will
equal
Af
which
was
produced
from
Af
.

When
,
as
in
this
case
,
the
two
forms
match
,
the
address
Af
is
saved
to
represent
the
occurrence
Af
.

A
third
situation
is
possible
.

The
formula
for
computing
random
addresses
from
the
form
of
each
occurrence
will
not
give
a
distinct
address
for
each
distinct
form
.

Thus
,
when
more
than
one
distinct
form
leads
to
a
particular
cell
in
the
X-region
,
a
chain
of
information
cells
must
be
created
to
accommodate
the
forms
,
one
cell
in
the
chain
for
each
form
.

Hence
,
when
the
address
Af
is
computed
from
Af
,
the
cell
Af
and
all
Y-cells
in
its
chain
must
be
inspected
to
determine
whether
Af
is
already
in
the
form
list
or
whether
it
should
be
added
to
the
form
list
and
the
chain
.

If
cell
Af
is
not
an
information
cell
we
conclude
that
the
i-th
dictionary
form
is
not
in
the
text
list
.

The
list
of
text
forms
in
the
W-region
of
memory
and
the
contents
of
the
information
cells
in
the
X
and
Y-regions
are
no
longer
required
.

The
grammatical
descriptions
of
all
forms
in
the
dictionary
are
recorded
in
a
separate
part
of
the
dictionary
file
.

)
When
the
complete
file
has
been
read
,
the
grammatical
descriptions
for
all
text
forms
found
in
the
dictionary
have
been
stored
in
the
W-region
;
;

For
example
,
the
inflected
forms
of
a
word
can
be
represented
,
insofar
as
regular
inflection
allows
,
by
a
stem
and
a
set
of
endings
to
be
attached
.

Entries
are
summarized
only
when
by
doing
so
the
amount
of
information
retained
in
the
dictionary
is
reduced
and
the
time
required
for
dictionary
operations
is
decreased
.

The
tendency
is
toward
putting
dominant
stress
at
the
end
.

Where
there
is
comparison
or
contrast
,
dominant
stresses
normally
operate
to
center
attention
.

Here
again
,
in
the
written
language
it
is
possible
to
help
the
reader
get
his
stresses
right
by
using
underlining
or
italics
,
but
much
of
the
time
there
is
simply
reliance
on
his
understanding
in
the
light
of
context
.

--
Syllables
are
linguistic
units
centering
in
peaks
which
are
usually
vocalic
but
,
as
has
been
noted
,
are
consonantal
under
certain
circumstances
,
and
which
may
or
may
not
be
combined
with
preceding
following
consonants
or
combinations
of
consonants
.

This
limited
familiarity
with
the
possible
phenomena
has
severely
hampered
work
with
tone
.

The
great
majority
of
present-day
linguists
fall
into
one
or
more
of
a
number
of
overlapping
types
:
those
who
are
convinced
that
tone
cannot
be
analysed
,
those
who
are
personally
scared
of
tone
and
tone
languages
generally
,
those
who
are
convinced
that
tone
is
merely
an
unnecessary
marginal
feature
in
those
languages
where
it
occurs
,
those
who
have
no
idea
how
to
proceed
with
tone
analysis
,
those
who
take
a
simplistic
view
of
the
whole
matter
.

Actually
,
none
of
these
papers
says
much
directly
about
field
techniques
.

One
issue
that
must
be
faced
is
the
relative
difficulty
of
analysis
of
different
phonologic
subsystems
.

Of
course
,
something
of
the
same
sort
occurs
with
other
sectors
of
the
phonology
:
consonantal
articulations
have
both
a
linguistic
and
an
individual
component
.

With
tone
,
individual
differences
may
be
greater
than
the
linguistic
contrasts
which
are
superimposed
on
them
.

for
example
,
duration
sometimes
figures
in
both
the
vowel
system
and
the
intonation
.

This
explanation
of
tone
difficulties
,
however
,
does
not
apply
in
all
languages
.

In
some
(
the
Ewe
type
mentioned
above
)
interaction
of
tone
and
intonation
is
restricted
to
the
ends
of
intonation
spans
.

Still
,
even
in
such
languages
tone
analysis
has
not
been
as
simple
as
one
might
expect
.

The
design
of
orthographies
has
received
much
less
attention
from
linguists
than
the
problem
deserves
.

There
has
been
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
many
American
linguists
to
assume
that
a
phonemic
transcription
will
automatically
be
the
best
possible
orthography
and
that
the
only
real
problem
will
then
be
the
social
one
of
securing
acceptance
.

A
few
of
his
examples
are
of
very
great
interest
,
and
the
whole
discussion
of
some
importance
for
theory
.

It
exhibits
much
the
same
descriptive
technique
and
is
open
to
much
the
same
criticisms
.

There
are
more
stems
per
item
in
Athabascan
,
which
expresses
the
fact
that
the
Athabascan
languages
have
undergone
somewhat
more
change
in
diverging
from
proto-Athabascan
than
the
Yokuts
languages
from
proto-Yokuts
.

This
may
be
because
the
Athabascan
divergence
began
earlier
;
;

)
These
general
facts
are
mentioned
to
make
clear
that
the
total
situation
in
the
two
families
is
similar
enough
to
warrant
comparison
.

(
2
)
Nature
(
29
terms
against

,
ratios
3.3
versus

;
;

(
4
)
verbs
(
9
,
22
terms
)
,
ratios
4.0
versus
3.4
.

This
exception
may
be
connected
with
Hoijer's
use
of
a
much
higher
percentage
of
verbs
:
22%
of
his
total
list
as
against
3.5%
in
mine
.

which
,
divided
by
Af
gives
a
mean
of
1.07
grades
apart
.

The
actual
mean
of
1.07
being
about
halfway
between
0
of
complete
correlation
and
2.0
of
no
correlation
,
it
is
evident
that
there
is
a
pretty
fair
degree
of
similarity
in
the
behavior
even
of
particular
individual
items
of
meaning
as
regards
long-term
stem
displacement
.

His
second
conclusion
,
on
semantic
word
classes
,
agrees
with
mine
.

This
second
conclusion
,
independently
arrived
at
by
independent
study
of
material
from
two
pairs
of
language
families
as
different
and
remote
from
one
another
as
these
four
are
,
cannot
be
ignored
.

Thomas
also
presents
a
simple
equation
for
deriving
an
index
of
persistence
,
which
weights
not
only
the
number
of
stems
(
'
roots
'
)
per
meaning
,
but
their
relative
frequency
.

Thus
his
persistence
values
for
some
stem
frequencies
per
meaning
are
:
stem
identical
in
8
languages
,
100%
;
;

and
Gleason
presumably
is
on
the
way
with
a
further
contribution
in
this
area
.

The
problem
needs
further
exploration
.

or
under
'
Four
Stems
'
,
I
set
off
by
asterisks
cases
where
the
combined
N
of
stems
Af
was
Af
.

But
it
is
becoming
increasingly
evident
that
such
a
hope
is
a
snare
.

With
the
universal
list
as
his
weapon
,
Swadesh
has
extended
his
march
of
conquest
farther
and
farther
into
the
past
,
eight
,
ten
,
twelve
millennia
back
.

Some
of
this
may
prove
to
be
true
,
or
even
considerable
of
it
,
whether
by
genetic
ramification
or
by
diffusion
and
coalescence
.

but
he
has
not
worked
out
by
lexicostatistics
one
comprehensively
complete
classification
of
even
a
single
family
other
than
Salish
.

But
there
is
also
a
firm
aspect
to
lexicostatistics
:
the
aspect
of
learning
the
internal
organization
of
obvious
natural
genetic
groups
of
languages
as
well
as
their
more
remote
and
elusive
external
links
;
;

I
would
propose
,
next
,
as
the
prime
requirement
for
constitution
of
new
basic
lists
,
items
whose
forms
show
as
high
an
empirical
retention
rate
as
possible
.

Doubtless
it
was
inevitable
that
differences
of
opinion
should
arise
about
the
methods
for
applying
these
policies
.

The
West
was
now
glad
to
propose
the
1919
Curzon
Line
,
which
was
substantially
Russia's
1941
border
,
as
the
boundary
between
Russia
and
Poland
.

He
did
not
mind
the
Line
itself
,
which
Churchill
declared
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
on
February
27
,
1945
,
he
had
always
believed
to
be
just
and
right
,
but
he
did
not
want
it
called
by
a
hated
name
.

Stalin
declared
that
he
preferred
to
continue
the
war
a
little
longer
,
although
it
costs
us
blood
,
in
order
to
give
Poland
compensation
in
the
West
at
the
expense
of
the
Germans
.

After
a
prolonged
study
of
the
Oder
line
on
a
map
,
at
Teheran
,
Churchill
liked
the
picture
.

At
Yalta
he
thought
more
about
the
six
million
Germans
who
would
have
to
leave
,
trying
to
find
work
in
Germany
,
and
Roosevelt
objected
to
the
Western
Neisse
River
being
chosen
in
the
south
,
instead
of
the
Eastern
Neisse
,
both
of
which
flow
into
the
Oder
.

Of
more
importance
to
the
West
than
Poland's
boundaries
was
the
character
of
her
government
.

More
time
was
spent
in
trying
to
marry
these
incompatibles
than
over
any
subject
discussed
at
Yalta
.

Speaking
with
great
earnestness
,
he
said
:
For
the
Russian
people
,
the
question
of
Poland
is
not
only
a
question
of
honor
but
also
a
question
of
security
.

In
any
case
here
in
their
judgment
conditions
require
(
italics
added
)
they
would
form
interim
governmental
authorities
broadly
representative
of
all
democratic
elements
in
the
population
and
pledged
to
the
earliest
possible
establishment
through
free
elections
of
governments
responsive
to
the
will
of
the
people
.

Other
similar
affirmations
in
the
Declaration
on
Liberated
Europe
seemed
to
assure
democratic
institutions
on
the
Western
model
.

We
had
entertained
exaggerated
ideas
about
our
victory
automatically
establishing
our
system
throughout
the
world
.

The
same
editorial
continued
that
We
expected
to
democratize
Japan
and
Korea
and
to
see
a
new
China
pattern
itself
easily
on
our
institutions
.

Then
China
promptly
went
Communist
,
and
Mr.
Truman
had
to
fight
the
interminable
Korean
war
for
the
democratization
of
Korea
before
we
learned
how
far
our
writ
did
reach
in
Asia
.

Years
of
war
,
strain
,
and
hatred
;
;

While
the
Cold
War
raged
it
was
easy
to
blame
it
all
on
Yalta
.

When
the
Yalta
Papers
were
finally
published
with
great
fanfare
they
had
revealed
no
betrayal
by
anyone
.

An
analysis
of
the
election
falls
naturally
in
four
parts
.

The
second
major
aspect
of
the
election
is
the
actual
procedure
of
registration
,
nomination
and
voting
.

The
electoral
procedure
prevented
the
ready
identification
of
party
affiliation
,
but
all
vitally
interested
parties
,
including
the
government
itself
,
were
busily
engaged
in
determining
the
party
identifications
of
all
successful
candidates
the
month
following
the
elections
.

The
fourth
and
concluding
point
will
be
to
estimate
the
long-run
significance
of
the
elections
and
how
they
figure
in
the
current
pattern
of
internal
politics
.

Elections
have
figured
prominently
in
nearly
every
government
program
and
official
address
since
independence
.

Since
the
complicated
process
of
establishing
new
communes
and
reviewing
the
rudimentary
plan
left
by
the
French
did
not
even
begin
until
the
fall
of
1957
,
this
goal
appears
somewhat
ambitious
.

From
the
very
beginning
the
electoral
discussions
raised
fundamental
issues
in
Moroccan
politics
,
precisely
the
type
of
questions
that
were
most
difficult
to
resolve
in
the
new
government
.

There
were
rumors
that
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
favored
an
arbitrary
,
non-political
process
,
which
were
indirectly
affirmed
when
the
King
personally
intervened
in
the
planned
meetings
.

The
day
following
his
intervention
the
palace
issued
a
statement
reassuring
the
citizens
that
the
possibility
of
introducing
appeals
concerning
the
establishment
of
electoral
lists
,
lists
of
candidates
and
finally
the
holding
of
the
consultation
itself
would
be
supported
by
the
King
himself
.

Despite
the
internal
and
international
crises
that
harassed
Morocco
the
elections
remained
a
central
issue
.

But
the
eagerly
sought
homogeneity
of
the
Balafrej
Council
of
Government
was
never
achieved
as
the
Istiqlal
quarreled
over
foreign
policy
,
labor
politics
and
economic
development
.

By
December
,
1958
,
when
'
Abdallah
Ibrahim
became
President
of
the
Council
,
elections
had
even
greater
importance
.

By
this
time
there
is
little
doubt
but
what
election
plans
were
complete
.

The
choice
of
the
single
member
district
was
dictated
to
a
certain
extent
by
problems
of
communication
and
understanding
in
the
more
remote
areas
of
the
country
,
but
it
also
served
to
minimize
the
national
political
value
of
the
elections
.

Although
the
elections
were
for
local
officials
,
it
was
not
necessary
to
conduct
the
elections
so
as
to
prevent
parties
from
publicly
identifying
their
candidates
.

Both
parties
and
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
were
busily
at
work
after
the
elections
trying
to
unearth
the
political
affiliations
of
the
successful
candidates
and
,
thereby
,
give
the
elections
a
confidential
but
known
degree
of
national
political
significance
.

The
concentration
of
effective
power
in
Rabat
leads
not
only
to
party
bickering
,
but
to
distraction
from
local
activity
that
might
have
had
many
auxiliary
benefits
in
addition
to
contributing
to
more
meaningful
elections
.

As
the
more
conservative
group
with
strong
backing
from
wealthy
businessmen
,
the
U.M.C.I.A.
was
generally
favored
against
the
more
progressive
,
labor-based
U.N.F.P.
.

The
sine
qua
non
of
the
elections
was
naturally
an
impartial
and
standardized
procedure
.

A
goal
was
fixed
,
as
given
in
Table
2
,
and
attention
focused
on
its
fulfillment
.

The
police
were
disqualified
along
with
certain
categories
of
naturalized
citizens
,
criminals
and
those
punished
for
Protectorate
activities
.

Some
vocational
training
schools
provide
such
training
,
but
the
current
need
exceeds
the
facilities
.

Annual
authorizations
of
$15
million
were
added
for
area
vocational
education
programs
that
meet
national
defense
needs
for
highly
skilled
technicians
.

During
World
War
2
,
about
7.5
million
persons
were
enrolled
in
courses
organized
under
two
special
programs
administered
by
state
and
local
school
authorities
:
(
1
)
Vocational
Education
for
National
Defense
,
and
(
2
)
War
Production
Training
.

A
recent
study
indicated
that
85
per
cent
of
the
nation's
largest
corporations
conducted
educational
programs
involving
some
class
meetings
and
examinations
.

An
important
recent
trend
is
the
development
of
area
vocational
schools
.

These
schools
are
intended
to
provide
the
facilities
and
specialized
curriculum
that
would
not
be
possible
for
very
small
school
districts
.

Planning
of
vocational
education
programs
and
courses
is
oriented
to
local
employer
needs
for
trained
workers
.

Furthermore
,
there
is
a
cautious
conservatism
on
the
part
of
those
making
local
skill
surveys
.

While
the
U.
S.
Department
of
Labor
has
a
program
of
projecting
industry
and
occupational
employment
trends
and
publishing
current
outlook
statements
,
there
is
little
tangible
evidence
that
these
projections
have
been
used
extensively
in
local
curriculum
planning
.

The
U.
S.
Office
of
Education
continues
to
stress
local
surveys
rather
than
national
surveys
.

No
effort
is
made
in
the
same
studies
to
present
information
on
regional
or
national
demand
trends
in
these
skills
or
to
consider
whether
regional
or
national
demands
for
other
skills
might
provide
much
better
opportunities
for
the
youth
to
be
trained
.

There
simply
is
not
enough
material
available
on
the
types
of
job
skills
that
are
in
demand
and
the
types
of
training
programs
that
are
required
or
most
suitable
.

If
there
is
adequate
information
on
job
opportunities
for
skilled
jobs
elsewhere
,
many
more
workers
can
be
expected
to
respond
.

A
further
possibility
is
suggested
by
the
example
of
the
G.
I.
bills
and
also
by
some
recent
trends
in
attitudes
toward
improving
college
education
:
that
is
to
provide
financial
assistance
to
individuals
for
vocational
training
when
local
facilities
are
inadequate
.

Instead
of
being
limited
to
the
poor
training
facilities
in
remote
areas
,
the
student
would
be
able
to
move
to
large
institutions
of
concentrated
specialized
training
.

His
aptitudes
and
preferences
could
be
given
more
weight
in
selecting
the
proper
training
.

Then
the
fact
that
the
lower
channel
line
was
pierced
had
further
forecasting
significance
.

And
then
the
application
of
the
count
rules
to
the
width
(
horizontally
)
of
the
configuration
gives
us
an
intial
estimate
of
the
probable
depth
of
the
decline
.

But
there
is
no
positive
and
consistently
demonstrable
relationship
in
the
strictest
sense
.

Experience
will
show
that
only
the
vaguest
generalities
apply
,
and
in
fine
,
these
merely
dwell
upon
a
relationship
between
the
durations
and
intensities
of
events
.

Even
if
we
strip
their
respective
claims
to
the
barest
minimum
,
the
odds
still
favor
them
both
,
for
the
trend
in
effect
is
always
more
likely
to
continue
than
to
reverse
.

Much
of
this
goes
on
in
offices
high
up
in
Wall
Street's
lofty
wind-swept
towers
.

We
mentioned
odd-lot
indices
a
few
paragraphs
ago
.

Which
came
first
?
?

Is
it
really
that
the
public
buys
at
the
tops
,
and
not
that
the
market
tops
out
when
the
public
buys
?
?

This
element
is
often
called
strong
hands
.

When
strong
hands
buy
,
they
are
able
to
buy
more
,
and
they
do
it
even
in
the
face
of
bearish
news
reports
.

Certain
badly
disillusioned
market
critics
are
often
apt
to
feel
that
there
is
something
somehow
unfair
,
dirty
,
or
even
thoroughly
criminal
about
this
interplay
of
competitive
forces
.

How
much
and
how
many
profits
could
a
majority
take
out
of
the
losses
of
a
few
?
?

Membership
in
the
echelons
fluctuates
too
.

The
usefulness
of
this
study
and
of
configuration
analysis
as
well
,
declines
in
direct
proportion
to
the
dissemination
of
its
use
.

Mr.
John
Magee
,
whose
work
has
been
discussed
in
this
chapter
,
was
quoted
in
a
New
Yorker
Magazine
profile
as
saying
:
Of
course
,
you
have
to
remember
it's
a
good
thing
for
us
chartists
that
there
aren't
more
of
us
.

Nevertheless
,
all
theories
and
techniques
lead
but
to
one
of
two
possible
modes
of
expression
,
if
they
lead
to
a
market
committment
at
all
.

Though
the
methods
of
deciding
may
be
profound
and
diverse
,
the
possible
conclusions
remain
but
two
.

In
assessing
the
outlook
for
interest
rates
in
1961
,
the
question
,
as
always
,
is
the
prospect
for
general
business
activity
.

What
does
the
general
business
outlook
suggest
about
the
trend
of
long-term
rates
in
1961
?
?

It
seems
likely
,
moreover
,
that
with
an
increase
in
the
rate
of
saving
in
mortgage
lending
institutions
,
interest
rates
on
residential
mortgages
may
move
somewhat
lower
through
the
spring
of
next
year
,
although
the
increased
ease
in
residential
mortgage
lending
may
occur
primarily
in
other
terms
than
interest
rate
,
e.g.
,
easier
downpayment
and
amortization
terms
.

However
,
the
monetary
authorities
will
continue
to
be
required
to
pay
attention
to
the
consequences
of
their
actions
with
respect
to
our
international
balance
of
payments
position
and
the
outflow
of
gold
,
as
well
as
with
regard
to
avoiding
the
creation
of
excessive
liquidity
in
the
economy
,
which
would
delay
the
effectiveness
of
monetary
policy
measures
in
the
next
expansion
phase
of
the
business
cycle
.

Moreover
,
it
is
likely
that
Federal
policies
aimed
at
stimulating
a
faster
rate
of
economic
growth
of
the
country
,
to
keep
ahead
of
the
Communist
countries
and
to
demonstrate
that
our
free
economic
system
is
better
than
theirs
,
will
lead
to
rising
Federal
spending
in
certain
areas
such
as
education
,
housing
,
medical
aid
,
and
the
like
.

Here
would
be
a
powerful
force
for
raising
business
activity
.

While
there
may
be
several
such
industries
to
which
the
model
of
this
paper
is
applicable
,
the
authors
make
particular
claim
of
relevance
to
the
explanation
of
the
course
of
wages
and
prices
in
the
steel
industry
of
the
United
States
since
World
War
2
.

Where
the
industry's
product
price
has
been
kept
below
the
profit-maximizing
and
entry-limiting
prices
due
to
fears
of
public
reaction
,
the
profit
seeking
producers
have
an
interest
in
offering
little
real
resistance
to
wage
demands
.

Part
2
,
discusses
the
operation
of
the
model
and
derives
some
significant
conclusions
.

The
demand
for
the
industry's
product

For
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
,
the
problem
of
relative
prices
is
encompassed
in
these
two
variables
,
since
GNP
includes
other
prices
.

Because
of
its
importance
,
and
because
the
lack
of
price
competition
is
well
recognized
,
the
industry
is
under
considerable
public
pressure
not
to
raise
its
price
any
more
than
could
be
justified
by
cost
increases
.

For
the
industry
of
this
model
,
the
effect
of
such
public
pressures
in
the
past
has
been
to
hold
the
price
well
below
the
short-run
profit-maximizing
price
(
given
the
wage
rate
and
the
level
of
GNP
)
,
and
even
below
the
entry-limited
price
(
but
not
below
average
cost
)
.

Thus
,
if
public
pressure
sets
the
effective
limit
to
the
price
that
the
industry
may
charge
,
this
pressure
is
itself
a
function
of
the
wage
rate
.

Where
this
approach
becomes
critical
,
the
industry
can
be
expected
to
put
much
emphasis
on
this
as
evidence
of
its
sincerity
in
resisting
the
wage
pressures
of
a
powerful
union
,
requesting
tariff
relief
after
it
has
reluctantly
acceded
to
the
union
pressure
.

The
extent
to
which
the
public-limit
price
is
raised
by
a
given
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
is
itself
a
function
of
three
things
:
the
passage
of
time
,
the
level
of
GNP
,
and
the
size
of
the
wage
increase
.

We
are
abstracting
from
the
fact
of
strikes
here
,
but
it
should
be
obvious
that
the
extent
to
which
the
public-limit
price
is
raised
by
a
given
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
is
also
a
function
of
the
show
of
resistance
put
up
by
the
industry
.

Public
indignation
and
resistance
to
wage-price
increases
is
obviously
much
less
when
the
increases
are
on
the
order
of
3%
per
annum
than
when
the
increases
are
on
the
order
of
3%
per
month
.

Notice
,
however
,
that
the
passage
of
time
does
not
permit
the
raising
of
prices
per
se
,
without
an
accompanying
wage
increase
.

The
union
does
not
regard
unemployment
of
its
own
members
as
a
matter
of
concern
when
setting
its
own
wage
policy
--
its
concern
with
employment
makes
itself
felt
in
pressure
upon
the
government
to
maintain
full
employment
.

For
our
present
purposes
we
assume
that
the
sole
subject
of
bargaining
is
the
basic
wage
rate
(
not
including
productivity
improvement
factors
or
cost-of-living
adjustments
)
,
and
it
is
this
basic
wage
rate
which
determines
the
level
of
costs
.

The
existence
of
conflict
and
of
vigorous
union
demand
for
an
increase
in
money
wages
does
not
contradict
the
assumption
that
the
union
is
willing
to
settle
for
cost-of-living
and
productivity-share
increases
as
distinct
from
a
cost-raising
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
.

We
assume
further
that
the
union
recognizes
the
possibility
that
price-level
increases
may
offset
wage-rate
increases
,
and
it
does
not
entirely
disregard
the
effect
of
price
increases
arising
from
its
own
wage
increases
upon
the
real
wage
rate
.

Essentially
this
imposed
two
conditions
:
First
,
international
law
had
to
recognize
and
be
compatible
with
an
international
political
system
in
which
a
number
of
states
were
competitive
,
suspicious
,
and
opportunistic
in
their
political
alignments
with
one
another
;
;

On
the
one
hand
,
the
major
European
nations
had
to
maintain
vis-a-vis
each
other
an
emphasis
upon
sovereignty
,
independence
,
formal
equality
--
thus
insuring
for
themselves
individually
an
optimal
freedom
of
action
to
maintain
the
flexibility
of
alignment
that
the
system
required
and
to
avoid
anything
approaching
a
repetition
of
the
disastrous
Napoleonic
experience
.

A
nation
such
as
Switzerland
could
be
neutralized
by
agreement
and
could
be
relied
upon
to
protect
its
neutrality
;
;

out
of
the
question
was
the
neutralization
of
Asia
and
Africa
.

This
Europeanization
of
the
law
was
made
explicit
by
a
number
of
19th
century
scholars
.

More
emphasis
was
put
upon
the
fact
that
international
law
was
the
law
of
civilized
nations
;
;

Now
,
with
virtually
every
writer
,
not
only
was
the
European
origin
of
public
law
acknowledged
as
a
historical
phenomenon
,
but
the
rules
thus
established
by
the
advanced
civilizations
of
Europe
were
to
be
imposed
on
others
.

his
search
was
merely
for
rules
that
might
limit
his
freedom
of
action
.

In
the
international
community
this
reduced
law
to
Jellinek's
auto-limitation
.

he
could
be
subjected
to
law
only
because
he
agreed
to
be
.

Hidden
behind
Hegelian
abstractions
were
more
practical
reasons
for
a
changing
jurisprudence
.

Increased
participation
in
politics
and
the
demands
of
various
groups
for
status
and
recognition
had
dramatic
effects
upon
law
institutions
.

Law
became
a
conscious
process
,
something
more
than
simply
doing
justice
and
looking
to
local
customs
and
a
common
morality
for
applicable
norms
.

Codification
was
followed
in
all
countries
by
a
growing
amount
of
legislation
,
some
changing
and
adjusting
the
older
law
,
much
dealing
with
entirely
new
situations
.

Indeed
,
contract
was
the
dominant
legal
theme
of
the
century
,
the
touchstone
of
the
free
society
.

Government
itself
was
based
upon
contract
;
;

The
displacement
(
at
least
to
a
considerable
extent
)
of
the
ethical
jurisprudence
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
by
positivism
reshaped
both
international
law
theory
and
doctrine
.

In
the
first
place
the
new
doctrine
brought
a
formal
separation
of
international
from
municipal
law
,
rejecting
the
earlier
view
that
both
were
parts
of
a
universal
legal
system
.

One
result
was
to
nationalize
much
that
had
been
regarded
as
the
law
of
nations
.

Then
in
1875
,
apparently
in
response
to
the
nationalizing
influence
of
the
Civil
War
,
Congress
first
gave
the
lower
federal
courts
general
authority
--
concurrently
with
state
tribunals
--
to
decide
cases
involving
federal-right
questions
.

This
saved
for
state
adjudication
,
in
the
first
instance
,
the
two
major
areas
where
federal
injunctions
had
been
most
obnoxious
,
but
other
areas
remained
vulnerable
.

The
classic
case
is
Railroad
Commission
v.
Pullman
.

The
commission
had
issued
an
administrative
order
which
was
challenged
as
discriminatory
against
Negroes
.

In
Alabama
Public
Service
Commission
v.
Southern
Ry.
Co.
,
the
commission
had
refused
to
permit
abandonment
of
certain
uneconomic
train
facilities
.

it
does
not
establish
any
law
(
rights
)
for
the
federal
judges
to
enforce
.

How
can
judges
exercise
jurisdiction
to
enforce
national
rights
when
Congress
has
created
none
?
?

The
Justice's
elaborate
examination
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
provision
in
question
suggests
that
Congress'
purpose
was
merely
to
make
unions
suable
.

To
avoid
these
constitutional
difficulties
,
Mr.
Justice
Frankfurter
was
prepared
to
read
the
Taft-Hartley
provision
as
concerned
with
diversity
,
rather
than
federal
question
,
jurisdiction
.

(
As
we
have
seen
,
the
Erie
and
York
decisions
require
federal
courts
in
diversity
cases
to
follow
state
decisional
rules
.

Does
Lincoln
Mills
suggest
that
if
Congress
granted
jurisdiction
over
interstate
divorce
cases
,
the
federal
courts
would
be
authorized
to
fashion
a
national
law
for
the
dissolution
of
marriages
?
?

It
would
also
probably
mean
different
things
within
the
same
state
--
depending
upon
what
court
(
state
or
federal
)
rendered
decision
.

In
an
FELA
controversy
the
state
court
followed
established
state
procedure
by
construing
a
vague
complaint
most
strongly
against
the
complainant
.

Here
,
as
in
the
Byrd
case
,
another
element
of
state
procedure
was
subsumed
to
federal
judge-made
law
.

Another
problem
in
the
area
of
federal-state
relationships
is
this
:
what
constitutes
reversible
error
in
a
state
decision
?
?

The
conduct
in
question
was
a
speech
.

How
else
can
one
explain
,
for
example
,
allowing
the
survival
of
the
right
to
amortize
bond
discount
and
premium
(
section
381(c)(9)
)
,
but
not
the
right
to
amortize
bond
issue
expenses
;
;

or
allowing
a
deduction
for
payment
of
certain
obligations
of
a
transferor
assumed
in
the
reorganization
(
section
381(c)(16)
)
,
but
not
a
deduction
for
theft
losses
sustained
by
a
transferor
prior
to
a
reorganization
but
discovered
after
it
;
;

These
items
,
and
most
of
the
others
listed
above
,
seem
quite
comparable
to
items
whose
right
of
survival
is
provided
for
in
section
381
.

There
does
not
seem
to
be
any
reasonable
basis
for
distinction
either
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
the
tax
attribute
or
in
terms
of
tax-avoidance
possibilities
.

furthermore
,
Congress
could
not
be
presumed
to
have
intended
to
obstruct
mergers
approved
by
the
states
.

Exceptions
are
often
classified
as
transfers
by
operation
of
law
.

In
substance
,
said
the
Court
,
there
was
no
transfer
of
equitable
title
.

if
the
succession
is
not
of
record
,
all
documents
relating
to
such
succession
,
properly
certified
,
are
required
.

The
former
proof
seems
applicable
to
a
statutory
merger
or
consolidation
,
the
latter
to
a
contractual
acquisition
.

The
Ruling
would
not
,
however
,
apply
to
an
acquisition
of
assets
for
cash
.

The
Ruling
suggests
also
that
it
applies
to
either
a
statutory
or
contractual
reorganization
.

Hence
,
a
successor
corporation
in
a
C
reorganization
appears
entitled
to
sue
for
a
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
the
merged
corporation
despite
section
203
.

For
example
,
property
used
in
the
trade
or
business
of
a
transferor
corporation
,
as
defined
in
section
1231
,
presumably
would
not
retain
its
special
status
following
a
non-taxable
reorganization
if
it
is
not
so
used
in
the
business
of
the
acquiring
corporation
.

Section
169
permits
a
person
acquiring
grain-storage
facilities
to
elect
to
continue
amortization
over
a
60-month
period
.

For
example
,
suppose
another
excess
profits
tax
similar
to
prior
laws
is
enacted
,
providing
for
carryover
of
excess
profits
credits
.

Under
the
1939
Code
this
item
was
permitted
to
survive
a
tax-free
reorganization
in
the
Stanton
Brewery
case
,
but
only
over
the
dissent
of
Judge
Learned
Hand
,
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
in
the
Sansome
case
,
a
leading
case
requiring
carryover
of
earnings
and
profits
in
a
non-taxable
reorganization
.

With
respect
to
this
type
of
item
,
one
might
properly
apply
the
language
of
the
Committee
Report
,
quoted
above
,
which
cautions
against
using
section
381
as
a
basis
for
treating
other
tax
attributes
not
mentioned
therein
.

Actually
,
there
do
not
presently
appear
to
be
items
in
the
statute
comparable
to
a
net
operating
loss
carryover
.

There
were
two
methods
that
could
have
been
used
for
conducting
the
study
within
the
resources
available
:
(
1
)
interviews
in
depth
with
a
few
selected
companies
,
and
(
2
)
the
more
limited
interrogation
of
a
large
number
of
companies
by
means
of
a
mail
questionnaire
.

While
the
method
of
interviewing
a
small
number
of
companies
was
appealing
because
of
the
opportunity
it
might
have
furnished
to
probe
fully
the
reasons
and
circumstances
of
a
company's
practices
and
opinions
,
it
also
involved
the
risk
of
paying
undue
attention
to
the
unique
and
peculiar
problems
of
just
a
few
individual
companies
.

It
is
recognized
that
a
mail
questionnaire
has
inherent
limitations
.

Is
the
respondent
making
a
recommendation
for
his
own
benefit
,
for
the
benefit
of
his
industry
,
for
the
benefit
of
a
specific
government
department
or
service
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
defense
program
,
for
the
benefit
of
small
business
,
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayers
?
?

Under
the
circumstances
,
however
,
the
team
considered
it
would
provide
the
most
useful
information
at
this
point
.

In
the
preparation
of
the
questionnaire
the
problems
noted
above
were
carefully
considered
,
and
the
structure
and
phraseology
used
were
designed
to
minimize
the
effects
of
these
limitations
.

(
2
)
the
actual
selling
and
buying
practices
of
the
respondents
;
;

Accordingly
,
another
test
of
the
questionaire
was
made
.

Fifty
of
the
100
firms
were
selected
on
a
random
basis
from
3,500
names
submitted
by
member
companies
of
the
Aerospace
Industries
Association
(
AIA
list
)
and
fifty
were
selected
in
a
similar
manner
from
a
list
of
1,500
names
compiled
by
the
research
team
from
the
Thomas
Register
(
TR
list
)
.

The
remaining
names
were
then
checked
against
the
Thomas
Register
list
(
see
below
)
and
duplicate
names
were
removed
from
the
AIA
lists
.

By
these
steps
the
final
AIA
list
was
reduced
from
8,000
to
3,500
.

The
third
list
was
selected
by
the
research
team
on
a
random
basis
from
the
Thomas
Register
.

Fifteen
hundred
names
were
selected
in
this
fashion
.

Each
letter
contained
a
postage-prepaid
return
envelope
by
regular
mail
for
addresses
in
the
Pacific
Northwest
,
and
by
airmail
for
those
outside
the
Pacific
Northwest
.

All
responses
,
except
comments
,
were
numerically
coded
to
permit
use
of
data-processing
equipment
.

The
codes
were
key-punched
into
IBM
punch
cards
and
verified
.

The
cards
were
then
processed
using
standard
IBM
punch
card
equipment
,
including
an
IBM
650
computer
.

During
the
summer
of
1960
,
it
became
the
setting
for
a
bitter
and
basic
labor-management
struggle
.

The
contestants
in
this
economic
struggle
are
the
Agricultural
Workers
Organizing
Committee
(
AWOC
)
of
the
AFL-CIO
and
the
agricultural
employers
of
the
State
.

It
is
disconcerting
,
nevertheless
,
to
read
in
a
labor
weekly
,
Perluss
knuckles
down
to
growers
,
and
then
to
be
confronted
with
a
growers'
publication
which
states
,
Perluss
recognizes
obviously
phony
and
trumped-up
strikes
as
bona
fide
.

As
a
result
of
these
changed
conditions
,
the
impact
of
the
organizational
effort
on
agricultural
labor-management
relations
has
been
much
greater
than
in
the
past
.

The
AWOC
has
been
able
to
employ
the
traditional
weapons
of
labor
--
the
strike
and
the
picket
line
--
with
considerable
success
,
particularly
in
the
area
of
wages
.

By
the
very
nature
of
the
situation
,
it
is
the
union
which
has
been
able
to
select
the
time
and
place
to
bring
pressure
upon
management
.

To
date
,
at
least
,
the
strategy
of
the
AWOC
has
been
selective
;
;

The
pertinent
regulation
for
our
purposes
is
Section
602.2
(
,
)
,
as
follows
:

It
permits
referrals
under
certain
circumstances
even
when
there
is
a
labor
dispute
,
provided
the
individual
is
given
written
notice
of
such
a
dispute
.

Assume
,
for
example
,
a
situation
where
a
farm
has
a
packing
shed
and
fields
.

The
packing
shed
workers
go
on
strike
.

So
far
,
no
troublesome
cases
have
arisen
under
this
provision
.

Note
that
it
prohibits
referrals
under
either
condition
(
1
)
or
condition
(
2
)
.

Accordingly
,
under
clause
(
1
)
of
the
Secretary's
Regulation
,
we
suspended
referrals
to
the
employer
.

(
Incidentally
,
no
Mexican
nationals
were
involved
.

A
similar
case
arose
at
the
Bowers
ranch
in
Butte
County
,
and
the
Superior
Court
of
that
county
issued
similar
restraining
orders
.

It
is
not
binding
upon
another
Superior
Court
,
which
could
rule
to
the
contrary
.

In
that
event
,
we
can
correctly
say
that
we
have
received
an
authoritative
interpretation
of
the
matter
,
and
one
which
we
can
follow
statewide
with
confidence
that
the
policy
will
not
be
overthrown
in
other
Superior
Courts
.

The
Attorney
General
of
the
United
States
,
in
considering
the
power
of
the
Secretary
to
issue
similar
regulations
under
the
Wagner-Peyser
Act
relating
to
the
interstate
recruitment
of
farm
workers
,
has
rendered
an
opinion
sustaining
his
authority
.

Next
,
let
us
consider
briefly
the
program
and
administrative
implications
of
a
failure
on
our
part
to
pursue
our
appeals
.

There
is
far
too
much
at
stake
for
all
of
the
parties
concerned
to
leave
the
matter
hanging
in
midair
.

The
ramifications
of
the
issue
are
enormous
.

A
decision
to
refer
workers
to
jobs
vacant
because
of
a
strike
would
have
to
be
applied
equally
to
nonagricultural
situations
,
and
might
in
effect
place
the
public
employment
services
in
the
position
of
acting
as
strikebreakers
.

Thus
far
,
the
cases
which
have
come
before
the
courts
have
involved
only
the
issue
of
referral
where
the
job
is
vacant
due
to
a
strike
--
condition
(
1
)
in
the
Regulation
of
the
Secretary
.

Should
it
be
defined
in
a
narrow
sense
to
include
only
such
elements
as
job
specifications
,
union
membership
,
union
jurisdiction
,
and
the
like
?
?

Because
of
the
uncertainty
of
this
definition
,
I
solicited
the
interpretation
of
the
Secretary
of
Labor
.

He
has
advised
me
that
the
narrower
interpretation
is
the
proper
one
;
;

After
they
have
developed
concepts
,
they
are
free
from
the
necessity
of
manipulating
objects
;
;

One
experiment
showed
the
greatest
one-year
difference
occurring
between
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
years
.

Many
studies
indicate
that
elementary-school
children's
interests
cover
the
whole
field
of
science
;
;

How
a
child
feels
about
himself
,
about
other
people
,
and
about
the
tasks
confronting
him
in
school
may
have
as
much
influence
on
his
success
in
school
as
his
physical
and
intellectual
characteristics
.

As
the
child
grows
older
,
his
emotional
reactions
lead
to
moods
,
or
emotional
states
drawn
out
over
a
period
of
time
and
expressed
slowly
,
rather
than
in
short
,
abrupt
outbursts
.

The
young
child
learns
from
parents
and
teachers
that
temper
tantrums
,
screaming
,
kicking
,
and
hitting
will
not
get
him
what
he
wants
;
;

the
older
child
learns
that
intense
emotional
outbursts
will
not
win
approval
by
his
peers
,
and
,
therefore
,
makes
a
real
effort
to
control
his
emotions
.

Among
infants
the
patterns
of
emotional
responses
are
similar
;
;

the
child
who
had
once
considered
it
a
treat
to
accompany
his
parents
on
picnics
and
family
gatherings
now
considers
it
a
bore
.

such
factors
as
sex
,
intelligence
,
and
status
in
the
group
do
not
influence
his
choice
much
at
this
time
.

In
later
childhood
,
an
interest
in
team
games
replaces
individual
play
;
;

those
who
feel
inferior
or
insecure
engage
in
these
activities
more
than
do
well-adjusted
children
.

By
the
time
pupils
reach
the
sixth
grade
,
their
ethical
and
moral
standards
are
fairly
well
developed
;
;

he
wants
to
be
with
people
,
but
he
hasn't
yet
learned
to
cooperate
.

These
specialists
perform
valuable
services
by
helping
teachers
learn
to
identify
children
who
need
special
attention
,
by
suggesting
ways
of
meeting
the
needs
of
individual
children
in
the
regular
classroom
,
and
by
providing
clinical
services
for
severely
maladjusted
children
.

Teachers
and
administrators
in
many
elementary
schools
have
assumed
that
dividing
the
pupils
in
any
grade
into
groups
on
the
basis
of
test
scores
solves
the
problem
of
meeting
the
needs
of
individuals
.

Although
the
teacher
must
be
concerned
with
maintaining
standards
,
he
must
also
be
concerned
about
understanding
differences
in
ability
,
background
,
and
experience
.

Studies
conducted
in
various
sections
of
the
United
States
indicate
that
many
children
in
elementary
schools
are
maladjusted
emotionally
,
and
that
many
of
them
are
failing
to
make
satisfactory
progress
in
school
subjects
.

These
maladjustments
in
turn
inhibit
learning
,
and
a
vicious
cycle
is
completed
.

They
may
be
caused
by
poor
health
habits
,
such
as
faulty
eating
and
sleeping
habits
.

Moreover
,
these
conditions
do
not
influence
all
children
in
the
same
manner
.

A
vision
handicap
that
may
produce
nervous
tension
and
reading
disability
for
one
child
may
spur
another
child
on
to
even
greater
achievement
in
reading
.

This
section
deals
with
some
of
the
sources
of
information
that
can
be
tapped
by
the
classroom
teacher
;
;

These
records
,
when
systematically
maintained
,
provide
much
information
about
the
children
,
which
the
teacher
can
use
in
guidance
,
instruction
,
grouping
,
and
reporting
to
parents
.

Only
the
teacher
and
other
professional
personnel
are
permitted
to
see
or
use
these
records
.

Each
new
teacher
to
whom
the
pupil
goes
is
expected
to
study
the
information
in
the
cumulative
record
and
to
bring
it
up
to
date
.

The
Summary
Report
,
which
was
prepared
for
this
Conference
,
indicates
,
first
,
that
actual
or
pending
school
desegregation
is
increasing
;
;

The
Middle-South
Region
,
as
defined
by
the
National
Association
of
Intergroup
Relations
Officials
(
NAIRO
)
,
consists
of
the
states
of
Kentucky
,
Maryland
,
Tennessee
,
West
Virginia
,
Delaware
,
Virginia
and
the
District
of
Columbia
.

but
the
region
also
embraces
some
of
the
staunchest
opposition
.

Desegregation
and
court
order

Elementary
school
desegregation
came
to
Owen
and
Union
Counties
,
which
already
had
high
school
desegregation
.

In
Maryland
the
Harford
County
Board
of
Education
had
prepared
a
desegregation
plan
which
the
Court
approved
but
which
a
plaintiff
had
challenged
;
;

that
on
the
immediate
horizon
,
if
further
large-scale
(
relatively
speaking
)
desegregation
comes
,
it
will
result
from
court
orders
on
suits
filed
in
several
Middle-South
states
.

That
reference
in
the
Report
is
continuation
of
the
trend
toward
an
all-Negro
school
system
,
a
remark
apparently
occasioned
by
the
increase
of
Negro
school
population
from
74.1
per
cent
to
76.7
per
cent
.

West
of
Rock
Creek
Park
is
still
monolithically
white
and
is
in
fact
increasingly
white
as
a
result
of
Georgetown's
conversion-by-renovation
housing
program
.

First
,
how
can
we
step
up
the
desegregation
movement
?
?

Second
,
as
we
increase
the
number
of
desegregated
school
districts
and
schools
themselves
,
how
can
we
achieve
this
action
through
school
board
action
?
?

not
whether
it
should
be
done
.

On
the
one
hand
do
we
argue
the
Supreme
Court
decision
required
only
that
a
child
not
be
denied
admission
to
a
school
on
account
of
his
race
?
?

The
earlier
part
of
my
statement
deals
with
the
court
orders
that
resulted
in
desegregation
.

Is
the
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
be
a
person
actually
denied
admission
to
a
school
a
sound
requirement
?
?

Should
Congress
authorize
the
Attorney
General
to
file
suit
to
accomplish
admission
of
a
child
to
a
school
to
which
he
is
denied
entrance
?
?

Even
though
in
civil
rights
legislation
in
1957
and
1960
the
provision
for
the
Attorney
General
to
act
was
eliminated
,
should
we
nevertheless
support
such
a
clause
?
?

This
is
an
issue
,
for
it
divides
people
rather
sharply
.

Should
we
support
a
clause
in
Federal
school
construction
or
school
assistance
legislation
that
would
deny
Federal
funds
to
a
school
district
that
denies
admission
to
a
child
on
account
of
his
race
?
?

Nearly
half
the
children
still
receive
no
education
.

The
next
question
is
whether
board
members
favor
their
own
social
classes
in
their
roles
as
educational
policy-makers
.

If
there
were
more
such
cases
,
it
would
be
easier
to
answer
the
question
whether
the
policy-makers
favor
their
own
social
classes
.

There
is
currently
a
major
controversy
of
public
education
in
which
group
interests
and
values
are
heavily
engaged
.

Thus
,
the
white
middle
and
lower
classes
are
arrayed
against
the
Negro
middle
and
lower
classes
.

The
problem
arises
,
if
it
does
arise
,
when
the
educator
has
to
make
a
choice
or
a
decision
within
the
area
of
his
professional
competence
,
but
which
bears
some
relation
to
the
social
structure
.

One
social-class
factor
which
plays
a
large
part
in
educational
policy
today
is
the
fact
that
a
great
many
school
and
college
teachers
are
upward
mobile
from
urban
lower-class
and
lower-middle-class
families
.

Teachers
who
have
been
upward
mobile
probably
see
education
as
most
valuable
for
their
students
if
it
serves
students
as
it
has
served
them
;
;

that
is
,
they
are
likely
to
favor
a
kind
of
education
that
has
vocational-advancement
value
.

But
another
cause
may
lie
in
the
experience
of
so
many
new
postwar
faculty
members
with
their
own
use
of
education
as
a
means
of
social
advancement
.

Their
experience
is
quite
in
contrast
with
that
of
children
of
upper-
and
upper-middle-class
native-born
parents
,
who
are
more
likely
to
regard
education
as
good
for
its
own
sake
and
to
discount
the
vocational
emphases
in
the
curriculum
.

The
public
interest
groups

They
generally
vote
so
as
to
serve
their
own
constituency
,
and
if
the
constituency
should
be
solidly
middle
class
or
solidly
lower
class
,
they
might
be
expected
to
vote
and
work
for
middle-
or
for
lower-class
interests
in
education
.

President
Truman's
Commission
on
Higher
Education
tended
to
take
a
liberal
,
expansionist
position
,
while
President
Eisenhower's
Committee
on
Education
Beyond
the
High
School
was
slightly
more
conservative
.

Finally
there
are
the
parent
organizations
and
the
laymen's
organizations
such
as
the
National
Association
of
Parents
and
Teachers
,
and
the
Citizens
Committee
on
Public
Schools
.

Attempts
to
influence
social
structure
through
education

Both
of
these
purposes
exist
side
by
side
without
much
overt
conflict
under
present
conditions
.

Maximizing
economic
and
cultural
opportunity

The
recent
federal
government's
student-loan
program
is
another
step
in
the
direction
of
making
higher
education
more
available
to
lower-status
youth
.

It
is
probably
more
effective
than
the
expanded
scholarship
programs
of
the
past
decade
,
because
the
scholarship
programs
mainly
aided
the
students
with
the
best
academic
records
(
who
were
usually
middle-class
)
,
and
these
students
tended
to
use
the
scholarship
funds
to
go
to
more
expensive
colleges
.

One
such
disagreement
,
which
will
receive
attention
in
this
next
chapter
,
concerns
the
question
whether
rates
for
different
kinds
of
service
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
attribute
of
discrimination
,
must
be
made
directly
proportional
to
marginal
costs
,
or
whether
they
should
be
based
instead
on
differences
in
marginal
costs
.

Two
major
types
of
fully
distributed
cost
analysis

Nevertheless
,
because
the
Cost
Section
has
felt
impelled
to
make
some
kind
of
a
distribution
of
total
costs
,
it
has
apportioned
this
residue
,
which
it
sometimes
calls
burden
,
among
the
units
of
carload
traffic
on
a
basis
(
partly
ton
,
partly
ton-mile
)
which
is
concededly
quite
arbitrary
from
the
standpoint
of
cost
determination
.

In
recent
years
,
this
burden
(
which
includes
allowances
for
revenue
deficiencies
in
the
passenger
business
and
in
less-than-carload
freight
traffic
!
!

Since
this
book
is
concerned
only
incidentally
with
railroad
rates
,
it
will
not
attempt
to
analyze
the
methods
by
which
the
staff
of
the
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
has
estimated
out-of-pocket
costs
and
apportioned
residue
costs
.

and
a
mere
cost
apportionment
which
somehow
spreads
among
the
classes
and
units
of
service
even
those
costs
that
are
strictly
unallocable
from
the
standpoint
of
specific
cost
determination
.

We
turn
now
to
a
type
of
fully
distributed
cost
analysis
which
,
unlike
the
railroad
type
,
draws
no
distinction
between
cost
allocation
and
cost
apportionment
:
the
single-step
type
.

Instead
,
all
of
the
total
costs
are
treated
as
variable
costs
,
although
these
costs
are
divided
into
costs
that
are
deemed
to
be
functions
of
different
variables
.

But
the
major
portions
of
the
total
costs
of
a
utility
business
are
common
or
joint
to
all
,
or
nearly
all
,
classes
of
customers
;
;

The
general
basis
on
which
these
common
costs
are
assigned
to
differently
measured
units
of
service
will
be
illustrated
by
the
following
highly
simplified
problem
of
an
electric-utility
cost
analysis
.

But
in
the
second
subtype
,
which
I
take
to
be
the
one
more
frequently
applied
,
only
the
operating
expenses
and
not
the
cost
of
capital
or
fair
return
are
apportioned
directly
among
the
various
classes
of
service
.

Other
services
will
show
different
rates
of
return
,
some
probably
much
lower
and
some
higher
.

Needless
to
say
,
any
such
inference
would
be
quite
unwarranted
.

Three-part
analysis
of
the
costs
of
an
electric
utility
business

In
order
to
simplify
the
exposition
of
a
typical
fully
apportioned
cost
analysis
,
let
us
assume
the
application
of
the
analysis
to
an
electric
utility
company
supplying
a
single
city
with
power
generated
by
its
own
steam-generation
plant
.

The
simplest
division
,
and
the
one
most
frequently
used
(
with
subdivisions
)
in
gas
and
electric
rate
cases
,
is
a
threefold
division
of
the
total
operating
and
capital
costs
into
customer
costs
,
energy
or
volumetric
costs
,
and
demand
or
capacity
costs
.

Let
us
therefore
consider
each
of
the
three
types
of
cost
in
turn
,
recognizing
that
this
simplified
classification
is
used
only
for
illustrative
purposes
;
;

For
if
the
small
group
notion
involves
the
implicit
claim
that
the
phenomena
of
sociological
investigations
are
of
atomic
or
subatomic
proportions
,
the
philosopher
needs
to
know
the
extent
to
which
such
entities
are
valid
.

shaping
the
contours
of
life
to
fit
the
needs
of
legends
.

(
cf.
Wetter
,
1952
:
:

What
is
left
to
traditional
systems
of
philosophy
is
,
in
effect
,
only
the
history
of
these
fields
prior
to
their
becoming
rigorous
enough
to
abide
by
the
canons
of
scientific
method
.

The
relinquishing
by
philosophy
of
pretentious
claims
to
empirical
priority
gives
it
an
ability
to
treat
problems
of
meaning
and
truth
which
in
the
past
it
was
unable
to
examine
because
of
its
missionary
attitude
to
knowledge
of
more
humble
sorts
.

In
this
connection
,
it
might
be
noted
that
the
theory
of
games
was
a
mathematical
discovery
long
before
its
uses
in
political
science
were
exploited
.

This
does
not
mean
that
philosophy
resolves
the
problems
it
generates
,
any
more
so
than
Riemann's
geometry
settled
the
physical
status
of
the
space-time
continuum
.

However
,
modesty
and
triviality
are
different
qualities
.

When
dealing
with
the
actual
relation
of
philosophy
to
the
sociology
of
knowledge
,
or
better
the
role
of
philosophy
in
assisting
research
on
the
social
sources
of
ideas
,
one
has
to
become
necessarily
selective
.

It
is
rather
that
introducing
them
into
social
analysis
reflects
not
so
much
a
search
for
truth
as
for
certainty
.

A
philosophy
which
attempts
to
supply
ultimate
answers
in
an
ultimate
way
reveals
its
acquiescence
in
the
shortcomings
of
men
,
an
impatience
with
partial
,
tentative
solutions
.

To
find
a
place
for
them
in
their
theory
of
knowledge
would
require
them
to
revise
the
theory
radically
,
and
yet
that
theory
was
what
they
regarded
as
their
most
important
discovery
.

It
has
been
said
of
John
Stuart
Mill
that
he
wrote
so
clearly
that
he
could
be
found
out
.

We
come
upon
a
rabbit
that
has
been
caught
in
one
of
the
brutal
traps
in
common
use
.

I
hold
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
we
mean
to
assert
something
of
the
pain
itself
,
namely
,
that
it
was
bad
--
bad
when
and
as
it
occurred
.

On
that
view
,
nothing
good
or
bad
happened
in
the
case
until
I
came
on
the
scene
and
made
my
remark
.

Are
we
prepared
to
say
that
in
that
case
nothing
bad
occurred
in
the
sense
in
which
we
said
it
did
?
?

Let
us
suppose
that
the
animal
did
not
in
fact
fall
into
the
trap
and
did
not
suffer
at
all
,
but
that
we
mistakenly
believe
it
did
,
and
say
as
before
that
its
suffering
was
an
evil
thing
.

So
far
as
I
can
see
,
there
is
only
one
way
out
for
the
positivist
.

In
these
circumstances
,
since
what
was
expressed
by
the
remark
when
first
made
is
,
on
the
theory
before
us
,
simply
absent
,
the
remark
now
expresses
nothing
.

We
should
say
that
we
made
our
point
with
feeling
the
first
time
and
little
or
no
feeling
the
second
time
,
but
that
it
was
the
same
point
we
were
making
.

I
have
heard
stories
,
he
writes
,
of
the
most
terrible
,
the
most
unnatural
actions
,
of
the
most
monstrous
murders
,
told
with
the
most
spontaneous
,
childishly
merry
laughter
.

and
even
on
subjectivist
assumptions
that
does
not
seem
very
bright
.

This
resulted
in
damage
to
the
occipital
lobe
and
very
probably
to
the
left
side
of
the
cerebellum
also
.

In
any
event
,
the
extraordinary
result
of
this
injury
was
that
he
became
psychically
blind
,
while
at
the
same
time
,
apparently
,
the
sense
of
touch
remained
essentially
intact
.

This
circumstance
in
the
patient's
case
plus
the
fact
that
his
tactual
capacity
remained
basically
in
sound
working
order
constitutes
its
exceptional
value
for
the
problem
at
hand
since
the
evidence
presented
by
the
authors
is
overwhelming
that
,
when
the
patient
closed
his
eyes
,
he
had
absolutely
no
spatial
(
that
is
,
third-dimensional
)
awareness
whatsoever
.

The
force
of
the
authors'
analysis
(
if
indeed
it
has
any
force
)
can
be
felt
by
the
reader
,
I
believe
,
only
after
three
questions
have
been
successfully
answered
.

(
1
)
What
allows
us
to
think
that
the
patient
had
no
third-dimensional
representations
when
his
eyes
were
closed
?
?

(
3
)
How
can
we
be
sure
that
his
sense
of
touch
was
not
profoundly
disturbed
by
his
head
injury
?
?

The
supposed
tactual
sense
of
spatial
location
and
orientation
in
the
patient
and
his
ability
to
specify
the
location
of
a
member
,
as
well
as
the
direction
and
scope
of
a
movement
,
passively
executed
(
with
one
of
his
members
)
,
proved
to
have
been
,
on
the
contrary
,
very
considerably
affected
.

and
he
could
tell
,
simply
by
the
feel
of
it
,
whether
it
was
made
of
wood
,
iron
,
cloth
,
rubber
,
and
so
on
.

that
is
,
he
was
unaware
what
kind
of
objects
they
were
or
what
their
use
was
.

Because
of
his
brain
injury
and
the
extreme
damage
suffered
to
his
sight
,
the
patient
had
to
train
himself
for
a
new
line
of
work
,
that
of
a
portfolio-maker
,
an
occupation
requiring
a
great
deal
of
precision
in
the
making
of
measurements
and
a
fairly
well-developed
sense
of
form
and
contour
.

And
so
the
authors
conclude
:
The
conduct
of
the
patient
in
his
every-day
life
and
in
his
work
,
even
more
than
the
foregoing
facts
(
mentioned
above
under
1
)
,
leave
positively
no
room
for
doubt
that
the
sense
of
touch
,
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
,
was
unaffected
;
;

or
,
to
put
the
same
thing
in
physiological
terms
,
that
the
performance-capacity
of
the
tactual
apparatus
,
from
the
periphery
up
to
the
tactual
centers
in
the
brain
,
--
that
is
,
from
one
end
to
the
other
--
was
unimpaired
.

But
before
we
can
do
this
,
we
must
first
find
answers
to
our
original
questions
1
and
2
;
;

could
piece
,
as
it
were
,
the
jumbled
mass
together
into
an
organized
whole
and
then
recognize
it
as
a
man
or
a
triangle
or
whatever
it
turned
out
to
be
.

This
meant
,
concretely
,
that
the
patient
could
not
read
at
all
without
making
writing-like
movements
of
the
head
or
body
,
became
easily
confused
by
hasher
marks
inserted
between
hand-written
words
and
thus
confused
the
mark
for
one
of
the
letters
,
and
could
recognize
a
simple
straight
line
or
a
curved
one
only
by
tracing
it
.

and
there
was
ample
evidence
of
the
following
sort
to
corroborate
him
.

As
one
would
surmise
,
the
procedure
,
however
,
could
be
repeated
with
the
same
object
or
with
the
same
type
of
object
often
enough
,
so
that
the
corresponding
visual
blots
and
the
merest
beginning
of
the
tracing
movement
would
provide
clues
as
to
the
actual
shape
,
which
the
patient
then
immediately
could
determine
by
a
kind
of
inference
.

Men
,
trees
,
automobiles
,
houses
,
and
so
on
--
objects
continually
confronted
in
everyday
life
--
had
each
its
characteristic
blot-appearance
and
became
easily
recognizable
,
at
the
very
beginning
of
tracing
,
by
an
inference
as
to
what
each
was
.

How
,
then
,
do
the
kinesthetic
sensations
function
in
all
this
?
?

was
an
area
of
common
tongue
and
of
common
culture
.

Greek
history
and
culture
were
enduringly
fertilized
,
and
plagued
,
by
the
interplay
of
these
conjoined
yet
opposed
factors
.

if
we
could
see
more
deeply
,
we
probably
would
find
many
side
issues
and
wrong
turnings
which
came
to
an
end
within
the
period
.

Chapter
5
the
early
eighth
century

the
landscape
of
Greek
history
broadens
widely
,
and
rather
abruptly
,
in
the
eighth
century
B.C.
,
the
age
of
Homer's
rosy-fingered
Dawn
.

Since
writing
was
practiced
in
the
Aegean
before
the
end
of
the
century
,
we
may
hope
that
the
details
of
tradition
will
now
be
occasionally
useful
.

but
both
were
among
the
last
products
of
a
phase
which
was
ending
.

trade
was
just
beginning
to
expand
;
;

The
potters
,
in
particular
,
had
virtually
eschewed
freehand
drawing
,
elaborate
motifs
,
and
the
curving
lines
of
nature
,
while
yet
expressing
a
belief
that
there
was
order
in
the
universe
.

By
800
social
and
cultural
security
had
been
achieved
,
at
least
on
a
simple
plane
;
;

Ripe
Geometric
potters
continued
to
employ
the
old
syntax
of
ornaments
and
shapes
and
made
use
of
the
well-defined
though
limited
range
of
motifs
which
they
had
inherited
.

To
the
ancestral
lore
,
however
,
new
materials
were
added
.

Wavy
lines
,
feather-like
patterns
,
rosettes
of
indefinitely
floral
nature
,
birds
either
singly
or
in
stylized
rows
,
animals
in
solemn
frieze
bands
(
see
Plates
11
-
12
)
--
all
these
turned
up
in
the
more
developed
fabrics
as
preliminary
signs
that
the
potters
were
broadening
their
gaze
.

Cook
had
discovered
a
beef
in
his
possession
a
few
days
earlier
and
,
when
he
could
not
show
the
hide
,
arrested
him
.

Arriving
at
daybreak
,
they
found
Julio
in
his
corral
and
demanded
that
he
surrender
.

On
February
17
,
Russell
and
Cook
were
sent
to
the
Pena
Flor
community
on
the
Vermejo
to
see
about
renting
out
ranches
the
company
had
purchased
.

Suspecting
an
ambush
,
the
two
deputies
decided
to
ride
up
a
side
canyon
taking
a
short
cut
into
Catskill
.

They
stayed
with
a
rancher
Friday
night
and
by
eleven
o'clock
Saturday
morning
passed
the
old
Garnett
Lee
ranch
.

With
the
first
reports
,
Russell's
horse
wheeled
to
the
right
and
ran
towards
the
buildings
while
Cook
,
followed
by
a
hail
of
bullets
,
raced
towards
the
arroyo
of
Salyer's
Canyon
immediately
in
front
of
him
,
just
reaching
it
as
his
horse
fell
.

Before
daylight
Sunday
morning
,
a
posse
of
twenty-three
men
under
the
leadership
of
Deputy
Sheriff
Frank
MacPherson
of
Catskill
followed
the
trail
to
the
house
of
Francisco
Chaves
,
where
100
to
150
Mexicans
had
gathered
.

The
posse's
retreat
encouraged
the
Mexicans
to
be
overbearing
and
impudent
.

and
a
store
was
broken
into
and
robbed
.

His
friends
advised
that
it
would
be
only
a
question
of
time
until
either
the
Mexicans
killed
him
by
ambuscade
or
he
would
be
compelled
to
kill
them
in
self-defense
,
perpetuating
the
troubles
.

By
early
summer
,
he
wrote
from
Laramie
that
he
was
suffering
from
the
wound
inflicted
in
the
ambush
and
was
in
a
bad
way
financially
,
so
Pels
sent
him
a
draft
for
$100
,
warning
that
it
was
still
not
wise
for
him
to
return
.

Pels
also
sent
a
check
for
$100
to
Russell's
widow
and
had
a
white
marble
monument
erected
on
his
grave
.

They
were
reluctant
to
appoint
sheriffs
to
protect
the
property
,
thus
running
the
risk
of
creating
disturbances
such
as
that
on
the
Vermejo
,
and
yet
the
cowboys
protested
that
they
got
no
salary
for
arresting
cattle
thieves
and
running
the
risk
of
being
shot
.

The
judge
became
ill
just
as
the
Colfax
District
Court
convened
,
no
substitute
was
brought
in
,
no
criminal
cases
heard
,
only
5
out
of
122
cases
docketed
were
tried
,
and
court
adjourned
sine
die
after
sitting
a
few
days
instead
of
the
usual
three
weeks
.

Although
wanted
by
the
sheriff
for
killing
an
old
man
named
Asher
Jones
,
the
warrant
for
his
arrest
had
never
been
served
.

Shot
near
the
heart
,
he
turned
to
one
side
and
plunged
for
a
door
to
another
room
several
feet
away
,
three
bullets
following
him
.

As
he
pushed
open
the
door
he
fell
on
his
face
,
one
of
his
comrades
pulling
him
inside
.

Finding
it
true
that
he
was
not
inside
,
the
deputies
returned
to
the
first
house
and
tore
holes
through
the
side
and
the
roof
until
they
could
see
a
body
on
the
bed
covered
by
a
blanket
.

Shot
six
or
eight
times
the
body
was
draped
with
Russell's
pistol
,
belt
,
and
cartridges
.

There
was
no
extra
horse
so
it
was
left
to
his
comrades
who
,
though
numbering
in
the
fifties
,
had
stood
around
on
the
hillside
nearby
without
firing
a
shot
during
the
entire
attack
.

Early
the
next
morning
,
a
Mexican
telephoned
Pels
that
Celso
Chavez
,
one
of
the
posse
members
,
was
surrounded
by
ten
Mexicans
at
his
father's
home
on
the
upper
Vermejo
.

Traveling
all
night
,
Clark
and
twelve
men
arrived
at
about
seven
o'clock
May
22
.

His
problem
then
became
one
of
restraining
the
American
fighters
who
wanted
to
clean
out
the
Vermejo
by
force
immediately
.

Fire
District
No.

discussed
its
possible
purchase
in
1945
,
but
considered
it
an
unwise
investment
.

B.
J.
Connell
is
the
present
treasurer
and
manager
.

Orvis
even
needed
to
hire
an
assistant
,
Clark
J.
Wait
.

In
the
fall
of
1878
,
the
Popular
Telegraph
Line
was
established
between
Manchester
and
Factory
Point
by
the
owners
,
Paul
W.
Orvis
,
Henry
Gray
,
J.
N.
Hard
,
and
Clark
J.
Wait
.

The
line
soon
lived
up
to
its
name
,
as
local
messages
of
moderate
length
could
be
sent
for
a
dime
and
the
company
was
quickly
able
to
declare
very
liberal
dividends
on
its
capital
stock
.

Telegraphers
at
the
Depot
at
this
time
were
Aaron
C.
Burr
and
Mark
Manley
of
Burr
and
Manley
,
dealers
in
lumber
and
dry
goods
.

H.
K.
Fowler
,
vice-president
and
secretary
;
;

H.
S.
Walker
,
assistant
superintendent
.

Two
companies
now
had
headquarters
with
Clark
J.
Wait
,
who
by
then
had
his
own
drugstore
at
Factory
Point
--
the
Northern
Union
Telegraph
Company
and
the
Western
Union
.

Still
existing
on
a
Northern
Union
telegraph
form
is
a
typical
peremptory
message
from
Peru
grocer
J.
J.
Hapgood
to
Burton
and
Graves'
store
in
Manchester
--
Get
and
send
by
stage
four
pounds
best
Porterhouse
or
serloin
stake
,
for
Mrs.
Hapgood
send
six
sweet
oranges
.

During
the
summers
,
Towsley
often
needed
the
assistance
of
a
company
operator
.

In
his
wake
came
the
District
Traffic
Supervisor
and
the
cream
of
the
telegraphic
profession
,
ten
of
Boston's
best
,
chosen
for
their
long
experience
and
thorough
knowledge
of
golf
.

This
was
extended
the
following
year
to
include
the
railroad
station
agent's
office
and
Thayer's
Hotel
at
Factory
Point
.

In
November
1887
a
line
connecting
several
dwelling
houses
in
Dorset
was
extended
to
Manchester
Depot
.

Telephone
wires
from
Louis
Dufresne's
house
in
East
Manchester
to
the
Dufresne
lumber
job
near
Bourn
Pond
were
up
about
1895
.

Service
running
through
Barnumville
and
to
Bennington
County
towns
east
of
the
mountains
was
in
the
hands
of
the
Gleason
Telephone
Company
in
1925
,
but
major
supervision
of
telephone
lines
in
Manchester
was
with
the
New
England
Telephone
and
Telegraph
Company
,
which
eventually
gained
all
control
.

This
eliminated
toll
calls
between
the
two
towns
.

No
records
are
available
as
to
the
date
or
extent
of
installation
,
but
it
may
have
been
in
1896
.

and
William
F.
Orvis
,
secretary
.

This
was
fortunate
,
as
the
Vail
plant
burned
in
1905
.

The
latter
now
furnishes
the
area
with
electricity
distributed
from
a
modern
sub-station
at
Manchester
Depot
which
was
put
into
operation
February
19
,
1930
and
was
improved
in
January
1942
by
the
installation
of
larger
transformers
.

More
stands
on
the
margins
of
modernity
for
one
reason
alone
--
because
he
wrote
Utopia
.

Can
we
discover
what
it
is
in
Utopia
that
has
evoked
this
response
?
?

To
others
whose
concern
it
is
to
penetrate
the
significance
of
Christian
Humanism
,
the
Renaissance
elements
are
of
primary
concern
.

But
here
we
have
a
distinctly
modern
preoccupation
;
;

we
want
to
know
why
that
book
has
kept
on
selling
the
way
it
has
;
;

we
want
to
know
what
is
perennially
new
about
Utopia
.

To
that
question
the
answer
is
simple
;
;

We
find
it
in
Plato's
Republic
,
and
in
Utopia
More
acknowledges
his
debt
to
that
book
.

We
find
it
in
that
common
way
of
life
pleasing
to
Christ
and
still
in
use
among
the
truest
societies
of
Christians
,
that
is
,
the
better
monasteries
which
made
it
easier
to
convert
the
Utopians
to
Christianity
.

Perhaps
one
way
to
sharpen
our
sense
of
the
modernity
of
Utopian
communism
is
to
contrast
it
with
the
principal
earlier
types
of
communistic
theory
.

and
it
is
to
this
problem
that
the
Republic
ultimately
returns
.

And
the
monastic
communities
were
supposed
to
be
made
up
of
volunteers
selected
only
after
a
novitiate
which
would
test
their
religious
aptitude
for
monastic
rigors
,
their
spiritual
athleticism
.

The
actual
function
of
patristic
communism
was
adequately
set
forth
by
St.
Gregory
almost
a
millenium
before
More
wrote
Utopia
.

In
a
like
sense
whatever
bits
or
shreds
of
previous
conceptions
one
may
find
in
it
,
Utopian
communism
remains
,
as
an
integral
whole
,
original
--
a
new
thing
.

it
is
one
of
the
very
few
new
things
in
Utopia
;
;

most
of
the
rest
is
medieval
or
humanist
or
part
of
an
old
tradition
of
social
criticism
.

Although
Utopian
communism
is
both
new
in
1516
and
also
modern
,
it
is
not
modern
communism
or
even
modern
socialism
,
as
they
exist
or
have
ever
existed
in
theory
or
in
practice
.

even
houses
changed
once
a
decade
;
;

The
Providence
Daily
Journal
stated
that
although
the
guilt
of
Brown
was
evident
,
the
South
must
guarantee
him
a
fair
trial
to
preserve
domestic
peace
.

Upon
receiving
the
news
,
Northern
writers
,
editors
,
and
clergymen
heaped
accusations
of
murder
on
the
Southern
states
,
particularly
Virginia
.

On
Wednesday
morning
,
November
2
,
1859
,
the
Providence
Daily
Journal
stated
that
although
Brown
justly
deserved
the
extreme
penalty
,
no
man
,
however
criminal
,
ought
to
suffer
the
penalty
without
a
fair
trial
.

There
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
control
the
Republican
party
exercised
throughout
the
state
.

Elisha
R.
Potter
was
the
Democratic
candidate
.

The
Providence
Daily
Journal
,
however
,
stated
that
Brown's
courage
,
bravery
,
and
heroism
in
a
good
cause
would
make
a
man
a
martyr
;
;

The
only
public
demonstration
in
honor
of
John
Brown
was
held
at
Pratt's
Hall
in
Providence
,
on
the
day
of
his
execution
.

The
next
speaker
was
George
T.
Day
.

In
the
remainder
of
his
speech
Davis
spoke
of
his
admiration
for
Brown
and
warned
those
who
took
part
in
the
meeting
that
they
are
liable
to
the
charge
that
they
are
supporting
traitors
and
upholding
men
whom
the
laws
have
condemned
.

Resolved
that
the
anti-slavery
sentiment
is
becoming
ripe
for
resolute
action
.

When
we
examine
what
each
master
says
was
his
first
collage
we
see
that
much
the
same
thing
happens
in
each
.

Literal
flatness
now
tends
to
assert
itself
as
the
main
event
of
the
picture
,
and
the
device
boomerangs
:
the
illusion
of
depth
is
rendered
even
more
precarious
than
before
.

In
their
very
first
collages
,
Braque
and
Picasso
draw
or
paint
over
and
on
the
affixed
paper
or
cloth
,
so
that
certain
of
the
principal
features
of
their
subjects
as
depicted
seem
to
thrust
out
into
real
,
bas-relief
space
--
or
to
be
about
to
do
so
--
while
the
rest
of
the
subject
remains
imbedded
in
,
or
flat
upon
,
the
surface
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
wallpaper
strips
themselves
seem
to
be
pushed
into
depth
by
the
lines
and
patches
of
shading
charcoaled
upon
them
,
and
by
their
placing
in
relation
to
the
block
capitals
;
;

Thus
every
part
and
plane
of
the
picture
keeps
changing
place
in
relative
depth
with
every
other
part
and
plane
;
;

and
it
is
as
if
the
only
stable
relation
left
among
the
different
parts
of
the
picture
is
the
ambivalent
and
ambiguous
one
that
each
has
with
the
surface
.

In
later
collages
of
both
masters
,
a
variety
of
extraneous
materials
are
used
,
sometimes
in
the
same
work
,
and
almost
always
in
conjunction
with
every
other
eye-deceiving
and
eye-undeceiving
device
they
can
think
of
.

Depicted
,
Cubist
flatness
is
now
almost
completely
assimilated
to
the
literal
,
undepicted
kind
,
but
at
the
same
time
it
reacts
upon
and
largely
transforms
the
undepicted
kind
--
and
it
does
so
,
moreover
,
without
depriving
the
latter
of
its
literalness
;
;

For
it
had
turned
out
,
by
a
further
paradox
of
Cubism
,
that
the
means
to
an
illusion
of
depth
and
plasticity
had
now
become
widely
divergent
from
the
means
of
representation
or
imaging
.

In
order
to
be
saved
,
plasticity
had
had
to
be
isolated
;
;

It
was
then
that
Picasso
and
Braque
were
confronted
with
a
unique
dilemma
:
they
had
to
choose
between
illusion
and
representation
.

It
was
as
though
,
in
that
instant
,
he
had
felt
the
flatness
of
collage
as
too
constricting
and
had
suddenly
tried
to
escape
all
the
way
back
--
or
forward
--
to
literal
three-dimensionality
.

The
affixed
elements
of
collage
were
extruded
,
as
it
were
,
and
cut
off
from
the
literal
pictorial
surface
to
form
a
bas-relief
.

)
And
without
high
density
in
the
core
,
rapid-transit
systems
cannot
be
maintained
economically
,
let
alone
built
from
scratch
at
today's
prices
.

it
removes
forever
from
the
tax
rolls
property
which
should
be
taxed
to
pay
for
the
city
services
.

Subways
improved
land
values
without
taking
away
land
;
;

City
planners
do
not
always
use
this
boundary
as
effectively
as
they
might
.

Less
ambitious
freeway
plans
may
be
more
successful
--
especially
when
the
roadways
and
interchanges
are
raised
,
allowing
for
cross
access
at
many
points
and
providing
parking
areas
below
the
ramp
.

The
appeal
of
the
suburb
is
particularly
strong
for
heavy
industry
,
which
must
move
bulky
objects
along
a
lengthy
assembly
line
and
wants
enough
land
area
to
do
the
entire
job
on
one
floor
.

To
light
industry
,
the
economies
of
being
on
one
floor
are
much
slighter
,
but
efficiency
engineers
usually
believe
in
them
,
and
manufacturers
looking
for
ways
to
cut
costs
cannot
be
prevented
from
turning
to
efficiency
engineers
.

The
truck
and
the
car
gave
the
manufacturer
a
new
degree
of
freedom
in
selecting
his
plant
site
.

They
are
all
suburban
plants
,
relying
on
the
roads
to
keep
them
supplied
with
workers
.

And
wherever
the
new
thruways
go
up
their
banks
are
lined
by
neat
glass
and
metal
and
colored
brick
light
industry
.

They
can
even
be
rather
grand
,
like
Edward
Land's
monument
to
the
astonishing
success
of
Polaroid
.

It
is
interesting
to
note
how
many
of
the
plants
on
Massachusetts'
Route
128
draw
most
of
their
income
either
from
the
government
in
non-competitive
cost-plus
arrangements
,
or
from
the
exploitation
of
patents
which
grant
at
least
a
partial
monopoly
.

These
stores
are
still
there
,
but
the
volume
of
the
downtown
store
has
been
on
a
relative
decline
,
while
in
many
cities
the
suburban
branch
sells
more
and
more
dry
goods
.

If
the
retailer
and
hotelman's
downtown
unit
sales
have
been
decreasing
,
however
,
his
dollar
volume
continues
to
rise
,
and
it
is
dollars
which
you
put
in
the
bank
.

In
many
cases
that
statement
--
We
break
even
on
our
downtown
operation
and
make
money
on
our
branches
--
would
be
turned
around
if
the
cost
analysis
were
recalculated
on
terms
less
prejudicial
to
the
old
store
.

Fear
of
the
competition
--
always
a
great
motivating
force
in
the
American
economy
--
makes
retailers
who
do
not
have
suburban
operations
exaggerate
both
the
volume
and
the
profitability
of
their
rival's
shiny
new
branches
.

To
the
extent
that
the
problem
is
merely
parking
,
an
aggressive
downtown
management
,
like
that
of
Lazarus
Brothers
in
Columbus
,
Ohio
,
can
fight
back
successfully
by
building
a
garage
on
the
lot
next
door
.

The
downtown
store
continues
to
offer
the
great
inducement
of
variety
,
both
within
its
gates
and
across
the
street
,
where
other
department
stores
are
immediately
convenient
for
the
shopper
who
wants
to
see
what
is
available
before
making
up
her
mind
.

If
this
analysis
is
correct
,
the
suburban
branches
will
turn
out
to
be
what
management's
cost
accountants
refuse
to
acknowledge
,
marginal
operations
rather
than
major
factors
.

Was
a
question
that
had
to
be
asked
long
before
they
saw
Paree
.

At
the
same
time
,
Roosevelt's
Federal
Housing
Administration
,
coupled
with
Henry
Morgenthau's
cheap-money
policy
,
permitted
ordinary
lower-middle-class
families
to
build
their
own
homes
.

householders
who
had
been
unable
to
pick
up
the
burden
of
short-term
high-interest
mortgages
found
they
could
borrow
for
twenty-five
years
at
4
per
cent
,
under
government
aegis
.

The
descent
may
be
remote
,
but
this
is
surely
the
only
full-scale
example
of
that
vigorous
inheritance
in
the
United
States
.

After
many
years
and
many
interruptions
he
was
able
to
finish
the
canopy
fresco
,
and
slightly
less
than
half
the
frieze
,
beginning
with
the
Liberty
group
opposite
the
East
door
,
and
ending
with
William
Penn
,
all
but
one
leg
,
when
a
tragic
accident
ended
his
career
.

He
left
at
his
death
sketches
,
drawn
to
scale
,
for
the
rest
of
the
circle
.

A
blank
undecorated
void
,
plastered
in
roughcast
,
disfigured
the
wall
of
the
Rotunda
until
1951
.

These
may
be
consulted
in
the
office
of
the
Architect
of
the
Capitol
,
or
the
Library
of
Congress
.

The
scaffold
was
the
length
of
the
space
to
be
painted
.

Washed
,
they
came
out
surprisingly
clear
and
bright
.

A
brown
hatching
reinforces
and
broadens
shadows
,
and
much
of
the
background
is
solidly
covered
with
a
dark
coat
.

In
our
own
practice
,
to
have
the
last
intonaco
plaster
coat
thick
enough
to
match
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
fine
cracks
in
drying
,
we
found
that
it
had
to
be
put
on
in
two
layers
,
letting
the
first
set
awhile
before
applying
the
second
.

In
older
Italian
practice
,
lime
,
dried
and
reground
bianco
sangiovanni
,
entered
into
such
prepared
shades
.

Later
Brumidi
and
Costaggini
will
be
seen
coping
with
this
same
problem
.

where
,
of
Costaggini
,
only
some
foliage
has
been
washed
,
at
the
point
where
his
work
stopped
.

Costaggini
said
it
was
Brumidi's
fault
in
not
providing
enough
material
to
fill
the
circle
.

Brumidi's
son
later
maintained
that
Costaggini
had
compressed
and
mutilated
his
father's
designs
,
ambitiously
coveting
a
bit
he
could
claim
for
his
very
own
.

This
question
might
be
settled
by
comparing
the
measurement
of
the
actual
circumference
with
the
dimensions
noted
,
presumably
in
Brumidi's
hand
,
above
the
various
sections
of
his
long
preparatory
drawing
,
which
has
been
kept
.

In
painting
a
fresco
,
the
handling
of
wet
mortar
compels
one
always
to
move
from
top
to
bottom
and
from
left
to
right
,
not
to
spoil
yesterday's
work
with
today's
plastering
.

At
the
very
first
,
then
,
Brumidi
was
required
,
by
the
classically
pyramidal
shape
of
his
central
group
,
to
fill
in
the
triangular
space
above
the
seated
girl
on
Liberty's
right
,
before
starting
on
the
allegorical
figures
themselves
.

Here
he
put
a
small
man
,
whose
missing
hands
might
have
left
his
function
doubtful
,
until
comparison
with
the
first
sketches
showed
that
when
the
artist
came
back
to
the
beginning
,
this
was
to
be
the
closing
figure
of
the
party
of
forty-niners
,
and
was
to
hold
a
basket
.

The
photograph
,
Figure
1
of
the
completed
frieze
,
shows
how
,
having
been
separated
from
his
fellows
in
useless
isolation
for
eighty
years
,
he
has
now
been
given
a
hand
,
and
by
juxtaposition
(
and
the
permission
of
the
Committee
)
,
given
a
new
job
,
to
represent
the
witnesses
of
the
first
flight
at
Kitty
Hawk
in
1903
.

No
soap
or
other
cleaning
agent
was
used
that
might
bring
in
unwanted
chemical
reactions
.

a
little
of
the
secco
came
off
.

Necessary
retouching
was
put
on
at
once
.

Apparently
not
more
than
dusting
had
ever
been
done
,
and
not
much
of
that
.

The
greatest
source
of
trouble
was
rain
which
had
repeatedly
flowed
from
openings
above
,
soaking
the
surface
and
leaving
streaks
of
dissolved
lime
,
very
conspicuous
even
after
cleaning
,
particularly
in
the
Landing
of
Columbus
,
Oglethorpe
and
the
Indians
,
and
Yorktown
.

With
naked
gas
jets
below
and
leaky
windows
above
,
enough
to
ruin
wall
paintings
in
any
medium
,
they
have
survived
,
in
a
building
long
unheated
in
winter
,
hot
and
damp
under
the
iron
dome
in
summer
.

This
letter
might
not
have
been
necessary
had
our
efforts
to
meet
and
talk
with
you
been
more
successful
.

Even
though
we
did
not
see
many
of
your
faces
,
it
appears
now
quite
evident
that
a
considerable
number
of
your
profession
heard
,
from
those
whom
we
had
the
fortune
to
encounter
,
that
we
had
been
in
your
midst
.

It
is
my
hope
that
this
written
message
and
report
will
reach
you
through
the
good
offices
of
the
Union
of
Soviet
Artists
.

If
this
attitude
is
seriously
questioned
in
the
Soviet
Union
,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
majority
of
the
society
in
which
I
live
is
too
aware
of
the
necessity
for
clarity
on
this
ethical
as
well
as
aesthetic
point
of
view
.

Almost
as
if
I
were
talking
about
something
quite
unreal
.

Personal
predispositions
tend
to
blunt
the
ear
and
,
in
turn
,
the
voice
as
well
.

the
aggressive
disbelief
of
those
who
are
romantically
lost
in
a
semantic
jungle
of
the
word
Revolution
;
;

Difficult
as
it
may
have
been
at
times
,
Pozzatti
and
I
saw
enough
,
talked
to
enough
artists
,
historians
and
others
to
realize
that
the
issue
is
quite
clear
.

It
cannot
be
said
that
our
very
first
day
in
the
Soviet
Union
turned
out
to
be
an
ordinary
one
.

The
grave
,
about
half-way
between
his
home
and
the
blue
turrets
of
a
small
church
,
rose
above
the
forms
and
spaces
of
gently
undisciplined
pastures
of
green
,
the
sounds
of
birds
,
the
silence
of
other
graves
and
the
casual
paths
through
small
forests
.

But
today
we
were
aware
of
only
two
men
.

A
struggle
that
is
being
waged
all
over
the
world
in
the
half-light
of
disinterest
.

This
kind
of
reasoning
and
logic
takes
a
little
time
to
get
used
to
.

Theories
of
the
behavior
pattern
of
population
masses
were
compared
to
scientific
discoveries
concerning
the
motion-pattern
of
gaseous
masses
.

The
terms
of
friendship
,
understanding
,
cooperation
,
etc.
,
tend
to
become
somewhat
shopworn
because
of
constant
and
indiscriminate
use
.

This
gave
her
an
opportunity
to
ring
down
the
curtain
with
the
petulant
admonition
that
we
should
not
presume
to
lecture
her
on
Abstraction
.

She
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
,
as
was
done
on
other
occasions
,
that
Abstraction
as
well
as
Impressionism
were
a
Russian
invention
that
had
been
discarded
as
unwanted
by
the
people
of
the
U.S.S.R.

Pozzatti
and
I
could
not
know
then
that
we
would
experience
this
sort
of
treatment
more
often
in
Moscow
than
elsewhere
.

We
were
to
discover
,
in
fact
,
that
quite
a
number
of
people
share
with
us
the
impression
that
,
in
contrast
to
other
Soviet
regions
,
Moscow's
atmosphere
is
depressingly
subdued
and
official
.

The
following
is
a
statement
read
to
a
large
and
friendly
group
of
your
fellow
artists
in
Leningrad
:

Your
past
history
is
resplendent
with
the
fruits
of
the
intellect
.

Its
scope
is
as
broad
as
the
question
:
What
does
it
mean
to
live
in
modern
society
?
?

A
work
so
broad
,
even
when
it
is
directed
by
a
leading
idea
and
informed
by
a
moral
vision
,
must
necessarily
fail
.

It
is
a
simple
matter
,
for
one
so
disposed
,
to
take
a
work
like
The
Sane
Society
and
shred
it
into
odds
and
ends
.

I
mention
these
features
of
the
book
because
they
are
inherent
in
the
book's
character
and
therefore
must
be
mentioned
.

It
would
be
superfluous
to
build
a
critique
around
them
.

It
is
worthwhile
to
recall
that
Fromm's
treatment
has
both
descriptive
and
normative
aspects
.

Taking
alienation
as
a
dependent
variable
,
with
what
socio-structural
factors
is
it
most
highly
associated
?
?

Until
such
work
is
done
,
there
must
remain
the
nagging
suspicion
that
alienation
may
be
little
more
than
an
expression
of
the
malaise
of
the
intellectual
,
who
,
rejected
by
and
in
turn
rejecting
the
larger
society
,
projects
his
own
fear
and
despair
onto
the
broader
social
screen
.

Or
,
he
might
remind
Fromm
that
the
41
per
cent
figure
is
really
astonishingly
low
:
after
all
,
the
medieval
guild
system
was
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
100
per
cent
of
the
workers
ought
to
turn
out
only
the
average
amount
;
;

(
He
,
in
effect
,
does
say
this
in
his
discussion
of
the
pseudo-happiness
of
the
automaton
conformist
.

If
one
characteristic
distinguishes
Boris
Godunov
,
it
is
the
consistency
with
which
every
person
on
the
stage
--
including
the
chorus
--
comes
alive
in
the
music
.

Otherwise
Mussorgsky
reserves
his
vocal
melodies
for
prolonged
expressions
of
emotion
--
Boris'
first
monologue
,
for
example
.

Consider
the
four
monks
who
figure
prominently
in
the
action
:
Pimen
,
Varlaam
,
Missail
and
the
Jesuit
Rangoni
.

As
the
child
addresses
the
shepherd
in
a
dream
,
light
--
in
the
form
of
the
major
mode
--
begins
to
appear
,
and
at
the
moment
of
the
miracle
we
hear
a
clear
and
shining
D
major
.

Missail
is
the
straight
man
,
not
very
talkative
,
mild-mannered
when
he
does
speak
.

A
rough
ostinato
figure
,
heard
first
in
the
introduction
to
the
inn
scene
,
characterizes
him
amusingly
and
reappears
whenever
he
comes
into
the
action
:

The
Song
Of
Kazan
,
in
which
this
figure
becomes
a
wild-sounding
accompaniment
,
fills
in
the
picture
of
undisciplined
high
spirits
.

(
We
can
imagine
how
they
startled
audiences
of
the
1870's
.

As
the
knack
gradually
comes
back
to
him
,
his
rhythm
becomes
steadier
,
with
the
rigid
monotony
of
an
unskilled
reader
.

Curiously
,
this
scene
is
a
close
parallel
to
one
that
Verdi
was
writing
at
the
same
time
,
the
scene
between
Amonasro
and
Aida
.

This
is
no
assignment
for
a
frivolous
girl
,
she
assures
him
.

At
once
the
Jesuit
pulls
out
all
the
stops
.

the
conflict
is
not
Boris
versus
Grigori
or
Shuiski
or
even
the
ghost
of
the
murdered
child
,
but
Boris
versus
the
Russian
people
.

They
echo
the
words
with
which
he
has
described
his
own
vision
of
the
dying
child
who
trembles
and
begs
for
mercy
--
and
there
is
no
mercy
.

Though
brief
,
it
has
a
sharp
dramatic
edge
and
great
poignancy
.

)
There
is
still
more
news
,
Mityukh
announces
:
they
have
prayed
for
the
soul
of
the
Tsarevich
.

In
a
time
when
poetic
style
,
and
poetic
belief
as
well
,
seem
in
a
state
of
continual
flux
,
Hardy
stands
out
as
a
poet
of
almost
perverse
consistency
.

In
the
later
poems
,
however
,
the
personal
tone
predominates
.

These
dates
are
virtually
the
only
clues
we
have
to
the
chronology
of
the
poems
,
since
the
separate
volumes
are
neither
chronological
within
themselves
nor
in
relation
to
each
other
.

the
internal
organization
rarely
has
any
chronological
order
,
except
in
obvious
groups
like
the
Poems
of
Pilgrimage
,
the
Poems
of
1912
-
13
,
and
the
war
poems
.

There
was
one
sterile
period
:
only
one
poem
is
dated
between
1872
and
1882
and
,
except
for
the
poems
written
on
the
trip
to
Italy
in
1887
,
very
few
from
1882
to
1890
.

gave
up
verse
for
prose
,
1868
-
70
;
;

The
range
of
the
later
poetry
is
considerably
narrower
,
but
the
number
of
successful
poems
is
far
greater
.

Almost
anyone
could
have
written
it
;
;

The
language
is
the
conventional
language
of
the
form
;
;

There
are
many
such
competently
anonymous
performances
among
the
earlier
poems
.

These
are
the
poems
Hardy
wrote
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
;
;

they
compose
a
painful
elegy
to
what
might
have
been
,
to
a
marriage
that
began
with
a
promise
of
happiness
,
and
ended
in
long
years
of
suffering
and
hatred
.

The
view
is
always
toward
the
past
;
;

The
last
time
I
saw
Bird
,
at
Jimbo's
Bob
City
,
he
was
so
gone
--
so
blind
to
the
world
--
that
he
literally
sat
down
on
me
before
he
realized
I
was
there
.

I
said
,
referring
to
the
pretentious
Jazz
Concert
.

It
had
assumed
the
terrifying
inertia
of
inanimate
matter
.

The
difference
is
that
Horace
accepted
his
theme
with
a
kind
of
silken
assurance
.

He
was
able
to
find
meaning
in
his
art
as
long
as
it
was
the
answer
to
air
raids
and
gas
ovens
.

As
the
world
began
to
take
on
the
guise
of
an
immense
air
raid
or
gas
oven
,
I
believe
his
art
became
meaningless
to
him
.

Similarly
,
the
innovations
of
bop
,
and
of
Parker
particularly
,
have
been
vastly
overrated
by
people
unfamiliar
with
music
,
especially
by
that
ignoramus
,
the
intellectual
jitterbug
,
the
jazz
aficionado
.

This
is
true
of
the
melodic
line
which
could
be
put
together
from
selected
passages
of
almost
anybody
--
Benny
Carter
,
Johnny
Hodges
.

It
is
the
difference
between
Bach
and
Mozart
.

The
metaphysical
conceits
,
which
fascinate
the
Reactionary
Generation
still
dominant
in
backwater
American
colleges
,
were
embroideries
.

Again
,
contrary
to
popular
belief
,
there
is
nothing
crazy
or
frantic
about
Parker
either
musically
or
emotionally
.

In
fact
,
the
whole
generation
of
the
founding
fathers
of
bop
--
Gillespie
,
Monk
,
Davis
,
Blakey
,
and
the
rest
--
are
just
now
at
a
considerable
discount
.

Nothing
looks
anything
like
an
Ernst
or
an
Arp
but
another
Ernst
or
Arp
.

The
aesthetic
appeal
of
pure
paint
laid
on
at
random
may
exist
,
but
it
is
a
very
impoverished
appeal
.

A
process
of
elimination
which
leaves
the
artist
with
nothing
but
the
play
of
his
materials
themselves
cannot
sustain
interest
in
either
artist
or
public
for
very
long
.

Hrothgar's
court
bard
sings
of
the
encounters
at
Finnsburg
(
lines
1068
-
1159
)
,
and
improvises
the
tale
of
Beowulf's
exploits
in
a
complimentary
comparison
of
the
Geatish
visitor
with
Sigemund
(
lines
871
-
892
)
;
;

Nothing
in
all
this
is
autobiographical
:
unlike
the
poets
of
Deor
and
Widsith
,
the
poet
of
Beowulf
is
not
concerned
with
his
own
identity
;
;

Assonance
seems
nearly
as
severe
a
curb
,
although
in
a
celebrated
passage
William
of
Malmesbury
declares
that
A
Song
Of
Roland
was
intoned
before
the
battle
commenced
at
Hastings
.

The
poet
in
a
written
tradition
who
generally
never
blots
a
line
may
once
in
a
while
pause
and
polish
without
incurring
blame
.

Either
poet
could
quickly
and
easily
select
words
or
phrases
to
supply
his
immediate
requirements
as
he
chanted
out
his
lines
,
because
the
kennings
and
the
epithets
made
possible
the
construction
of
systems
of
numerous
synonyms
for
the
chief
common
and
proper
nouns
.

Combellack
argues
further
,
and
here
he
makes
his
main
point
,
that
once
The
Iliad
and
The
Odyssey
are
thought
formulaic
poems
composed
for
an
audience
accustomed
to
formulaic
poetry
,
Homeric
critics
are
deprived
of
an
entire
domain
they
previously
found
arable
.

Words
or
phrases
that
connoisseurs
have
admired
as
handsome
or
ironic
or
humorous
must
therefore
lose
merit
and
become
regarded
as
mere
inevitable
time-servers
,
sometimes
accurate
and
sometimes
not
.

Time-servers
,
though
the
periphrastic
expressions
are
,
they
may
nevertheless
be
handsome
or
ironic
or
humorous
.

Reliance
is
therefore
not
to
be
placed
upon
the
archaeological
particulars
in
an
oral
poem
;
;

In
Coriolanus
the
agnomen
of
Marcius
is
used
deliberately
and
pointedly
,
but
the
Homeric
epithets
and
the
Anglo-Saxon
kennings
are
used
casually
and
recall
to
the
hearer
a
familiar
story
or
situation
or
a
useful
or
pleasant
quality
of
the
referent
.

Thus
one
line
in
five
from
The
Iliad
and
The
Odyssey
is
to
be
found
somewhere
else
in
the
two
poems
.

The
closest
scrutiny
is
owed
to
the
Anglo-Saxon
kennings
and
the
Homeric
epithets
;
;

In
his
analysis
,
however
,
he
touches
upon
but
fails
to
explore
an
idea
,
generally
neglected
in
discussions
of
the
book
,
which
I
believe
is
central
to
its
art
--
the
importance
of
human
hands
as
a
recurring
feature
of
the
narrative
.

In
Great
Expectations
the
hands
become
almost
an
obsession
.

Miss
Havisham's
withered
hands
,
heavy
as
if
her
unhappiness
were
somehow
concentrated
in
them
,
move
in
restless
self-pity
between
her
broken
heart
and
her
walking
stick
.

Wemmick
reveals
his
self-satisfaction
by
regularly
rubbing
his
hands
together
.

Old
Mr.
Pocket's
frantic
response
to
life
imprisonment
with
a
useless
,
social-climbing
wife
is
to
put
his
two
hands
into
his
disturbed
hair
and
make
an
extraordinary
effort
to
lift
himself
up
by
it
,
whereas
Joe
Gargery
endures
the
shrewish
onslaughts
of
Mrs.
Joe
by
apologetically
drawing
the
back
of
his
hand
across
and
across
his
nose
.

Such
mannerisms
would
be
less
worthy
of
remark
,
were
it
not
that
in
Great
Expectations
,
as
in
no
other
of
Dickens'
novels
,
hands
serve
as
a
leitmotif
of
plot
and
theme
--
a
kind
of
unifying
symbol
or
natural
metaphor
for
the
book's
complex
of
human
interrelationships
and
the
values
and
attitudes
that
motivate
them
.

So
it
is
with
Great
Expectations
,
whether
the
hands
be
Orlick's
as
he
strikes
down
Mrs.
Gargery
or
Pip's
as
he
steals
a
pie
from
her
pantry
.

Through
such
details
Dickens
indicates
at
the
outset
that
guilt
is
a
part
of
the
ironic
bond
between
Pip
and
Magwitch
which
is
so
unpredictably
to
alter
both
their
lives
.

Dickens
,
for
excellent
psychological
reasons
,
never
fully
reveals
Magwitch's
felonious
past
,
but
Pip
,
at
the
convict's
climactic
reappearance
in
London
,
shrinks
from
clasping
a
hand
which
he
fears
might
be
stained
with
blood
.

Orlick
might
almost
be
Magwitch's
bogy
man
come
alive
,
a
figure
of
nemesis
from
Pip's
phantasy
of
guilt
.

The
scarred
,
disfigured
wrists
of
Mr.
Jaggers'
housekeeper
are
the
tell-tale
marks
of
her
sinister
past
,
for
her
master
,
coolly
exhibiting
them
to
his
dinner
guests
,
makes
a
point
of
the
force
of
grip
there
is
in
these
hands
.

Finally
,
Magwitch's
pursuit
of
Compeyson
,
his
archenemy
and
betrayer
,
begins
by
his
holding
him
in
a
vicelike
grip
on
the
river
flats
to
frustrate
his
escape
and
culminates
in
his
laying
his
hand
on
his
cloak
to
identify
him
,
thus
precipitating
the
death-locked
struggle
in
the
water
during
which
Compeyson
drowns
.

Almost
the
first
step
in
the
corruption
of
Pip's
values
is
the
unworthy
shame
he
feels
when
Estella
cruelly
remarks
the
coarseness
of
his
hands
:
They
had
never
troubled
me
before
,
but
they
troubled
me
now
,
as
vulgar
appendages
.

In
both
cases
the
finger-post
represents
Pip's
heightened
awareness
of
contrary
magnetisms
.

Pumblechook's
hands
throughout
the
novel
serve
to
travesty
greed
and
hypocritical
self-aggrandizement
.

We
take
leave
of
Pumblechook
as
he
gloats
over
Pip's
loss
of
fortune
,
extending
his
hand
with
a
magnificently
forgiving
air
and
exhibiting
the
same
fat
five
fingers
,
one
of
which
he
identifies
with
the
finger
of
Providence
and
shakes
at
Pip
in
a
canting
imputation
of
the
latter's
ingratitoode
and
his
own
generosity
as
Pip's
earliest
benefactor
.

Pip
first
learns
the
stupendous
power
of
money
from
the
sycophantic
tailor
,
Mr.
Trabb
,
whose
brutality
to
his
boy
helper
exactly
matches
the
financial
resource
of
each
new
customer
,
and
whose
fawning
hands
touch
the
outside
of
each
elbow
and
rub
Pip
out
of
the
shop
.

The
respectability
which
money
confers
implies
a
different
etiquette
,
and
,
upon
taking
up
the
life
of
a
London
gentleman
,
Pip
must
learn
from
Herbert
Pocket
that
the
spoon
is
not
generally
used
over-hand
,
but
under
.

In
the
Midwest
,
oxidation
ponds
are
used
extensively
for
the
treatment
of
domestic
sewage
from
suburban
areas
.

They
indicated
that
a
4-day
retention
,
aerated
lagoon
would
give
60
to
76
per
cent
BOD
reduction
.

Later
,
Eckenfelder
increased
the
efficiency
of
treatment
to
between
75
and
85
per
cent
in
the
summer
months
.

The
sewage
system
from
Kansas
City
was
not
expected
to
serve
the
Red
Bridge
area
for
several
years
.

For
the
initial
development
an
oxidation
pond
was
constructed
as
shown
in
Figure
1
.

The
oxidation
pond
has
a
surface
area
of
4.77
acres
and
a
depth
of
4
Aj
.

It
was
possible
to
maintain
aerobic
conditions
in
the
pond
by
regular
additions
of
sodium
nitrate
until
the
temperature
decreased
and
the
algae
population
changed
from
blue-green
to
green
algae
.

The
sewage
flow
into
the
treatment
plant
was
metered
and
continuously
recorded
on
24-hr.
charts
.

The
effluent
was
collected
through
two
pipes
and
discharged
to
the
Blue
River
through
a
surface
drainage
ditch
.

Composite
samples
were
collected
at
weekly
intervals
.

The
BOD
of
the
influent
to
the
pilot
plant
varied
between
110
and
710
with
an
average
of
350
Aj
.

The
BOD
of
the
raw
sewage
was
typical
of
domestic
sewage
from
a
subdivision
.

Examination
of
the
data
in
Table
1
,
shows
that
a
few
samples
contributed
to
raising
the
effluent
Aj
.

Ice
caused
the
aerator
to
overload
,
straining
the
drive
belts
.

It
seems
that
the
aerated
lagoon
was
a
very
heavily
loaded
oxidation
pond
or
a
lightly
loaded
activated
sludge
system
.

The
retention
period
in
the
aerated
lagoon
ranged
from
9.8
to
2.6
days
,
averaging
6.4
days
.

The
average
volatile
suspended
solids
in
the
effluent
was
75
while
MLSS
averaged
170
volatile
suspended
solids
.

The
oxygen
uptake
rate
in
the
mixed
liquor
averaged
0.8
during
the
first
four
months
of
this
study
.

The
increase
in
oxygen
uptake
rates
from
1.2
to
2.6
which
followed
an
increase
in
rotor
speed
was
believed
to
be
related
to
resuspension
of
solids
which
had
settled
at
the
lower
rotor
speeds
.

Very
little
protozoa
activity
existed
below
40-degrees-F
.

It
was
approximately
one
month
before
the
belt
problem
was
noticed
and
corrected
,
but
at
no
time
was
there
a
deficiency
of
dissolved
oxygen
.

A
series
of
eight
special
tests
were
conducted
at
different
rotor
speeds
to
determine
the
oxygen
transfer
rate
.

Five
of
the
tests
were
conducted
with
a
polyethylene
cover
to
simulate
an
ice
cover
.

Shortly
after
this
study
ended
septic
conditions
resulted
which
required
the
addition
of
sodium
nitrate
.

The
BOD
data
are
given
in
Table
4
.

When
the
algae
began
to
build
up
again
,
the
effluent
BOD
rose
.

Fixed
installations
offer
possibilities
for
area
detection
.

Mine
warfare
is
being
reoriented
against
submarine
targets
.

Proponents
of
single
elements
tend
to
ensure
predominance
of
that
element
without
determining
if
it
is
justified
,
and
the
element
with
the
most
enthusiastic
and
vociferous
proponents
has
assumed
the
greatest
importance
.

Principles
involved
in
an
over-all
concept

Communist
target
areas
can
be
assumed
,
but
there
is
no
certainty
that
such
assumptions
coincide
with
Soviet
intentions
.

Attack
can
come
from
almost
any
direction
against
many
locations
.

Destruction
of
the
enemy's
building
and
base
complex
,
however
,
requires
attacks
on
enemy
territory
,
which
is
possible
only
in
event
of
all-out
hostilities
.

The
Communists
are
adept
at
utilizing
hostilities
short
of
general
war
and
will
do
so
whenever
it
is
to
their
advantage
.

Antisubmarine
warfare
does
not
involve
clashes
between
large
opposing
forces
,
with
the
decision
a
result
of
a
single
battle
.

Therefore
,
the
third
principle
of
the
plan
must
be
that
it
does
not
depend
for
effectiveness
on
engagement
by
the
same
types
,
unless
at
an
assured
favorable
exchange
rate
.

Numbers
would
be
astronomical
and
current
fiscal
policies
make
this
an
impractical
solution
.

Supporting
elements
in
asw
operations

Before
considering
these
elements
in
more
detail
,
an
additional
requirement
should
be
stated
.

Environmental
intelligence
is
just
as
important
.

Full
knowledge
of
the
science
of
oceanography
can
bring
the
environment
to
our
side
,
resulting
in
an
increase
in
effectiveness
of
equipment
and
tactics
,
a
decrease
in
enemy
capabilities
,
and
the
development
of
methods
of
capitalizing
on
the
environment
.

Approaching
this
problem
on
a
statistical
basis
is
invalid
,
because
the
opponent
has
the
same
sources
available
and
will
be
encountered
not
under
average
conditions
,
but
under
the
conditions
most
advantageous
to
him
.

Progress
in
predicting
water
conditions
is
encouraging
,
but
little
guidance
is
available
to
the
man
at
sea
on
the
use
of
such
information
.

They
are
still
considered
to
be
for
use
in
restricted
waters
,
however
,
and
targets
must
come
within
a
few
yards
of
them
.

they
are
difficult
to
counter
,
cost
little
to
maintain
until
required
,
and
can
be
put
into
place
quickly
.

More
extended
systems
,
covering
all
passage
into
the
Caribbean
,
would
free
the
Caribbean
and
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
from
the
previously
listed
requirements
.

The
advantages
inherent
in
mine
warfare
justify
as
great
an
importance
for
this
element
as
is
accorded
any
of
the
other
elements
.

But
the
submarine
is
a
weapon
of
ambush
and
therefore
always
in
danger
of
being
ambushed
.

The
non-identity
of
serum
and
red
blood
cell
arylesterase
was
also
established
.

Furthermore
,
the
hydrolysis
of
paraoxon
was
studied
in
mammalian
sera
,
and
it
was
found
that
it
is
hydrolyzed
by
albumin
(
or
a
factor
attached
to
it
)
in
addition
to
arylesterase
.

It
was
observed
that
EWC
macromolecules
are
the
same
diameter
(
15
a.
)
but
much
longer
(
up
to
several
microns
)
than
vertebrate
tropocollagen
.

By
strengthening
the
differentiability
assumption
,
it
has
been
possible
to
derive
second
and
higher
order
theories
of
viscoelasticity
.

--
An
extensive
series
of
measurements
was
made
on
a
high-density
polyethylene
in
a
torsion
pendulum
instrument
using
forced
sinusoidal
oscillation
,
free
vibration
,
and
creep
measurements
over
the
temperature
range
of
Af
to
80-degrees-C
.

As
many
as
seven
decades
of
the
time
scale
were
thus
covered
isothermally
.

It
was
possible
,
however
,
to
decompose
the
compliance
into
a
sum
of
a
frequency-independent
component
and
two
viscoelastic
mechanisms
,
each
compatible
with
the
Boltzmann
superposition
principle
and
with
a
consistent
set
of
time-temperature
equivalence
factors
.

In
conformity
with
this
conclusion
a
higher
trace
gallium
content
was
found
in
the
portion
(
flange
)
that
has
undergone
a
second
melting
.

No
meteorites
have
ever
been
recovered
from
paleoexplosion
craters
,
and
recent
craters
containing

glass
have
all
been
produced
by
metallic
meteorites

the
exception
of
Aouelloul

structures

properties

and
reactions
of
these
compounds

being
studied

Recent
theoretical
work
to
calculate
the
dimensions
of
polymeric
chains
by
Volkenstein

Lifson
has
been
extended
to
include
more
general

The
crystallization
of
copolymers
comprising
Af
units
interspersed
with
a
minor
percentage
of
Af
is
limited
by
the
inability
of
the
crystal
lattice
characteristic
of
the
former
to
accommodate
the
bulky
side
group
of
the
latter
.

Limitations
on
the
lengths
of
these
sequences
diminish
the
stability
of
the
comparatively
short
crystallites
which
can
be
formed
,
and
this
is
reflected
in
a
broadening
of
the
melting
range
.

The

the

The

the
Dana
Mineralogies
dates
back
to
1844
when
they
published
the
second
edition

)
The
two
volumes
are
available
from
the
publisher
for
$14.00
and
$16.00
,
respectively
.

Ray
Pepinsky
is
the
Director
.

In
this
way
a
degree
of
unification
of
nomenclature
,
symbols
,
and
units
will
be
realized
.

The
basic
objectives
in
each
instance
are
to
make
available
supplies
of
food
during
the
intervals
between
harvesting
or
slaughter
,
to
minimize
losses
resulting
from
the
action
of
microorganisms
and
insects
,
and
to
make
it
possible
to
transport
foods
from
the
area
of
harvest
or
production
to
areas
of
consumption
.

An
early
hope
that
irradiation
might
be
the
ultimate
answer
to
practically
all
food
preservation
problems
was
soon
dispelled
.

It
furnishes
a
means
of
destroying
insects
in
stored
grain
products
as
well
as
certain
parasitic
organisms
present
in
meats
.

Radiation
does
not
retard
the
chemical
spoilage
of
food
.

For
radiopasteurization
,
to
partially
destroy
microorganisms
;
;

results
vary
with
types
of
food
,
storage
conditions
,
and
objectives
of
treatment
--
commonly
of
the
order
of
0.2
Mrads
but
up
to
about
0.8
Aj
.

For
irradiation
of
food
,
the
results
obtained
depend
upon
the
dose
rather
than
the
specific
type
of
radiation
,
and
X-ray
,
gamma
,
and
high-energy
electron
radiation
are
suitable
.

What
are
the
possibilities
of
lowered
radiation
production
costs
for
the
future
?
?

Because
agricultural
activities
are
seasonal
and
the
areas
of
production
and
harvest
of
many
foods
are
widely
scattered
geographically
,
and
because
of
the
high
cost
of
transporting
bulk
food
items
any
substantial
distance
to
a
central
processing
location
,
the
use
of
large
central
processing
stations
,
where
low-cost
radiation
facilities
approaching
the
megawatt
range
might
be
utilized
,
is
inherently
impracticable
.

Radiopasteurization
,
which
produces
fewer
adverse
sensory
changes
in
food
products
,
has
potential
usefulness
in
prolonging
the
keeping
qualities
of
fresh
and
refrigerated
food
items
.

To
date
,
the
one
meat
showing
favorable
results
at
sterilization
doses
is
pork
.

Tests
with
beef
have
been
largely
unsuccessful
because
of
the
development
of
off-flavors
.

A
prime
objective
of
the
Army
Quartermaster
Corps
program
is
to
find
the
reasons
for
beef's
low
palatability
and
means
of
overcoming
it
,
since
it
is
a
major
and
desirable
dietary
item
.

When
lamb
and
mutton
are
irradiated
at
substerilization
doses
,
the
meat
becomes
dehydrated
,
the
fat
becomes
chalky
,
and
,
again
,
unnatural
changes
in
color
occur
.

Specialty
cooked
items
containing
meat
portions
,
as
in
frozen
dinners
might
offer
a
potential
use
for
radiopasteurization
.

Irradiation
using
the
nuclide
source
is
more
expensive
than
use
of
an
electron
accelerator
.

Acceptance
of
radiopasteurization
is
likely
to
be
delayed
,
however
,
for
two
reasons
:
(
1
)
the
storage
life
of
fresh
chicken
under
refrigeration
is
becoming
a
minimal
problem
because
of
constantly
improved
sanitation
and
distributing
practices
,
and
(
2
)
treatment
by
antibiotics
,
a
measure
already
approved
by
the
Federal
Food
and
Drug
Administration
,
serves
to
extend
the
storage
life
of
chicken
at
a
low
cost
of
about
0.5
cents
per
pound
.

Although
refrigeration
has
served
to
extend
the
storage
life
of
these
products
,
substantially
increased
consumption
might
be
possible
if
areas
remote
from
the
seacoast
could
be
served
adequately
.

Furthermore
,
it
has
made
an
exact
assessment
of
the
removal
mechanisms
possible
.

The
measurement
of
topcoats
on
primers
can
also
readily
be
carried
out
.

Hesiometer
results
have
been
found
to
compare
excellently
with
manual
knife
scratching
tests
.

It
can
be
seen
from
Fig.
2
that
the
cutting
removal
of
a
coating
from
its
substrate
involves
pure
cohesive
failure
of
the
coating
.

If
the
force
required
to
remove
the
coatings
is
plotted
against
film
thickness
,
a
graph
as
illustrated
schematically
in
Fig.
5
may
characteristically
result
.

It
can
be
seen
that
the
force
is
characteristic
of
the
removal
process
and
changes
abruptly
from
cutting
to
cracking
to
peeling
removal
.

Af
is
the
force
required
to
cut
a
coating
of
thickness
T
from
the
substrate
.

Af
is
the
shear
force
along
the
shear
plane
;
;

Af
is
the
normal
compressive
force
acting
on
the
shear
plane
;
;

It
is
difficult
to
measure
the
direction
and
magnitude
of
R
directly
.

This
reduces
to
the
relationship
:
Af
,
where
Af
is
the
intercept
at
zero
thickness
of
the
extrapolation
of
the
slope
indicated
in
eqn.
(
1
)
,
Af
is
the
thickness
of
the
coating
equivalent
to
the
rounding
off
of
the
knife
tip
,
Af
is
a
straight
line
first
approximation
of
this
roundness
,
and
the
other
symbols
are
equivalent
to
those
of
eqn.
(
1
)
.

The
blunter
the
knife
,
the
higher
is
the
value
of
Af
.

Softer
knives
would
blunt
very
rapidly
,
making
the
value
of
Af
inexact
.

This
is
not
a
constant
value
like
Af
,
but
varies
with
the
thickness
of
the
coating
and
the
direction
and
magnitude
of
the
resultants
R
and
Af
of
Fig.
6
.

Chipping
mechanism
of
cohesive
failure

Eventually
,
rupture
occurs
along
the
shear
plane
(
9e
)
,
and
the
cycle
repeats
itself
.

Within
only
a
few
years
,
foamed
plastics
materials
have
managed
to
grow
into
an
integral
,
and
important
,
phase
of
the
plastics
industry
--
and
the
end
is
still
not
yet
in
sight
.

As
this
issue
goes
to
press
,
for
example
,
one
manufacturer
has
announced
an
epoxy
foam
with
outstanding
buoyancy
and
impact
strength
;
;

Much
interest
has
also
been
expressed
in
new
techniques
for
processing
the
urethane
foams
,
including
spraying
,
frothing
,
and
molding
(
see
article
,
p.
391
for
details
)
.

Two
other
end-use
areas
which
contributed
to
expandable
styrene's
growth
during
the
year
were
packaging
(
molded
inserts
replacing
complicated
cardboard
units
)
and
foamed-core
building
panels
.

Several
companies
also
saw
possibilities
in
using
the
technique
for
extruding
or
molding
vinyl
products
with
a
slight
cellular
core
that
would
reduce
costs
yet
would
not
affect
physical
properties
of
the
end
product
to
any
great
extent
.

Furniture
upholstery
,
as
just
one
example
,
can
easily
take
millions
of
pounds
;
;

and
use
of
the
foam
for
garment
interlining
is
only
now
getting
off
the
ground
,
with
volume
potential
in
the
offing
.

These
are
still
in
wide
use
today
,
particularly
in
semi-rigid
formulations
,
for
such
applications
as
cores
for
sandwich-type
structural
panels
,
foamed-in-place
insulation
,
automotive
safety
padding
,
arm
rests
,
etc.
.

the
polyether
group
generally
consists
of
foams
produced
with
polypropylene
glycol
or
polypropylene
glycol
modified
with
a
triol
.

One
shot
vs.
prepolymer

The
single
curve
line
represents
a
specific
formulation
in
a
test
example
.

By
varying
the
formula
,
this
curve
may
be
moved
forward
or
backward
along
the
coordinates
to
produce
any
desired
compression
strength
density
ratio
.

Thermal
conductivity
is
directly
traceable
to
the
material's
porous
,
air-cell
construction
which
effectively
traps
air
or
a
gas
in
the
maze
of
minute
bubbles
which
form
its
composition
.

The
foam
can
be
made
into
slab
stock
and
cut
to
shape
,
it
can
be
molded
,
it
can
be
poured-in-place
,
it
can
be
applied
by
spray
guns
,
etc.
.

Basically
,
the
foam
machines
that
produce
such
stock
consist
of
two
or
more
pumping
units
,
a
variable
mixer
,
a
nozzle
carriage
assembly
,
and
,
in
many
cases
,
a
conveyor
belt
to
transport
and
contain
the
liquid
during
the
reaction
process
and
until
it
solidifies
into
foam
.

Profile
cutting
machines
are
available
which
can
split
foam
to
any
desired
thickness
and
produce
sine
,
triangle
,
trapezoid
,
and
other
profiles
in
variable
heights
,
dimensions
,
etc.
.

The
160-ml.
bath
containing
the
calculated
amount
of
detergent
is
applied
slowly
and
directly
to
the
running
specimen
.

At
the
conclusion
of
the
washing
,
8
liters
of
water
at
90-degrees-F
(
32*0C.
)
are
automatically
metered
from
the
rinse
reservoir
to
the
washing
tubs
,
4
liters
to
each
tub
.

The
run
is
complete
when
all
the
water
has
drained
off
into
the
waste
line
.

Four
washing
test
procedures
are
established
,
varying
in
severity
from
very
severe
to
very
mild
,
and
are
intended
to
cover
the
range
of
practical
washing
from
commercial
procedure
to
hand
washing
.

Three
methods
for
determining
the
dimensional
restorability
characteristics
are
established
for
those
textiles
which
require
restoration
by
ironing
or
wearing
after
laundering
.

These
tests
are
not
accelerated
and
must
be
repeated
to
evaluate
dimensional
changes
after
repeated
launderings
.

It
is
possible
to
identify
the
test
procedure
completely
with
a
code
consisting
of
a
Roman
Numeral
,
a
letter
,
and
an
Arabic
number
.

For
example
Test

,
E

refers
to
a
specimen
which
has
been
washed
by
procedure

(
(
at
160-degrees-F
)
for
a
total
of
60
minutes

the
machine
,
has
been
dried
in
a
tumble

Drying
procedures
and
application
of
restorative
force
procedures
are
varied
to
conform
with
end-use
handling
during
home
or
commercial
laundering
.

One
fin
is
located
every
120-degrees
around
the
inside
diameter
of
the
wheel
.

The
machine
is
equipped
with
a
pipe
for
injecting
live
steam
that
is
capable
of
raising
the
temperature
of
water
at
an
eight-inch
level
from
110-degrees
to
140-degrees-F
(
38*0
to
60*0C.
)
in
less
than
two
minutes
.

It
is
equipped
with
an
outside
water
gauge
that
will
indicate
the
level
of
the
water
in
the
wheel
.

The
wash
wheel
is
the
equipment
preferred
for
the
test
.

The
flat-bed
press
is
maintained
at
a
temperature
not
less
than
275-degrees-F
(
135*0C.
)
.

The
dryer
is
provided
with
a
means
of
maintaining
a
drying
temperature
of
120-degrees
-
160-degrees-F
(
49*0

)
,
measured
in
the

Two
of
the
clamps
are
fixed
to
the
edges
of
the
board
whereas
two
clamps
travel
on
guide
rails
opposite
the
fixed
clamps
.

A
special
template
is
furnished
with
the
apparatus
to
enable
marking
a
specimen
for
a
central
measuring
area
and
the
fabric
extensions
to
the
clamps
(
see
Fig.

)
.

Each
pin
is
individually
sprung
to
a
tensioning
member
which
is
driven
outwardly
in
the
slot
.

The
markings
consist
of
a
centrally
located
10
inch
diameter
measuring
circle
and
a
14
inch
diameter
circle
of
20
dots
equidistantly
spaced
(
See

)
.

The
washing
procedures
are
summarized
in
Table

of
the
time
shown
in
Column
C
of
Table

Run
the
machine
continuously
until
completion
of
the

When
this
water

has
been
reached
inject
steam

High-gain
photoelectronic
image
intensification
may
be
achieved
by
several
methods
;
;

some
of
these
are
listed
below
:
(
A
)

Cascading
single
stages
by
coupling
lens
systems
,
(
B
)

Transmission
secondary
electron
multiplication
image
intensifiers
(
TSEM
tubes
)
,
(
E
)

Channel-type
image
intensifiers
are
capable
of
achieving
high-gain
values
;
;

they
suffer
,
however
,
from
an
inherently
low
resolution
.

These
tubes
may
differ
both
in
the
choice
of
the
electron
optical
system
and
in
the
design
of
the
coupling
members
.

The
electron
optical
system
may
be
either
a
magnetic
or
electrostatic
one
.

As
it
will
be
discussed
later
,
peripheral
defocusing
can
be
improved
on
by
utilizing
curved
fiber
couplers
.

The
conclusion
shall
be
reached
that
fiber-coupled
,
double-stage
tubes
represent
a
sensible
and
practical
approach
to
high-gain
image
intensification
.

The
electron
optical
system
(
see
fig.
14-1
)
is
based
in
principle
on
the
focusing
action
of
concentric
spherical
cathode
and
anode
surfaces
.

The
cylindrical
focusing
electrode
permits
adjustment
of
the
positive
lens
part
by
varying
the
focusing
potential
.

Theoretical
discussion
of
flux
gain

numerical
aperture
(
N.A.
)
;
;

packing
efficiency
(
F.R.
)
.

A
sufficiently
good
approximation
for
determining
the
end
reflection
losses
R
can
be
obtained
from
the
angle
independent
Fresnel
formula
:
Af
.

For
phosphor
to
fiber
and
fiber
to
air
surfaces
,
and
assuming
Af
,
we
obtain
Af
percent
.

Hence
,
the
Af
factor
for
the
output
fiber
coupler
is
Af
.

The
internal
losses
are
due
to
absorption
and
the
small
but
finite
losses
suffered
in
the
numerous
internal
reflections
due
to
deviations
from
the
prescribed
,
cylindrical
fiber
cross-section
and
minute
imperfections
of
the
core-jacket
interface
.

Since
we
are
considering
here
relatively
small
diameter
(
1
-
1.5
inches
)
fiber
plates
,
their
average
thickness
can
be
kept
below
inch
and
their
internal
losses
may
be
assumed
as
15
percent
(
per
plate
)
.

For
circular
fibers
in
a
closely
packed
hexagonal
array
,
the
packing
efficiency
is
given
by
:
Af
where
Af
,
and
0.906
is
the
ratio
of
the
area
of
a
circle
to
that
of
the
circumscribed
hexagon
.

The
cladding
thickness
is
about
0.5
M
,
hence
,
Af
and
Af
.

Thus
,
the
combined
efficiency
of
the
elements
replaced
by
the
two
fiber
plates
(
with
a
combined
efficiency
of
0.25
)
is
0.043
or
about
six
times
less
than
that
of
the
two
fiber
plates
.

The
input
light
distributions
considered
are
P-11
and
P-20
phosphor
emission
and
the
so-called
night
light
(
N.L.
)
as
given
by
H.W.
Babcock
and
J.
J.
Johnson
.

(
The
P-20
input
is
of
interest
because
it
corresponds
roughly
to
the
light
emission
of
conventional
X-ray
fluorescent
screens
)
.

Space
charge
influences
will
also
decrease
at
increased
voltages
.

The
inherent
resolution
of
a
cathodoluminescent
phosphor
screen
decreases
with
increasingly
aggregate
thickness
(
with
increasing
anode
voltage
)
,
decreases
with
decreasing
porosity
(
thus
the
advantage
of
cathodophoretic
phosphor
deposition
)
and
might
be
impaired
by
the
normally
used
aluminum
mirror
.

Thus
,
in
general
,
elementary
light
optical
effects
,
light
scatter
,
and
electron
scatter
determine
the
obtainable
resolution
limit
.

An
optimal
policy
is
one
which
in
some
sense
gets
the
best
out
of
the
process
as
a
whole
by
maximizing
the
value
of
the
product
.

There
are
thus
three
components
to
an
optimal
design
problem
:
(
1
)

The
specification
of
the
state
of
the
process
stream
;
;

For
the
second
we
might
have
to
choose
the
volume
of
reactor
or
amount
of
cooling
to
be
supplied
;
;

He
recognized
that
whatever
transformation
may
be
effected
in
the
first
stage
of
an
R-stage
process
,
the
remaining
stages
must
use
an
optimal
Af-stage
policy
with
respect
to
the
state
resulting
from
the
first
stage
,
if
there
is
to
be
any
chance
of
optimizing
the
complete
process
.

Moreover
,
by
systematically
varying
the
operating
conditions
in
the
first
stage
and
always
using
the
optimal
Af-stage
policy
for
the
remaining
stages
,
we
shall
eventually
find
the
optimal
policy
for
all
R
stages
.

Proceeding
in
this
way
,
from
one
to
two
and
from
two
to
three
stages
,
we
may
gradually
build
up
the
policy
for
any
number
.

If
the
problem
is
enlarged
to
require
a
complete
coverage
of
feed
states
,
Af
operations
are
needed
by
the
dynamic
program
and
Af
by
the
direct
search
.

At
the
same
time
,
every
device
that
can
be
employed
to
reduce
the
number
of
variables
is
of
the
greatest
value
,
and
it
is
one
of
the
attractive
features
of
dynamic
programming
that
room
is
left
for
ingenuity
in
using
the
special
features
of
the
problem
to
this
end
.

These
will
be
numbered
in
the
direction
opposite
to
the
flow
of
the
process
stream
,
so
that
stage
R
is
the
T
stage
from
the
end
.

Let
the
state
of
the
stream
leaving
stage
R
be
denoted
by
a
vector
Af
and
the
operating
variables
of
stage
R
by
Af
.

Each
stage
transforms
the
state
Af
of
its
feed
to
the
state
Af
in
a
way
that
depends
on
the
operating
variables
Af
.

This
will
result
in
a
value
Af
of
the
objective
function
,
and
when
Af
is
chosen
correctly
this
will
give
Af
,
the
maximum
of
the
objective
function
.

To
extract
the
optimal
R-stage
policy
with
respect
to
the
feed
state
Af
,
we
enter
section
R
of
this
table
at
the
state
Af
and
find
immediately
from
the
last
column
the
maximum
value
of
the
objective
function
.

It
may
be
that
the
objective
function
depends
not
only
on
Af
but
also
on
Af
,
as
when
the
cost
of
the
operating
policy
is
considered
.

If
Af
denotes
the
net
profit
from
stage
R
and
Af
,
then
the
principle
of
optimality
gives
Af
.

In
this
case
the
stage
R
operating
with
conditions
Af
transforms
the
state
of
the
stream
from
Af
to
Af
,
but
only
the
probability
distribution
of
Af
is
known
.

If
we
consider
a
process
in
which
the
outcome
of
one
stage
is
known
before
passage
to
the
next
,
then
the
principle
of
optimality
shows
that
the
policy
in
subsequent
stages
should
be
optimal
with
respect
to
the
outcome
of
the
first
.

The
type
of
presentation
of
results
used
in
the
deterministic
process
may
be
used
here
,
except
that
now
the
fourth
column
is
redundant
.

In
many
cases
it
is
not
possible
to
divide
the
process
into
a
finite
number
of
discrete
stages
,
since
the
state
of
the
stream
is
transformed
in
a
continuous
manner
through
the
process
.

A
gyro-stabilized
platform
system
,
using
restrained
gyros
,
is
well
suited
for
automatic
leveling
because
of
the
characteristics
of
the
gyro-platform-servo
combination
.

The
platform
angle
**yf
is
the
angle
about
which
the
gyro
is
controlling
.

i.e.
,
high
loop
gain
causes
the
system
to
respond
to
horizontal
components
of
accelerations
.

It
must
be
noticed
in
Fig.
7-1
that
the
accelerometer
responds
to
any
input
acceleration
.

When
the
system
is
arranged
for
automatic
leveling
,
the
platform
angles
respond
to
any
horizontal
components
of
acceleration
acting
on
the
accelerometers
.

The
amplifier
is
designed
so
that
its
gain
is
large
for
accelerometer
signals
above
a
certain
threshold
level
.

The
effect
is
that
the
platform
returns
from
an
off-level
position
at
a
rapid
rate
until
it
is
nearly
level
,
at
which
point
the
platform
is
controlled
by
a
proportional
servo
with
low
enough
frequency
response
so
that
the
noise
has
little
effect
on
the
leveling
process
.

The
automatic
leveling
system
described
in
this
section
is
readily
adaptable
to
a
gyro-stabilized
platform
consisting
of
three
integrating
gyros
.

This
leveling
system
will
hold
the
platform
on-level
,
automatically
,
as
long
as
the
system
is
actuated
.

Manual
leveling
requires
an
appropriate
display
of
the
accelerometer
outputs
.

However
,
skill
is
required
on
the
part
of
an
operator
to
level
a
platform
to
any
degree
of
accuracy
.

Also
,
it
requires
more
time
as
compared
to
the
automatic
approach
.

Platform
heading
consists
of
orienting
the
sensitive
axis
of
the
accelerometers
parallel
to
the
desired
coordinate
system
of
the
navigator
.

For
purely
inertial
navigators
,
two
techniques
are
available
to
accomplish
the
platform
heading
:
Use
of
external
or
surveying
equipment
to
establish
proper
heading
;
;

The
sighting
procedure
includes
the
use
of
a
fixture
for
the
transit
to
project
a
beam
of
light
,
which
is
darkened
by
crossed
hairs
,
on
the
accelerometer
mirror
.

If
the
drift
error
is
systematic
,
it
can
be
canceled
with
a
bias
circuit
which
can
be
arranged
and
adjusted
to
supply
the
required
compensating
current
.

Figure
7-3
shows
a
platform
system
with
the
gyro
vectors
arranged
as
described
above
.

His
teacher
and
his
school
principal
were
conferred
with
and
everyone
agreed
that
,
if
he
kept
up
with
a
certain
amount
of
work
at
home
,
there
was
little
danger
of
his
losing
a
term
.

The
blueberry
pie
is
good
,
Scotty
.

I
recommend
it
.

Scotty
regarded
the
ear
and
the
grizzled
hair
around
it
with
a
moment
of
interest
.

He
had
eaten
almost
nothing
on
the
crested
,
three-sectioned
plate
and
had
drunk
about
half
the
milk
in
its
paper
container
.

He's
all
right
,
Craig
,
Rachel
said
.

He
breathed
now
with
his
mouth
open
,
showing
a
whitely
curving
section
of
lower
teeth
;
;

It
was
a
strained
,
silent
lunch
.

Rachel
said
,
I'd
better
get
him
to
bed
.

It
was
a
Negro
section
of
peeling
row
houses
,
store-front
churches
and
ragged
children
.

He
said
,
Nothing
.

Scotty
looked
at
the
children
,
his
mouth
slightly
opened
,
his
eyes
dull
.

the
days
seemed
short
,
perhaps
because
his
routine
was
,
each
day
,
almost
the
same
.

It'll
take
time
.

his
mouth
hung
slightly
open
.

When
he
was
asked
a
question
or
addressed
in
such
a
way
that
some
response
was
inescapable
,
he
would
answer
;
;

He
had
not
even
thought
about
her
much
except
once
or
twice
at
night
in
bed
when
his
slowly
ranging
thoughts
would
abruptly
,
almost
accidentally
,
encounter
her
.

it
was
merely
another
part
of
his
weakness
.

Kate's
all
right
.

By
the
time
he
was
under
the
covers
he
had
forgotten
about
seeing
Kate
.

his
delicate
hand
,
as
veined
as
a
moth's
wing
,
rested
absently
on
Scotty's
chest
.

Well
,
we
are
taking
a
little
vacation
,
that's
all
.

it
would
exhaust
him
further
and
unnecessarily
.

I'll
drop
by
again
in
a
few
days
.

Rachel
stayed
on
after
the
doctor
had
gone
.

She
said
,
Do
you
think
you'll
miss
school
?
?

He
had
noticed
how
formal
and
irritably
exact
Rachel
had
grown
.

He
did
not
care
.

You
could
win
a
popularity
contest
at
that
school
without
any
trouble
.

Do
you
suppose
his
self-consciousness
is
characteristic
of
the
new
Negro
professionals
or
merely
of
doctors
in
general
?
?

I
mean
,
do
you
feel
like
seeing
Kate
?
?

Scotty
said
,
I
don't
know
.

She
put
the
slipper
neatly
by
its
mate
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.

This
time
Rachel
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
forehead
.

Or
:
Does
he
get
exercise
?
?

I
am
not
supposed
to
yet
.

he
felt
he
was
noting
it
,
as
if
it
were
something
he
might
think
about
when
he
grew
stronger
.

Between
the
ponderous
hulk
and
himself
,
in
the
valley
over
which
Papa-san
reigned
,
men
had
hidden
high
explosives
,
booby
traps
,
and
mines
.

Was
it
all
vain
labor
?
?

Was
this
what
he
had
expected
?
?

He
hadn't
realized
that
there
would
be
so
much
time
to
think
,
so
many
lulls
.

Now
he
knew
that
the
moment
illuminated
by
the
vision
on
the
train
would
have
to
be
approached
.

It
could
take
place
tomorrow
night
,
or
it
might
occur
months
from
now
.

He
hadn't
even
seen
him
yet

Others
carried
extra
clips
for
the
Browning
Automatic
Rifle
,
which
was
in
the
hands
of
a
little
Mexican
named
Martinez
.

Be
sure
the
man
nearest
you
is
awake
.

Then
we
pull
out
under
our
mortar
and
artillery
cover
,
but
nobody
pulls
out
until
I
say
so
.

Remember
what
I
said
about
going
out
to
get
anybody
left
behind
?
?

We
bring
back
all
dead
and
wounded
.

At
2130
hours
they
had
passed
through
the
barbed
wire
at
the
point
of
departure
.

Then
began
the
journey
through
their
own
mine
fields
.

On
their
right
rose
the
embankment
covered
with
brush
and
trees
.

Looming
over
all
,
Papa-san
leered
down
at
him
,
threatening
a
hundred
hidden
malevolencies
.

Off
in
the
distance
a
searchlight
flashed
on
,
its
beam
slashing
the
sky
.

The
sharp
ray
was
absorbed
by
a
cloud
,
then
reflected
to
the
earth
in
a
softer
,
diffused
radiance
.

Somewhere
over
there
another
patrol
had
need
of
light
.

White's
arm
went
up
and
Warren
raised
his
own
.

Prevot
came
up
.

Warren
handed
him
the
metal
box
and
Prevot
quietly
disappeared
down
the
line
.

The
others
likewise
had
hidden
themselves
in
the
grass
and
the
brush
.

Even
at
this
short
distance
they
were
only
vague
shapes
,
setting
up
the
machine
gun
on
a
small
knoll
so
that
it
could
fire
above
the
heads
of
the
rest
of
the
patrol
.

The
walk
and
his
fears
had
served
to
overheat
him
and
his
sweaty
armpits
cooled
at
the
touch
of
the
night
air
.

Although
the
armored
vest
fitted
the
upper
part
of
his
body
snugly
,
he
felt
no
security
.

Then
the
figures
which
held
his
attention
became
a
group
of
shattered
trees
,
standing
like
the
grotesques
of
a
medieval
damnation
scene
.

Sensing
the
unseen
presence
of
the
other
men
in
the
patrol
,
he
felt
mutely
united
to
these
nine
near-strangers
sharing
this
pinpoint
of
being
with
him
.

They
were
poems
in
a
strange
language
,
of
which
he
could
barely
touch
a
meaning
--
enough
to
make
his
being
ache
with
the
desire
for
the
fullness
he
sensed
there
.

Brittany
,
that
stone-gray
mystery
through
which
he
traveled
for
thirty
days
,
sleeping
in
the
barns
of
farmers
or
alongside
roads
,
had
worked
some
subtle
change
in
him
,
he
knew
,
and
it
was
in
Brittany
that
he
had
met
Pierre
.

He
took
the
pen
in
his
stumps
and
began
to
write
.

They
refuse
to
mention
or
to
notice
that
they
are
not
there
.

The
Americans
,
like
yourself
,
take
the
fact
for
granted
,
try
to
be
helpful
,
but
don't
ask
questions
.

It
will
be
good
for
you
.

Smiling
at
Warren's
protestations
,
the
old
monk
took
his
grip
from
him
and
led
him
down
a
corridor
to
a
small
parlor
.

Will
you
please
wait
in
here
.

Al's
Little
Cafe
was
small
,
dark
,
narrow
,
and
filled
with
the
mingled
scent
of
beer
,
tobacco
smoke
,
and
Italian
cooking
.

The
other
patrons
were
taxi
drivers
and
art
students
and
small
shopkeepers
.

His
friend
Jane
was
with
him
.

She
was
the
widow
of
a
writer
who
had
died
in
an
airplane
crash
,
and
Mickie
had
found
her
a
job
as
head
of
the
historical
section
of
the
Treasury
.

I
am
sure
all
girls
feel
this
way
about
men
until
they
live
with
them
.

Mr.
Christiansen
knows
that
a
soldier
will
get
the
Distinguished
Service
Medal
for
conduct
that
would
land
him
in
prison
for
life
or
the
electric
chair
as
a
civilian
.

I
heard
of
some
that
tried
it
back
in
the
States
,
and
he'd
knock
them
clear
across
the
room
.

There'd
been
a
pretty
bad
incident
back
at
the
Marine
base
.

They
caught
Trig
stealing
liquor
from
the
officers'
mess
,
and
he
got
a
couple
of
girls
in
trouble
.

Trig
was
one
of
the
five
volunteers
.

When
he
was
in
the
war
,
he
was
in
Law
or
Supplies
or
something
like
that
,
and
an
old
buddy
of
his
told
me
he
would
come
down
on
Sundays
to
the
Pentagon
and
read
the
citations
for
medals
--
just
like
the
one
we
sent
in
for
Trig
--
and
go
away
with
a
real
glow
.

He
thought
how
this
dainty
,
fragile
older
woman
threading
her
way
through
the
streets
of
Westminster
on
a
day
in
June
,
enjoying
the
flowers
in
the
shops
,
the
greetings
from
old
friends
,
but
never
really
drawing
a
deep
,
passionate
breath
,
was
so
like
himself
.

And
so
he
had
,
so
he
had
.

He
was
not
stone
.

He
had
to
teach
himself
patiently
that
these
traps
were
not
for
him
.

He
had
dared
to
defy
nature
,
to
turn
his
back
to
the
Lorelei
,
and
he
was
punished
.

Lawrence
was
waiting
for
Bill
Boxell
.

The
Secretary
was
uneasy
about
the
visit
.

A
half
hour
later
the
Vice
President
arrived
.

It
was
not
a
discourteous
question
,
Lawrence
decided
.

Again
,
Lawrence
thought
a
little
sadly
,
these
were
the
fees
of
poverty
and
ambition
.

He
had
to
acquire
everything
he
was
going
to
get
in
four
years
.

They
had
brandy
in
the
library
.

Lawrence
listened
with
the
practiced
,
deceptive
calm
of
the
lawyer
,
but
his
face
was
in
the
shadow
.

This
is
why
I
say
we
just
can't
go
ahead
and
disarm
the
Germans
and
pull
down
our
own
defenses
.

He's
telling
them
now
to
write
letters
to
their
Congressmen
opposing
the
disarmament
of
Germany
.

Then
they
went
down
to
Black
Bottom
.

For
the
old
preacher
who
had
been
there
twenty-five
years
was
dead
,
and
the
city
mourned
him
.

A
knot
of
old
worshippers
,
chiefly
women
,
listened
weekly
to
a
sermon
.

And
then
the
Amen
corner
took
hold
,
re-enacting
a
form
of
group
participation
in
worship
that
stemmed
from
years
before
the
Greek
chorus
,
spreading
down
through
the
African
forest
,
overseas
to
the
West
Indies
,
and
then
here
in
Alabama
.

To
most
of
those
who
composed
the
Amen
corner
it
was
a
magnificent
and
beautiful
experience
,
something
for
which
they
lived
from
week
to
week
.

It
was
often
re-enacted
in
less
wild
form
at
the
Wednesday
night
prayer
meeting
.

He
sympathized
with
them
on
the
loss
of
their
old
pastor
.

He
had
no
chance
to
say
another
word
.

During
the
next
weeks
he
looked
over
the
situation
.

It
was
arranged
that
he
would
board
in
the
home
of
one
of
the
old
members
of
the
church
,
a
woman
named
Catt
who
,
as
Wilson
afterward
found
,
was
briefly
referred
to
as
The
Cat
because
of
her
sharp
tongue
and
fierce
initiative
.

Ann
Catt
was
a
lonely
,
devoted
soul
,
never
married
,
conducting
a
spotless
home
and
devoted
to
her
church
,
but
a
perpetual
dissenter
and
born
critic
.

She
soared
over
the
new
pastor
like
an
avenging
angel
lest
he
stray
from
the
path
and
not
know
all
the
truth
and
gossip
of
which
she
was
chief
repository
.

It
was
dirty
and
neglected
.

The
school
was
small
,
dark
and
ill-equipped
.

The
teacher
was
a
pliant
fool
.

Wilson
was
told
that
it
was
a
sort
of
hotel
for
white
people
,
which
seemed
to
him
rather
queer
.

But
nevertheless
it
looked
respectable
.

The
rest
of
Black
Bottom
was
a
rabbit
warren
of
homes
in
every
condition
of
neglect
,
disrepair
and
careful
upkeep
.

After
looking
about
a
bit
,
Wilson
discovered
beyond
Black
Bottom
,
across
the
river
and
far
removed
from
the
white
city
,
a
considerable
tract
of
land
,
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
church
and
the
better
Negro
homes
might
gradually
be
moved
to
this
plot
.

He
was
not
sure
what
kind
of
a
man
he
had
in
hand
.

Then
Wilson
asked
,
What
about
this
Kent
House
which
you
mention
?
?

She
said
,
My
dear
,
do
you
know
what
Kent
House
is
?
?

They
buy
some
supplies
from
our
colored
grocers
and
they
are
patronized
by
some
of
the
best
white
gentlemen
in
town
.

The
backing
from
the
white
town
was
greater
and
there
was
little
publicity
.

Payne
dismounted
in
Madison
Place
and
handed
the
reins
to
Herold
.

No
one
would
question
such
an
errand
.

Like
the
bell
at
Mass
,
the
doorbell
was
pitched
too
high
.

It
was
still
Good
Friday
,
after
all
.

He
was
thinking
chiefly
of
Cap
.

He
had
no
idea
where
Seward's
room
would
be
.

Seward
would
be
up
there
.

Everything
would
be
all
right
.

It
was
a
thrill
he
felt
no
part
in
.

At
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
ran
into
somebody
standing
there
angrily
in
a
dressing
gown
.

Young
Frederick
Seward
held
out
his
hand
.

Frederick
Seward
said
his
father
was
sleeping
,
and
then
went
through
a
pantomime
at
his
father's
door
,
to
prove
the
statement
.

It
was
the
first
blow
that
was
always
difficult
.

He
got
caught
up
into
it
and
became
a
different
person
.

Payne
was
more
methodical
than
that
.

He
smashed
it
in
and
tumbled
into
darkness
.

Another
man
approached
,
this
one
fully
dressed
.

But
he
was
not
mad
.

He
clattered
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
door
.

The
nigger
boy
was
close
behind
him
.

He
rode
on
and
on
.

On
a
stage
he
always
knew
what
to
do
,
and
tonight
,
to
judge
by
the
applause
,
he
must
be
doing
it
better
than
usual
.

That
was
one
of
the
high
spots
of
the
play
.

If
he
had
any
worries
,
it
was
only
the
small
ones
,
about
Mother
in
New
York
,
and
his
daughter
Edwina
and
what
she
might
be
doing
at
this
hour
,
with
her
Aunt
Asia
,
in
Philadelphia
.

Wilkes
was
quite
right
about
one
thing
.

That
was
when
the
gun
went
off
.

Guns
were
going
off
all
over
Washington
City
these
days
,
because
of
the
celebrations
,
and
the
theatre
was
not
soundproof
.

But
it
also
looked
like
a
toad
,
hopping
away
from
the
light
.

When
something
unexpected
happened
,
one
always
asked
for
water
if
one
were
a
woman
,
brandy
if
one
were
a
man
.

Mrs.
Lincoln
screamed
again
.

At
the
rear
of
the
auditorium
,
upstairs
,
some
men
tried
to
push
open
the
door
to
the
box
corridor
.

It
would
not
give
.

As
usual
,
Mrs.
Lincoln
had
lost
her
head
,
but
nobody
blamed
her
for
doing
so
now
.

Rathbone
said
he
was
bleeding
to
death
.

Katie
reared
a
third
time
,
then
,
trembling
,
descended
.

He
gloated
,
and
his
lips
slavered
.

They
rode
around
and
around
to
trample
the
figure
into
the
sand
.

Instantly
,
he
chilled
.

They
were
pursuing
him
.

The
clock
which
had
struck
presented
an
innocent
face
.

There's
a
tower
and
a
steeple
on
the
church
a
million
feet
high
.

I
know
,
Stephen
,
she
smiled
.

He
crossed
Broome
Street
to
Orange
Square
.

The
spire
seemed
to
hold
up
the
sky
.

To
know
God
he
must
follow
in
Papa's
footsteps
.

He
was
fortunate
,
and
proud
.

South
of
Laurel
Grove
Cemetery
,
and
below
the
junction
of
the
Neversink
and
the
Delaware
,
was
the
Tri-State
Rock
,
from
which
Stevie
could
spy
New
Jersey
and
Pennsylvania
,
as
well
as
New
York
,
simply
by
spinning
around
on
his
heel
.

Where
Cuddleback
Brook
purled
into
the
Neversink
was
a
magnificent
swimming
hole
.

Papa
pointed
a
scornful
finger
at
the
splashing
youth
:
Idle
recreation
!
!

Stevie
saw
no
idols
;
;

Where
you
been
today
?
?

No
,
he
won't
!
!

It
could
never
happen
as
long
as
God
was
alert
and
the
Drew
steeple
stood
guard
with
its
peaked
lance
.

The
boy
shuddered
at
the
deathly
pale
countenance
with
its
wrinkles
and
gray
hair
.

Open
your
heart
to
Him
and
pray
,
Stephen
,
pray
!
!

For
he
feared
the
Lake
of
Fire
.

Burt
was
at
Hackettstown
and
Will
at
Albany
Law
School
,
where
they
surely
could
not
hear
it
.

He
would
hear
the
Call
and
would
run
to
tell
Papa
.

if
he
missed
it
,
never
again
.

he
dared
to
wait
for
the
lightning
.

But
he
was
good
.

He
would
save
her
.

When
the
sun
came
out
,
Stevie
strode
proudly
into
Orange
Square
,
smiling
like
a
landlord
on
industrious
tenants
.

The
fountain
had
brimmed
over
,
the
cannon
were
wet
,
the
soldiers'
monument
glistened
.

Ludie
took
his
slingshot
and
climbed
to
the
rooftop
to
shoot
at
crows
.

He
,
too
,
cocked
his
cap
at
a
jaunty
angle
,
jingled
marbles
in
his
pocket
,
and
swaggered
down
Main
Street
.

Stevie
yearned
for
a
dog
.

He
meandered
down
Pike
Street
,
past
the
First
National
Bank
with
its
green
window
shades
.

He
crossed
the
tracks
to
Delaware
House
,
where
ladies
in
gay
dresses
and
men
in
straw
boaters
and
waxed
mustaches
crowded
the
verandah
.

A
tall
lady
,
with
a
ruffled
collar
very
low
on
her
bosom
,
turned
insolent
green
eyes
upon
him
.

P.
J.
--
as
Ludie
called
the
town
--
was
crowded
with
summer
people
who
came
to
the
mountains
to
escape
the
heat
in
the
big
cities
.

Man
,
how
I
love
nigger
pussy
!
!

Only
one
worth
a
shit
,
and
that's
Brandon
.

Soon
came
back
to
his
senses
.

I
soon
came
back
to
my
senses
,
he
said
,
aloud
,
to
the
young
blizzard
,
proudly
,
drawing
himself
up
,
as
if
making
a
report
to
some
important
superior
.

But
I
told
him
,
goddammit
.

I
told
him
,
he
said
aloud
They'll
get
the
guys
that
done
it
.

Prickly
twinges
of
annoyance
ran
through
him
.

His
eyes
blinked
hard
,
snapping
on
and
squashing
some
bad
things
that
were
trying
to
push
their
way
into
him
.

One
of
his
favorites
:
Guitar
Boogie
.

Hired
,
hard
lackeys
of
the
Warmongering
capitalists
.

Really
something
,
he
said
,
aloud
.

The
thought
came
back
,
the
one
nagging
at
him
these
past
four
days
.

But
the
words
were
forming
.

Somebody'll
hafta
start
thinkin
.

The
music
arrived
,
taking
him
its
rhythm
.

Jesus
,
the
guy
says
he
is
trying
.

Sleepy-eyed
,
soft-spoken
Johnson
,
Biggest
thorn
in
my
side
of
the
whole
fucken
squad
.

Why
couldn't
they
have
dumped
him
off
on
someone
else
?
?

A
gnawing
and
gnashing
within
him
.

Jesus
,
imagine
,
the
crummy
bastards
,
they'll
get
em
,
they'll
get
what's
comin
to
em
.

See
,
he's
already
snapping
it
up
,
the
dumb
jerk
.

It
made
no
sense
to
him
.

Is
this
for
real
?
?

How
long
did
you
study
?
?

Don't
Christsake
me
,
buddy
!
!

That's
a
good
one
.

Why
don't
Uncle
Sam
mind
his
own
fucken
business
?
?

If
I
hafta
do
this
to
stay
alive
by
God
I'll
do
it
.

I
hated
the
goddamn
army
from
the
first
day
I
got
in
anyhow
.

He
snuggled
into
the
blanket
.

A
river
,
wide
as
the
Missouri
,
where
it
ran
by
his
place
.

(
he
asked
this
out
loud
,
but
no
one
heard
it
over
the
other
noise
in
the
hut
)
.

Over
on
the
bank
,
the
west
bank
,
a
man
stood
,
calling
to
him
.

For
it
is
such
a
distinguished
place
,
with
such
fine
works
of
art
and
such
a
big
library
,
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
that
the
owner
has
become
depraved
by
all
this
culture
.

Could
he
have
pen
and
paper
,
please
?
?

Ever
since
he
had
first
begun
to
study
music
and
to
teach
it
,
Rousseau
had
dreamed
of
piercing
through
to
fame
as
the
result
of
a
successful
opera
.

But
his
facility
in
this
genre
was
not
great
.

His
operatic
music
had
little
merit
.

And
they
wouldn't
leave
off
arguing
and
pleading
until
he
had
promised
.

That
after
all
his
years
of
effort
to
become
a
composer
,
he
should
now
,
now
when
he
was
still
stoutly
replying
to
the
critics
of
his
Discourse
on
the
Arts
and
Sciences
,
be
so
close
to
a
success
in
music
and
have
to
reject
it
.

But
what
else
could
he
do
?
?

These
little
songs
,
however
,
were
sweet
nothings
from
the
heart
,
tender
memories
of
his
childhood
,
little
melodies
that
anyone
could
hum
and
that
would
make
one
want
to
weep
.

The
musicians
of
the
Royal
Opera
would
not
rehearse
a
work
merely
to
see
how
it
would
sound
.

Afraid
at
one
and
the
same
time
that
his
work
might
be
turned
down
--
which
would
be
a
blow
to
his
pride
even
though
no
one
knew
he
was
the
author
--
and
that
the
work
would
be
accepted
,
and
then
that
his
violent
feelings
in
the
matter
would
certainly
betray
how
deeply
concerned
he
was
in
spite
of
himself
.

And
how
anxious
this
lover
of
obscurity
was
for
applause
!
!

What
else
could
I
do
?
?

How
infuriating
all
this
was
!
!

Now
,
when
everything
was
opening
up
to
him
--
even
the
court
of
Louis
15
!
!

Not
Louis
15
,
,
since
even
he
obeys
.

And
even
deeper
than
that
:
his
fear
lest
in
this
closed
hall
he
should
suddenly
itch
to
relieve
himself
.

We
heard
him
before
he
ever
showed
,
and
we
heard
him
yelling
after
he
was
out
of
sight
.

I
think
you
could
have
heard
him
a
mile
away
,
and
he
was
bursting
at
every
seam
with
importance
.

and
I
know
that
I
,
myself
,
was
nauseated
with
apprehension
and
fear
and
that
my
hands
were
soaking
wet
where
they
held
my
gun
.

I
wanted
to
wipe
my
flint
,
but
I
didn't
dare
to
,
the
state
my
hands
were
in
,
just
as
I
didn't
dare
to
do
anything
about
the
priming
.

and
in
that
brief
interval
,
a
redcoat
officer
came
tearing
down
the
road
,
whipping
his
horse
fit
to
kill
.

I
don't
know
whether
he
was
after
our
rider
,
who
had
gone
by
a
minute
before
,
or
whether
he
was
simply
scouting
conditions
;
;

He
was
a
fine
and
showy
rider
,
but
his
skill
was
wasted
on
us
.

The
redcoat
officer
collapsed
like
a
punctured
bolster
,
and
the
horse
reared
and
threw
him
from
the
saddle
,
except
that
one
booted
foot
caught
in
the
stirrup
.

but
this
grinning
,
broken
head
,
not
ten
feet
away
from
me
,
was
the
sharp
definition
of
what
my
reality
had
become
.

In
my
recollection
,
there
was
a
long
interval
between
the
death
of
the
officer
and
the
appearance
of
the
first
of
the
retreating
redcoats
,
and
in
that
interval
the
dust
cloud
over
the
road
seems
to
hover
indefinitely
.

In
the
very
front
rank
,
two
men
were
wounded
and
staggered
along
,
trailing
blood
behind
them
.

Rank
after
rank
of
them
came
down
the
road
,
and
the
faces
were
all
the
same
,
and
they
walked
in
a
sea
of
dust
.

One
moment
,
the
road
was
filled
with
disciplined
troops
,
marching
four
by
four
with
a
purpose
as
implacable
as
death
;
;

but
I
have
no
memory
of
that
.

and
about
a
mile
to
the
west
a
cluster
of
at
least
fifty
Militia
were
making
their
way
in
our
direction
.

Someone
said
that
while
we
were
standing
here
and
arguing
about
it
,
the
British
would
be
gone
;
;

but
Cousin
Simmons
said
he
had
watched
them
marching
west
early
in
the
morning
,
and
moving
at
a
much
brisker
pace
it
had
still
taken
half
an
hour
for
their
column
to
pass
,
what
with
the
narrowness
of
the
road
and
their
baggage
and
ammunition
carts
.

It
makes
sense
.

That
settled
it
,
and
we
broke
into
parties
of
two
and
three
.

The
slit
breeches
had
to
go
.

In
defiance
,
a
chinless
reprobate
,
Jake
Camaret
,
marched
down
the
aisle
in
St.
Peter's
one
Sunday
morning
,
followed
by
one
of
the
women
from
the
Bordel
,
whose
dress
and
walk
plainly
showed
the
lack
of
any
shame
.

Every
eye
was
on
him
as
he
began
to
speak
.

Philibert
Berthelier
,
the
son
of
the
famous
patriot
,
disagreed
.

There
can
be
no
compromise
when
souls
are
in
jeopardy
.

A
week
later
the
sentence
of
the
Council
was
carried
out
:
Jake
Camaret
and
the
woman
were
marched
naked
through
the
streets
past
a
mocking
populace
.

Charles
had
died
two
weeks
before
,
in
early
November
,
without
being
reconciled
to
the
Church
.

The
canons
,
in
a
body
,
had
tried
to
force
him
on
his
deathbed
to
let
them
give
him
the
last
rites
of
the
Church
,
but
he
had
died
still
proclaiming
salvation
by
faith
.

John
closed
his
eyes
and
saw
once
again
the
little
niche
in
his
mother's
bedroom
,
where
she
had
knelt
to
tell
the
good
Virgin
of
her
needs
.

Not
even
Varnessa
;
;

she
,
too
,
prayed
only
to
God
.

Underneath
the
big
one
,
in
the
silent
moonlight
,
lay
a
dead
pigeon
,
and
on
the
smaller
bell
,
the
Clemence
,
two
gray
and
white
birds
slept
huddled
together
in
the
cold
winter
air
.

above
him
the
deep
blue
sky
glittered
with
stars
.

How
long
,
my
Lord
?
?

Refugees
poured
in
,
signing
the
Confession
and
rules
in
order
to
remain
,
and
then
disregarding
them
.

We
will
have
righteousness
!
!

Tears
burned
behind
his
eyes
as
he
prayed
and
meditated
tonight
.

You
are
to
be
accused
of
Arianism
to
confuse
the
religious
who
remain
loyal
.

Ever
since
the
fourth
century
a
controversy
had
raged
over
the
person
of
Christ
.

Those
who
refused
to
believe
that
He
was
the
eternal
Son
of
God
were
termed
Arianists
.

Furthermore
,
Bern
decrees
that
we
must
do
as
we
are
ordered
by
the
Council
,
preach
only
the
word
of
God
and
stop
meddling
in
politics
!
!

It
was
always
the
spirit
with
Christ
;
;

Then
suddenly
a
group
of
men
and
dogs
circled
him
.

Heretic
!
!

John
lifted
his
hand
for
silence
.

Before
he
could
duck
,
another
stone
struck
him
.

Let
him
be
now
!
!

He
had
seen
a
dry
,
old
,
yellowing
hand
reach
out
,
with
that
painful
solicitude
,
to
touch
,
to
rearrange
,
to
shift
aimlessly
,
some
object
worth
a
pfennig
.

Back
in
Bavaria
he
had
seen
that
gesture
,
and
at
that
sight
his
heart
had
always
died
within
him
.

He
wondered
if
it
wore
the
old
anxiety
,
or
the
old
,
taut
stoicism
.

He
looked
out
of
the
tent
at
the
company
street
.

The
rain
dripped
on
the
freezing
loblolly
of
the
street
.

Adam
knew
the
names
of
some
.

It
was
Pullen
James
,
the
campmate
of
Simms
Purdew
.

Adam
stared
at
the
door
and
remembered
that
Simms
Purdew
had
been
awarded
the
Medal
of
Honor
for
gallantry
at
Antietam
.

The
street
was
again
empty
.

Into
the
emptiness
of
the
street
,
and
his
spirit
,
moved
a
form
.

The
figure
stopped
and
one
hand
was
perilously
freed
from
the
hamper
to
scratch
the
nose
.

This
was
one
of
the
Irish
women
who
had
built
their
own
huts
down
near
the
river
.

His
mind
closed
on
that
prospect
,
as
though
fog
had
descended
to
blot
out
a
valley
.

He
heard
the
words
:
Rock
of
Ages
,
cleft
for
me
,
Let
me
hide
myself
in
Thee
!
!

He
had
crossed
the
river
which
now
,
beyond
the
woods
yonder
,
was
sliding
darkly
under
the
mist
.

Those
men
,
lying
in
the
huts
,
they
did
not
know
.

Adam
rose
from
the
crouch
necessary
to
enter
the
hut
.

And
it
squealed
for
slop
.

Fooled
you
,
huh
?
?

It
is
sowbelly
with
tits
on
.

He
dumped
the
pan
of
crumbled
hardtack
into
the
boiling
pot
of
lobscouse
.

Know
what
I
had
to
fix
fer
Ole
Him
?
?

She
lost
not
a
second
,
picking
herself
up
and
continuing
her
pilgrimage
to
Laura
.

In
a
few
minutes
she
was
making
the
ten-foot
hike
unaided
;
;

The
comfort
was
short-lived
,
yet
she
found
herself
returning
to
the
assurance
whenever
her
imagination
forced
images
on
her
too
awful
to
contemplate
without
the
prop
of
illusion
.

Gazing
at
her
husband's
drugged
body
,
his
chest
rising
and
falling
in
mindless
rhythms
,
she
saw
the
grandeur
of
his
fictional
world
,
that
lush
garden
from
which
he
plucked
flowers
and
herbs
.

'nother
minute
I'd
have
been
fine
.

The
heat
intensified
on
Tuesday
.

He
and
Irvin
Moll
were
sipping
coffee
at
the
breakfast
bar
.

Both
had
been
up
since
7:00
--
Irv
on
the
early-morning
watch
,
McFeeley
unable
to
sleep
during
his
four-hour
relief
.

The
night
before
,
they
had
telephoned
the
Andrus
maid
,
Selena
Masters
,
and
she
had
arrived
early
,
bursting
her
vigorous
presence
into
the
silent
house
with
an
assurance
that
amused
McFeeley
and
confounded
Moll
.

The
latter
,
thanking
her
for
the
coffee
,
had
winked
and
muttered
,
Sure
'nuff
,
honey
.

She
was
the
only
kind
of
Negro
Laura
Andrus
would
want
around
:
independent
,
unservile
,
probably
charging
double
what
ordinary
maids
did
for
housework
--
and
doubly
efficient
.

McFeeley
greeted
the
parents
,
then
studied
his
notebook
.

A
couple
of
tips
we
are
running
down
--
nothing
promising
.

Before
that
,
he
wanted
to
talk
to
the
neighbors
.

When
the
detective
left
,
Andrus
phoned
his
secretary
to
cancel
his
work
and
to
advise
the
network
to
get
a
substitute
director
for
his
current
project
.

The
bulk
of
the
press
corps
was
covering
Rheinholdt's
conference
.

He
did
not
see
Sparling
,
or
DeGroot
,
or
Ringel
,
or
any
of
the
feverish
crew
that
had
so
harassed
him
twelve
hours
ago
.

When
McFeeley
was
halfway
to
the
door
,
the
proprietor
emerged
--
a
mountainous
,
dark
man
,
his
head
thick
with
resiny
black
hair
,
his
eyes
like
two
of
the
black
olives
he
imported
in
boatloads
.

Inside
,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Skopas
had
disclosed
--
in
a
hoarse
whisper
--
the
detective's
errand
,
his
family
gathered
in
a
huddle
,
forming
a
mass
of
dark
flesh
on
and
around
a
brocaded
sofa
which
stood
at
one
side
of
a
baroque
fireplace
.

Flanked
by
marble
urns
and
alabaster
lamps
,
they
seemed
to
be
posing
for
a
tribal
portrait
.

a
girl
in
her
twenties
,
fat
and
sullen
,
descending
the
marble
staircase
;
;

no
,
they
didn't
know
the
Andrus
family
;
;

Studying
them
,
McFeeley
could
not
help
make
comparison
with
the
Andrus
couple
.

He
imagined
they
were
the
kind
whose
tax
returns
were
never
examined
(
if
they
were
,
they
were
never
penalized
)
,
whose
children
had
no
unhappy
romances
,
whose
names
never
knew
scandal
.

Skopas
expressed
no
curiosity
over
the
case
,
offered
no
expression
of
sympathy
,
made
no
move
to
escort
McFeely
to
the
door
.

There
remained
a
family
named
Kahler
,
owners
of
a
two-story
Tudor-style
house
on
the
south
side
of
the
Andrus
home
.

each
shrub
glazed
with
good
health
.

The
door
was
answered
by
a
slender
man
in
his
sixties
--
straight-backed
,
somewhat
clerical
in
manner
,
wearing
rimless
glasses
.

When
Joe
identified
himself
,
he
nodded
,
unsmiling
,
and
ushered
him
into
a
sedate
living
room
.

Funny
thing
,
Mr.
Kahler
said
,
when
they
were
seated
,
when
I
heard
you
ringing
,
I
figured
it
was
that
guy
down
the
block
,
Hausman
.

Kahler
continued
:
I
fixed
his
dog
the
other
day
and
I
guess
he's
sore
,
so
I
expected
him
to
come
barging
in
.

Mr.
Kahler
went
on
to
explain
how
Hausman's
fox
terrier
had
been
making
in
his
flower
beds
.

The
dog
refused
to
be
scared
off
,
so
Kahler
had
purchased
some
small
firecrackers
.

He
would
lay
in
wait
in
the
garage
,
and
when
the
terrier
came
scratching
around
,
he'd
let
fly
with
a
cherry
bomb
.

I
hit
him
in
the
ass
once
.

Both
grinned
at
the
detective
.

She
was
intimidated
by
the
stove
.

He
didn't
,
but
it
was
not
really
a
question
,
and
so
he
left
the
room
,
walked
down
the
hall
to
the
front
of
the
apartment
,
hesitated
,
and
then
knocked
lightly
on
the
closed
door
of
the
study
.

Le
petit
dejeuner
,
Harold
said
,
in
an
accent
that
did
credit
to
Miss
Sloan
,
his
high-school
French
teacher
.

Eugene
put
a
spoonful
of
powdered
coffee
into
his
cup
and
then
filled
it
with
hot
water
.

They
assured
him
that
they
did
not
expect
or
need
to
be
entertained
.

Eugene
told
him
and
he
promptly
forgot
.

Nothing
was
said
about
hotels
or
train
journeys
.

Eugene
was
in
his
pajamas
and
dressing
gown
,
and
on
his
large
feet
he
wore
yellow
Turkish
slippers
that
turned
up
at
the
toes
.

Harold
shook
his
head
.

He
handed
Harold
a
key
to
the
front
door
,
and
cautioned
him
against
leaving
it
unlocked
while
they
were
out
of
the
apartment
.

A
young
woman
who
looked
like
Alix
,
with
her
two
children
.

Matching
photographs
in
oval
frames
of
Mme
Bonenfant
and
an
elderly
man
who
must
be
Alix's
grandfather
.

The
apex
,
the
study
where
Eugene
slept
,
was
light
and
bright
and
airy
and
cheerful
.

Da-da-da-dum
Music
could
not
be
Eugene's
passion
.

Besides
,
the
records
were
dusty
.

The
clock
on
the
mantel
piece
was
scandalized
and
ticked
so
loudly
that
he
glanced
at
it
over
his
shoulder
and
then
quickly
left
the
room
.

Oh
no
,
Harold
said
,
shocked
.

I
know
,
but
there
must
be
some
other
explanation
.

When
they
got
home
Harold
was
grateful
for
the
stillness
in
the
apartment
,
and
thought
how
,
under
different
circumstances
,
they
might
have
stayed
on
here
,
in
these
old-fashioned
,
high-ceilinged
rooms
that
reminded
him
of
the
Irelands'
apartment
in
the
East
Eighties
.

Barbara
asked
,
standing
in
the
doorway
.

There's
a
big
boat
anchored
near
the
Place
De
La
Concorde
,
with
a
swimming
pool
in
it
--
didn't
you
notice
it
?
?

But
if
he
has
time
to
go
swimming
,
he
had
time
to
be
with
us
.

I
don't
know
what
I
am
going
to
do
with
you
.

Then
what
was
it
?
?

I
don't
know
.

The
tweed
coat
,
maybe
.

And
in
any
case
,
answers
may
clarify
but
they
do
not
change
anything
.

Mostly
the
scene
was
crowded
with
mourners
,
such
as
the
dramatic
Dell'Arca
Lamentation
in
Bologna
,
where
the
grief-stricken
spectators
had
usurped
Mary's
last
poignant
moment
.

In
his
concept
there
could
be
no
one
else
present
.

Perhaps
after
the
soldiers
had
laid
him
on
the
ground
,
while
Joseph
of
Arimathea
was
at
Pontius
Pilate's
asking
for
Christ's
body
,
Nicodemus
was
gathering
his
mixture
of
myrrh
and
aloes
,
and
the
others
had
gone
home
to
mourn
.

There
would
be
no
halos
,
no
angels
.

In
his
sculpture
therefore
it
would
not
be
possible
for
him
to
project
anything
of
what
Jesus
felt
for
his
mother
;
;

Mary
would
have
to
carry
the
human
communication
.

The
colony
had
been
small
until
the
Spanish
Inquisition
of
1492
drove
many
Jews
into
Rome
.

The
men
did
not
object
to
his
sketching
them
while
they
went
about
their
work
,
but
no
one
could
be
persuaded
to
come
to
his
studio
to
pose
.

He
was
reading
from
the
Talmud
with
a
group
of
men
from
his
congregation
.

I
cannot
accomplish
this
if
you
will
not
help
me
.

I
am
working
for
the
Cardinal
of
San
Dionigi
.

His
first
model
arrived
at
dusk
.

He
worked
for
two
hours
a
day
with
each
model
sent
by
the
rabbi
.

He
spent
concentrated
weeks
putting
his
two
figures
together
:
a
Mary
who
would
be
young
and
sensitive
,
yet
strong
enough
to
hold
her
son
on
her
lap
;
;

Soon
he
was
ready
to
go
into
a
three-dimensional
figure
in
clay
.

the
wax
he
smoothed
over
to
give
the
body
surface
an
elastic
pull
.

Though
the
pain
was
considerable
Michelangelo
was
not
too
concerned
.

He
assumed
he
could
blink
the
splinter
out
.

But
it
would
not
come
.

Argiento
never
left
his
side
,
keeping
the
water
boiled
,
applying
hot
compresses
throughout
the
night
.

and
by
the
second
night
he
was
in
a
state
of
panic
:
he
could
see
nothing
out
of
the
afflicted
eye
.

The
surgeon
carried
a
cage
of
live
pigeons
.

The
surgeon
came
back
at
dusk
,
cut
the
vein
of
a
second
pigeon
,
again
washed
out
the
eye
.

He
sat
beside
Kate's
bed
with
the
others
throughout
the
morning
,
talking
,
talking
of
God's
will
,
while
Kate
lay
staring
angrily
at
him
.

In
blind
panic
of
grief
she
accepted
Jonathan's
dictum
,
and
believed
in
her
desperation
that
she
had
been
cursed
by
God
.

She
had
nothing
left
but
her
duty
to
his
land
and
his
son
.

Juanita
and
Mrs.
Tussle
kept
Kate
in
bed
a
week
until
her
milk
dried
.

When
she
returned
to
life
in
the
big
house
she
felt
shriveled
of
all
emotion
save
dedication
to
duty
.

Kate
felt
she
had
deserted
the
boy
in
her
own
loss
.

Not
this
old
fox
,
chuckled
Uncle
Randolph
.

Everybody
knows
I
am
just
a
harmless
,
deaf
old
man
who
takes
to
drink
.

I
aim
to
keep
a
little
whisky
still
back
in
the
ridge
for
my
pleasure
.

Hush
,
said
Uncle
Randolph
,
smiling
,
or
I'll
give
you
another
black
eye
.

Kate
drew
more
and
more
on
her
affection
for
Joel
through
the
hot
days
of
summer
work
.

He
had
the
hardest
pains
of
growing
before
him
now
,
as
he
approached
twelve
.

Dangling
his
gaudy
trinkets
before
them
,
he
told
of
the
Rebel
losses
in
the
mountains
,
at
Cheat
and
Rich
mountains
both
,
and
the
Federal
march
on
Beverly
.

Maj.
Anderson
of
Fort
Sumter
is
home
and
recruiting
volunteers
for
the
U.S.
Army
.

When
Kate
hurried
in
alarm
to
tell
him
to
put
it
out
,
she
saw
other
dots
of
flames
among
the
western
Virginia
hills
from
the
few
scattered
fires
of
the
faithful
.

They
all
prayed
now
that
the
North
would
realize
that
peace
must
come
,
for
Virginia
had
defended
her
land
victoriously
.

The
week
after
Manassas
the
sound
of
horses
in
the
yard
brought
Kate
up
in
shock
from
an
afternoon's
rest
when
she
saw
the
Federal
soldiers
from
her
upstairs
window
.

They
had
already
lost
most
of
their
corn
,
she
thought
.

As
Kate
came
swiftly
down
the
stairs
to
the
hall
she
saw
Colonel
Marsh
framed
in
the
doorway
,
his
face
set
in
the
same
vulnerable
look
Juanita
wore
.

I
stopped
to
say
goodbye
,
Mrs.
Lattimer
,
and
to
tell
you
how
sorry
I
was
to
hear
about
your
baby
.

When
are
you
to
leave
?
?

Would
you
permit
Juanita
to
walk
about
the
grounds
with
me
for
a
short
spell
,
Mrs.
Lattimer
?
?

She
sought
Kate
out
upstairs
,
her
lips
trembling
.

The
things
left
unsaid
they
both
felt
deeply
,
and
with
a
sigh
they
fell
back
on
the
well-stuffed
pillows
.

In
the
ballroom
below
,
the
dark
had
given
way
to
moonlight
coming
in
through
the
bank
of
French
windows
.

I
am
getting
deaf
,
I
must
admit
it
.

Where
is
everyone
?
?

Peter
,
you
lummox
,
you've
forgot
to
order
the
musicians
.

There
were
times
now
,
like
this
,
when
she
lost
control
of
the
time
count
and
moved
freely
back
and
forth
into
three
generations
.

When
Peter
had
reached
his
majority
at
eighteen
?
?

And
this
handsome
booby
,
staring
and
sweating
,
was
he
her
bridegroom
?
?

David
Cortlandt
was
tired
beyond
almost
the
limits
of
his
flesh
.

Now
,
driving
the
horse
and
sulky
borrowed
from
Mynheer
Schuyler
,
he
felt
as
if
every
bone
was
topped
by
burning
oil
and
that
every
muscle
was
ready
to
dissolve
into
jelly
and
leave
his
big
body
helpless
and
unable
to
move
.

It
had
the
features
of
a
man
bewhiskered
by
clumps
of
loose
feathers
.

Black
strips
of
skin
hung
from
it
.

New
York
lay
bleaching
in
the
summer
sun
,
and
the
morning
fish
hawk
,
flying
in
the
heated
air
,
saw
below
him
the
long
triangular
wedge
of
Manhattan
Island
.

On
the
western
tip
of
Long
Island
protruded
Brooklyn
Heights
.

These
were
the
ships
of
His
Majesty's
Navy
,
herding
the
hulks
of
the
East
Indies
merchants
and
the
yachts
and
ketches
of
the
loyalists
.

The
news
of
battle
on
Breed's
Hill
had
already
seeped
through
,
and
New
York
itself
was
now
left
in
the
hands
of
the
local
Provincial
Congress
.

The
captain's
gig
of
H.M.S.
Mercury
was
being
rowed
to
H.M.S.
Neptune
.

Across
the
bay
the
Palisades
were
heavy
in
green
timber
;
;

their
rock
paths
led
down
to
the
Hudson
.

a
carriage
raising
up
the
choking
June
dust
,
and
beyond
,
in
a
meadow
,
a
local
militia
company
drilling
with
muskets
,
Kentuck'
rifles
,
every
kind
of
horse
pistol
,
old
sword
,
or
cutlass
.

The
wraith-like
events
of
the
last
few
days
flooded
David's
mind
and
he
rubbed
his
unshaved
chin
and
felt
again
the
ache
in
his
kidneys
caused
by
his
saddle
odyssey
from
Boston
.

Pensive
,
introspective
,
he
ached
.

He
scratched
his
mosquito-plagued
neck
.

He
found
tepid
water
in
a
pitcher
and
a
last
bit
of
soap
,
and
he
lathered
his
face
and
stood
stropping
the
razor
on
his
broad
leather
belt
,
its
buckle
held
firm
by
a
knob
of
the
bedpost
.

But
it
did
not
matter
.

He
stropped
the
razor
slowly
;
;

One
had
to
believe
in
final
events
or
one
was
stranded
in
the
abyss
of
nothing
.

He
saw
with
John
Hunter
now
that
the
perfectability
of
man
was
a
dream
.

Life
was
a
short
play
of
tenebrous
shadows
.

David
began
to
shave
with
great
sweeping
strokes
.

David
finished
shaving
,
washed
his
face
clean
of
lather
,
and
combed
and
retied
his
hair
.

He
had
sat
beside
Alexander
Brandel
at
the
rostrum
of
a
congress
of
Zionists
.

All
of
them
were
there
in
this
loosely
knit
association
of
diversified
ideologies
,
and
each
berated
the
other
and
beat
his
breast
for
his
own
approaches
.

I
do
not
care
if
your
beliefs
take
you
along
a
path
of
religion
or
a
path
of
labor
or
a
path
of
activism
.

This
is
our
singular
goal
.

Where
we
end
our
journey
is
always
the
same
.

In
his
heart
he
had
no
desire
to
go
to
Palestine
.

And
now
Andrei
sat
on
a
train
on
the
way
to
Lublin
and
wondered
if
he
was
not
being
punished
for
his
lack
of
belief
.

He
saw
the
smug
eyes
of
the
Home
Army
chief
,
Roman
,
and
all
the
Romans
and
the
faces
of
the
peasants
who
held
only
hatred
for
him
.

Only
Palestine
,
and
I
will
never
live
to
see
Palestine
because
I
did
not
believe
.

By
late
afternoon
the
train
inched
into
the
marshaling
yards
in
the
railhead
at
Lublin
,
which
was
filled
with
lines
of
cars
poised
to
pour
the
tools
of
war
to
the
Russian
front
.

At
a
siding
,
another
train
which
was
a
familiar
sight
these
days
.

He
walked
toward
the
center
of
the
city
to
keep
his
rendezvous
with
Styka
.

The
Bathyrans
were
all
gone
.

As
the
messages
from
Himmler
,
Heydrich
,
and
Eichmann
came
in
through
Alfred
Funk
,
Lublin's
fountainhead
spouted
.

A
bevy
of
interlacing
lagers
,
work
camps
,
concentration
camps
erupted
in
the
area
.

In
the
spring
of
1942
Operation
Reinhard
began
in
Lublin
.

The
ghetto
,
a
miniature
of
Warsaw's
,
was
emptied
into
the
camp
in
the
Majdan-Tartarski
suburb
called
Majdanek
.

Was
Operation
Reinhard
the
same
pattern
for
the
daily
trains
now
leaving
the
Umschlagplatz
in
Warsaw
?
?

Andrei
stopped
at
Litowski
Place
and
looked
around
quickly
at
the
boundary
of
civil
buildings
.

He
almost
broke
into
tears
.

For
a
time
I
thought
of
trying
to
reach
the
Free
Polish
Forces
,
but
one
thing
led
to
another
.

I
got
a
girl
in
trouble
and
we
had
to
get
married
.

Many
times
I
tried
to
reach
you
,
but
I
never
knew
how
.

Were
you
able
to
make
the
arrangements
?
?

I
don't
know
.

I
have
to
believe
it
.

Styka
shook
his
head
slowly
.

But
we
are
neither
blind
nor
insane
.

Grabski's
shanty
was
beyond
the
bridge
over
the
River
Bystrzyca
near
the
rail
center
.

Grabski
sat
in
a
sweat-saturated
undershirt
,
cursing
the
excessive
heat
which
clamped
an
uneasy
stillness
before
sundown
.

He
was
a
square
brick
of
a
man
with
a
moon-round
face
and
sunken
Polish
features
.

He
grunted
a
sort
of
yes
answer
.

It
will
take
a
few
days
.

We
get
strange
orders
.

Well
--
what
about
the
money
?
?

Andrei
peeled
off
five
one-thousand-zloty
notes
.

You
get
the
rest
when
I
am
safely
out
of
Majdanek
.

She
was
getting
real
dramatic
.

When
I'd
delivered
myself
of
that
gem
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
order
up
another
drink
.

It
was
the
call
of
the
wild
all
right
.

It
was
the
same
old
routine
.

Precious
and
I
allow
each
other
absolute
freedom
.

That
really
would
be
funny
.

Never
in
my
life
have
I
felt
so
remorseful
about
anything
I've
done
as
I
did
about
spending
that
night
with
my
own
wife
.

Eileen
declared
she
couldn't
lift
her
head
from
the
pillow
.

Instead
of
wanting
to
sock
the
poor
bastard
I
found
myself
having
a
fellowfeeling
for
him
.

I
couldn't
face
Thelma
after
that
night
.

All
she
did
was
write
me
a
pleasant
little
note
about
how
it
was
beautiful
while
it
lasted
but
that
now
life
had
parted
our
ways
and
it
was
goodbye
forever
.

She
added
a
postscript
begging
me
to
be
careful
about
drinking
.

Trust
Eileen
to
squeeze
all
the
drama
out
of
a
situation
.

To
be
on
the
safe
side
I
never
let
Eileen
get
out
of
my
sight
day
or
night
.

Precious
had
me
worried
.

I
never
could
find
out
what
his
business
was
.

Connections
was
all
he
would
say
with
that
smooth
hurt
smile
when
I
put
leading
questions
.

Poor
devil
he
can't
have
been
too
happy
either
.

She
just
wouldn't
listen
.

Getting
drunk
every
night
was
the
only
way
I
could
handle
the
situation
.

The
trouble
was
drinking
cost
money
.

Whom
God
hath
joined
etcetera
.

Now
it
would
be
up
to
me
to
keep
the
little
girl
out
of
mischief
.

It
just
about
blew
us
both
out
of
the
water
when
Eileen
suddenly
came
out
with
what
she
came
out
with
.

Greatest
thing
that
ever
happened
.

He'd
come
East
for
the
christening
,
by
God
he
would
.

A
friend
of
Pat's
named
Frank
Sposato
had
just
muscled
into
the
Portwatchers'
Union
.

It
was
responsible
and
sometimes
dangerous
work
because
the
thieving
is
awful
in
the
port
of
New
York
.

It
was
only
natural
that
Fletcher
would
strive
for
a
position
in
which
he
could
make
the
decisions
.

Even
Rector
himself
was
prey
to
this
spirit
of
competition
and
he
knew
it
,
not
for
a
more
exalted
office
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
church
--
his
ambitions
for
the
bishopry
had
died
very
early
in
his
career
--
but
for
the
one
clear
victory
he
had
talked
about
to
the
colonel
.

Rector
had
never
been
able
to
find
out
much
about
Hino's
past
.

Putting
the
pieces
of
this
mosaic
together
,
Rector
had
the
vague
outlines
of
a
biography
.

If
and
when
Hino
decided
to
tell
him
about
his
experiences
,
he
would
do
so
unasked
.

The
oyabun
was
entertaining
a
group
of
dignitaries
,
the
secretary
said
,
businessmen
from
Tokyo
for
the
most
part
,
and
Kayabashi
wished
to
show
them
the
mission
.

At
the
same
time
,
it
was
unlikely
that
any
businessmen
would
spend
a
day
in
a
Christian
mission
out
of
mere
curiosity
.

Rector
asked
him
to
move
it
for
the
time
being
;
;

I
would
like
to
enact
a
little
tableau
this
afternoon
,
Rector
said
,
He
explained
about
the
visit
and
the
effect
he
wished
to
create
,
the
picture
of
a
very
busy
mission
.

Fletcher
nodded
as
he
listened
to
the
instructions
and
said
he
would
arrange
the
things
Rector
requested
.

How
many
children
do
you
have
present
today
?
?

I
would
like
them
to
appear
very
busy
today
,
not
busy
exactly
,
but
joyous
,
exuberant
,
full
of
life
.

I'll
try
.

The
altercation
in
the
coffee
house
had
done
little
to
dampen
his
spirits
,
but
he
was
still
a
little
wary
around
Rector
for
they
had
not
yet
discussed
the
incident
.

No
,
sir
,
Johnson
said
.

You
are
about
to
become
a
first-class
surveyor
,
Rector
said
.

The
glass
is
out
of
it
,
but
that
won't
matter
.

It
looks
pretty
efficient
and
that's
the
important
thing
.

He
went
on
to
explain
what
he
had
in
mind
.

He
said
he
could
do
it
.

He
was
not
going
to
lose
the
mission
by
default
,
and
whatever
reason
Kayabashi
had
for
bringing
his
little
sight-seeing
group
to
the
mission
,
he
was
going
to
be
in
for
a
surprise
.

The
air
was
cooler
here
,
and
the
lacy
pattern
of
the
trees
threw
a
dappled
shadow
on
the
grass
,
an
effect
which
he
found
pleasant
.

She
concluded
by
asking
him
to
name
another
hour
should
this
one
be
inconvenient
.

She
was
told
by
the
manservant
who
opened
the
door
that
his
lordship
was
engaged
on
work
from
which
he
had
left
strict
orders
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
.

On
Thursday
evening
we
may
go
out
of
town
together
by
some
stage
or
mail
about
the
distance
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
.

we
can
return
the
following
morning

Victory
at
last
!
!

There
have
been
cooing
doves
,
chattering
magpies
,
thieving
jackdaws
,
a
proud
peacock
,
a
silly
goose
,
and
a
harpy
eagle
--
whom
I
was
silly
enough
to
mate
with
and
who
is
now
busy
tearing
at
my
vitals
.

He
regaled
Claire
with
an
account
of
the
mock
mass
performed
by
the
cassocked
bloods
,
which
he
had
had
at
firsthand
from
old
Bud
Dodington
,
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
so-called
Order
.

The
jaded
amorist
conjured
up
pictures
of
the
blasphemous
rites
with
relish
.

Alas
,
all
that
belonged
to
the
age
of
Devil
Dashwood
and
Wicked
Wilkes
,
abbot
and
beadsman
of
the
Order
!
!

Charming
and
peaceful
--
but
what
were
charm
and
peace
compared
to
high
adventure
?
?

Alone
with
the
fabulous
Byron
!
!

To
be
passive
,
to
be
girlishly
shy
was
palpably
absurd
.

The
fire
in
the
sitting
room
was
lighted
.

A
cold
supper
was
ordered
and
a
bottle
of
port
.

Sex
is
overpriced
,
he
said
.

Wasn't
the
owl
her
symbol
?
?

then
,
to
better
purpose
,
he
took
hold
of
the
knot
and
with
dextrous
fingers
,
untied
it
.

Pausing
in
the
doorway
he
said
:
The
form
of
the
human
female
,
unlike
her
mind
and
her
spirit
,
is
the
most
challenging
loveliness
in
all
nature
.

The
hero
of
his
next
poem
is
Napoleon
Bonaparte
,
said
Claire
,
with
slightly
overdone
carelessness
.

I
mustn't
tell
,
I
mustn't
tell
,
she
repeated
to
herself
.

Alastor
was
published
only
to
be
savagely
attacked
,
contemptuously
ignored
.

Not
a
thought
nor
a
cadence
was
missed
in
her
summary
of
appreciation
.

You
have
made
the
labor
worth
while
,
he
said
to
her
,
smiling
.

I
am
sure
he
is
in
raptures
.

There
are
other
Mr.
Thynnes
.

She
was
resentful
of
his
easy
success
as
compared
with
Shelley's
failure
.

The
lordly
poet
was
at
low-water
mark
.

The
careless
writing
was
in
keeping
with
his
mood
of
savage
discontent
.

On
all
sides
doors
were
being
slammed
in
his
face
.

For
the
moment
there
was
no
woman
in
his
life
,
and
it
was
this
vacuum
that
had
given
Claire
her
opportunity
.

He
refused
to
bring
Claire
to
it
even
as
an
occasional
visitor
,
claiming
that
his
every
move
was
watched
by
spies
of
the
Milbankes
.

Beckworth
handed
the
pass
to
the
colonel
.

He
would
remain
in
the
tent
,
waiting
impatiently
,
occupied
by
some
trivial
task
.

--
The
last
six
months
,
sir
?
?

It's
got
to
stop
.

I
want
to
take
a
look
.

This
is
no
damned
holiday
,
Beckworth
.

The
colonel
crouched
tensely
on
one
of
the
folding
chairs
,
methodically
tearing
at
his
thumbnail
.

At
least
the
Union
officer
had
been
decent
enough
to
provide
a
candle
.

There
was
no
place
to
sit
,
but
Watson
walked
slowly
from
the
ladder
to
the
window
slits
and
back
,
stooping
slightly
to
avoid
striking
his
head
on
the
heavy
beams
.

In
the
corner
was
the
soldier
with
the
white
flag
.

Watson
hardly
looked
at
him
.

Watson
had
presented
his
pouch
and
been
led
to
the
bombproof
.

He
had
hoped
to
be
alone
in
the
bombproof
,
but
the
soldier
had
followed
him
.

Watson
glanced
briefly
at
him
,
seeing
only
a
body
rigidly
erect
behind
the
languid
banner
.

If
my
pass
is
approved
,
I
may
be
a
half
hour
.

He
paced
slowly
,
stooping
,
staring
at
the
damp
,
slippery
floor
.

His
lack
of
success
steadily
eroded
his
interest
.

What
in
the
name
of
God
was
he
doing
,
crouched
in
a
timbered
pit
on
the
wrong
bank
of
the
river
?
?

What
did
he
hope
to
accomplish
here
?
?

A
soldier
held
the
end
of
a
frayed
rope
.

Three
Union
guards
appeared
,
carrying
their
rifles
at
ready
.

The
crawling
men
tried
to
rise
and
fell
again
.

No
one
moved
to
them
.

In
a
confused
,
soaked
and
stumbling
shift
of
bodies
and
lifting
arms
,
the
two
men
were
dragged
into
the
same
skiff
.

The
third
crawling
man
forced
himself
erect
.

His
steps
were
short
and
stiff
,
and
,
with
his
head
thrown
back
,
his
progress
was
a
supercilious
strut
.

He
had
reached
the
three
passive
guards
;
;

The
figure
on
the
earth
halted
,
seemingly
bewildered
.

If
only
there
was
a
clock
for
him
to
crawl
against
.

Watson
raced
for
him
,
his
boots
slamming
the
soft
earth
.

One
man
dropped
to
his
knee
for
better
aim
.

Watson
pounded
to
the
crawling
man
and
stopped
,
panting
heavily
.

But
you
ain't
Henry
.

Is
it
far
?
?

Can
you
walk
?
?

I
can
walk
real
good
.

--
Oh
,
Christ
.

He
promised
to
take
me
.

The
man
swayed
on
a
thwart
,
turning
his
ruined
eyes
from
side
to
side
.

Watson
snatched
a
deep
breath
.

He
stood
with
his
back
to
the
skiff
.

The
men
mewed
and
scratched
,
begging
to
be
taken
away
.

Men
were
slaughtered
every
day
,
tumbled
into
eternity
like
so
many
torn
parcels
flung
down
a
portable
chute
.

What
right
had
John
to
any
special
consideration
?
?

To
hell
with
John
.

Watson
spat
on
the
ground
.

I
can
see
it
from
this
window
where
I
write
.

Offer
her
a
cup
of
tea
and
she
would
say
,
Why
,
these
cups
look
just
like
a
set
I
gave
to
the
Salvation
Army
last
year
.

Twenty
years
ago
,
she
would
have
been
known
as
a
golf
widow
,
and
the
sum
of
her
manner
was
perhaps
one
of
bereavement
.

She
usually
wore
weeds
,
and
a
stranger
watching
her
board
a
train
might
have
guessed
that
Mr.
Pastern
was
dead
,
but
Mr.
Pastern
was
far
from
dead
.

He
was
marching
up
and
down
the
locker
room
of
the
Grassy
Brae
Golf
Club
shouting
,
Bomb
Cuba
!
!

Charity
as
she
knew
it
was
complex
and
reciprocal
,
and
almost
every
roof
she
saw
signified
charity
.

Mrs.
Horowitz
was
in
charge
of
diseases
of
the
nose
and
throat
.

Mrs.
Trempler
was
tuberculosis
,
Mrs.
Surcliffe
was
Mothers'
March
of
Dimes
,
Mrs.
Craven
was
cancer
,
and
Mrs.
Gilkson
did
the
kidney
.

it
was
her
life
.

The
contributions
were
ahead
of
what
she
had
got
the
previous
year
,
and
while
the
money
,
of
course
,
was
not
hers
,
it
excited
her
to
stuff
her
kit
with
big
checks
.

She
stopped
at
the
Surcliffes'
after
dusk
,
and
had
a
Scotch-and-soda
.

I
got
a
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
for
the
hepatitis
fund
,
she
said
excitedly
when
he
walked
in
.

The
name
encouraged
him
,
because
he
always
felt
that
he
could
handle
the
Irish
.

There
was
a
glass
pane
in
the
front
door
,
and
through
this
he
could
see
into
a
hallway
where
a
plump
woman
with
red
hair
was
arranging
flowers
.

A
fire
had
just
been
lighted
,
he
saw
,
and
things
had
been
set
out
for
drinks
,
and
,
like
any
stray
,
his
response
to
these
comforts
was
instantaneous
.

At
the
end
of
the
room
there
was
a
desk
heaped
with
papers
,
and
she
began
to
riffle
these
,
making
sighs
and
and
noises
of
girlish
exasperation
.

I'll
have
a
drink
,
then
,
if
you'll
have
one
with
me
.

If
you
will
promise
to
make
it
weak
.

The
only
way
to
find
things
is
to
relax
.

She
didn't
like
to
travel
.

I've
seen
you
walking
your
dogs
on
Sunday
and
driving
by
in
the
convertible
.

The
thought
of
this
lonely
woman
sitting
at
her
window
touched
him
,
although
he
was
even
more
touched
by
her
plumpness
.

And
knowing
its
humble
place
in
the
scale
of
things
,
why
did
he
,
at
this
time
of
life
,
seem
almost
ready
to
sell
his
soul
for
plumpness
?
?

He
didn't
doubt
her
truthfulness
,
although
he
had
heard
the
words
a
hundred
times
.

I've
never
done
this
before
,
they
always
said
,
pouring
another
whiskey
.

I've
never
done
this
before
,
they
always
said
,
putting
on
their
stockings
.

It's
after
eleven
.

Bomb
them
!
!

Throw
a
little
nuclear
hardware
at
them
!
!

His
worries
harried
him
up
out
of
bed
,
and
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
went
to
the
window
.

It
was
not
as
though
she
noted
clearly
that
her
nephews
had
not
been
to
see
her
for
ten
years
,
not
since
their
last
journey
eastward
to
witness
their
Uncle
Izaak
being
lowered
into
the
rocky
soil
;
;

She
grasped
the
chair
arms
and
brought
her
thin
body
upright
,
like
a
bird
alert
for
flight
.

There
she
extracted
two
limp
vellum
sheets
and
wrote
off
the
letters
,
one
to
Abel
,
one
to
Mark
.

And
the
stiffly
regal
look
of
them
,
she
saw
grimly
,
lacked
the
quaver
of
age
which
,
thwarting
the
efforts
of
her
amazing
will
,
ran
through
her
spoken
words
like
a
thin
ragged
string
.

To
Abel
:
I
am
afraid
there
is
not
much
to
amuse
small
children
here
.

You
may
stay
as
long
as
you
wish
,
of
course
,
but
if
arranging
for
the
care
of
the
girls
must
take
time
into
account
,
I
think
a
day
or
two
should
be
enough
to
finish
our
business
in
.

She
signed
the
letters
quickly
,
stamped
them
,
and
placed
them
on
the
hall
table
for
Raphael
to
mail
in
town
.

My
nephews
will
be
coming
down
,
she
said
that
evening
as
Angelina
brought
her
dinner
into
the
dining
room
,
the
whole
meal
on
a
vast
linen-covered
tray
.

Angelina
stepped
back
,
her
eyes
roaming
the
tray
for
omissions
.

Yes
,
she
said
,
I
remember
that
they
came
here
every
summer
.

Jessica
Packard
lifted
her
head
and
followed
the
retreating
figure
,
her
eyes
resting
nearly
closed
on
the
unself-conscious
rise
and
fall
of
the
rounded
hips
.

then
she
snorted
and
groped
for
her
fork
.

There's
no
greater
catastrophe
in
the
universe
,
she
reflected
dourly
,
impaling
tender
green
beans
on
the
silver
fork
,
than
the
dwindling
away
of
a
family
.

Procreation
,
expansion
,
proliferation
--
these
are
the
laws
of
living
things
,
with
the
penalty
for
not
obeying
them
the
ultimate
in
punishments
:
oblivion
.

When
the
fate
of
the
individual
is
visited
on
the
group
,
then
(
the
warm
sweet
butter
dripped
from
her
raised
trembling
fork
and
she
pushed
her
head
forward
belligerently
)
,
ah
,
then
the
true
bitterness
of
existence
could
be
tasted
.

Each
successive
movement
in
his
growing
was
recorded
on
the
unreeling
film
inside
her
.

In
the
cruel
clearness
of
her
memory
the
boy
remained
unchanged
,
quick
with
the
delight
of
laughter
,
and
the
pain
with
which
she
recalled
that
short
destroyed
childhood
was
still
unendurable
to
her
.

It
was
one
with
the
desolate
rocks
and
the
alien
water
on
those
days
when
she
hated
the
sea
.

He
saw
the
land
with
a
stranger's
eyes
,
all
the
old
familiarness
gone
.

And
it
presented
itself
to
him
as
it
would
to
any
stranger
,
impervious
,
complete
in
itself
.

What
bad
grace
,
what
incredible
selfishness
he
and
Mark
had
shown
.

They
had
closed
over
,
absolutely
,
with
the
sealing
of
old
Izaak's
grave
.

The
old
woman
,
stubbornly
reigning
in
the
house
above
the
crashing
waters
took
on
an
ominous
reality
.

Mark
held
the
wheel
loosely
,
but
his
fingers
curved
around
it
in
a
purposeful
way
and
the
deliberate
set
of
his
body
spoke
plainly
of
the
figure
he'd
make
in
the
years
to
come
.

His
sandy
hair
was
already
beginning
to
thin
and
recede
at
the
sides
,
and
Abel
looked
quickly
away
.

The
vacation
traffic
was
becoming
heavier
as
they
approached
the
sea
.

He
gave
Abel
a
quick
glance
and
moved
closer
to
the
wheel
,
hugging
it
to
him
,
and
Abel
caught
this
briefest
of
allusions
to
guilt
.

I
imagine
the
old
girl
hasn't
missed
us
much
,
Mark
added
,
his
eyes
on
the
road
.

There
was
the
smell
of
the
coast
,
like
a
primeval
memory
,
composed
of
equal
parts
salt
water
,
clams
,
seaweed
and
northern
air
.

He
turned
from
the
flying
trees
to
look
ahead
and
saw
with
an
inward
boy's
eye
again
the
great
fieldstone
house
which
,
built
on
one
of
the
many
acres
of
ancestral
land
bordering
the
west
harbor
,
had
been
Izaak's
bride-gift
to
his
cousin-wife
as
the
last
century
ended
.

Mark's
thoughts
must
have
been
keeping
silent
pace
beside
his
own
,
climbing
the
same
crags
in
dirty
white
sneakers
,
clambering
out
on
top
of
the
headland
and
coming
upon
the
sudden
glinting
water
at
the
same
instant
.

There
was
the
day
Uncle
Izaak
had
,
in
an
unexpected
grandiose
gesture
,
handed
over
the
pretty
sloop
to
Abel
for
keeps
,
on
condition
that
he
never
fail
to
let
his
brother
accompany
him
whenever
younger
the
boy
wished
.

They
came
unexpectedly
upon
the
sea
.

Mark
stopped
the
car
and
switched
off
the
lights
and
they
sat
looking
at
the
water
,
which
,
there
being
no
moon
out
,
at
first
could
be
distinguished
from
the
sky
only
by
an
absence
of
stars
.

Oh
he'd
not
care
about
the
Pedersen
kid
.

I
didn't
hurry
though
it
was
cold
and
the
Pedersen
kid
was
in
the
kitchen
.

I
shook
him
a
little
harder
and
made
some
noise
.

Oh
he
was
smart
.

Pa
was
on
his
side
,
looking
at
me
,
his
eyes
winking
,
the
hand
that
had
hit
me
a
fist
in
the
pillow
.

A
fat
hell
on
Big
Hans
.

He
found
the
Pedersen
kid
by
the
crib
.

Pa
had
his
head
up
,
glaring
,
his
teeth
gnawing
at
the
place
where
he'd
grown
a
mustache
once
.

You
know
I
don't
want
to
see
Pedersen
.

He's
an
even
bigger
fool
than
you
are
.

He
was
about
to
get
up
so
I
got
out
,
slamming
the
door
.

He
was
rubbing
snow
on
the
kid's
legs
and
feet
.

Water
from
the
snow
and
water
from
the
towels
had
run
off
the
kid
to
the
table
where
the
dough
was
,
and
the
dough
was
turning
pasty
,
sticking
to
the
kid's
back
and
behind
.

What
about
your
pa
?
?

What'd
he
say
?
?

Did
you
get
the
whisky
?
?

Did
you
ask
him
about
the
whisky
?
?

Well
he
don't
.

He
don't
care
at
all
,
and
I
don't
care
to
get
my
head
busted
neither
.

He
don't
care
about
anybody
.

Hans
shook
his
head
but
neither
of
us
tried
to
stop
her
.

If
we
had
,
then
one
of
us
would
have
had
to
go
instead
.

I'll
get
more
snow
,
I
said
.

I
thought
she'd
gone
upstairs
and
expected
to
hear
she
had
.

It
wasn't
like
getting
cheated
at
the
fair
.

She'd
found
one
and
she
hadn't
said
a
word
while
Big
Hans
and
I
had
hunted
and
hunted
as
we
always
did
all
winter
,
every
winter
since
the
spring
that
Hans
had
come
and
I
had
looked
in
the
privy
and
found
the
first
one
.

Sometimes
he
didn't
seem
to
because
he
hid
them
so
well
he
couldn't
find
them
himself
or
because
he
looked
and
didn't
find
anything
and
figured
he
hadn't
hid
one
after
all
or
had
drunk
it
up
.

He
didn't
figure
her
at
all
,
and
if
he
found
out
a
woman
it'd
be
bad
.

You
going
to
put
more
towels
on
him
?
?

Colors
on
the
towels
had
run
.

What
are
we
going
to
do
with
these
?
?

I
got
hold
his
mouth
open
.

O.K.
,
I
am
lifting
.

His
head
flopped
back
.

His
mouth
is
open
.

His
throat's
shut
.

I
put
my
arm
carefully
around
him
.

Just
hold
him
like
I
told
you
.

I
had
my
arm
behind
his
back
.

His
files
,
desk
,
drafting
board
and
a
high
stool
formed
the
only
clean
island
in
the
chaos
.

Everywhere
else
his
ideas
lay
or
hung
in
visible
form
:
his
models
,
drawings
,
ten-foot
canvases
in
monochromes
from
his
painting
days
,
and
underfoot
a
windfall
of
broken-backed
books
that
looked
as
though
their
insides
had
been
ransacked
by
a
maniac
.

He
worked
standing
,
with
his
left
hand
in
his
pocket
as
though
he
were
merely
stopping
for
a
moment
,
sketching
with
the
surprised
stare
of
one
who
was
watching
another
person's
hand
.

Sometimes
he
would
grunt
softly
to
some
invisible
onlooker
beside
him
,
sometimes
he
would
look
stern
and
moralistic
as
his
pencil
did
what
he
disapproved
.

he
had
found
his
style
quite
early
in
his
career
and
he
thought
it
quite
wonderful
that
the
world
admired
it
,
and
he
could
not
imagine
why
he
should
alter
it
.

He
would
wear
this
same
costume
in
Florida
,
despite
his
wife
Cleota's
reminders
over
the
past
five
days
that
he
must
take
some
cool
clothes
with
him
.

He
saw
the
surprise
in
her
face
,
and
laughed
as
though
it
were
the
funniest
expression
he
had
ever
seen
.

And
she
was
made
to
fall
in
love
with
him
again
there
in
the
rutted
dirt
driveway
standing
in
the
cold
fog
,
mad
as
she
was
at
his
going
away
when
he
really
didn't
have
to
,
mad
at
their
both
having
got
older
in
a
life
that
seemed
to
have
taken
no
more
than
a
week
to
go
by
.

Now
she
could
let
out
the
three
parakeets
without
fear
they
would
be
stepped
on
or
that
Stowey
would
let
them
out
one
of
the
doors
;
;

She
fell
asleep
leaning
on
her
hand
,
hearing
the
house
creaking
as
though
it
were
a
living
a
private
life
of
its
own
these
two
hundred
years
,
hearing
the
birds
rustling
in
their
cages
and
the
occasional
whirring
of
wings
as
one
of
them
landed
on
the
table
and
walked
across
the
newspaper
to
perch
in
the
crook
of
her
arm
.

She
stood
up
,
smoothing
her
hair
down
,
straightening
her
clothes
,
feeling
a
thankfulness
for
the
enveloping
darkness
outside
,
and
,
above
everything
else
,
for
the
absence
of
the
need
to
answer
,
to
respond
,
to
be
aware
even
of
Stowey
coming
in
or
going
out
,
and
yet
,
now
that
she
was
beginning
to
cook
,
she
glimpsed
a
future
without
him
,
a
future
alone
like
this
,
and
the
pain
made
her
head
writhe
,
and
in
a
moment
she
found
it
hard
to
wait
for
Lucretia
to
come
with
her
guests
.

She
stood
still
over
the
leg
of
lamb
,
rubbing
herbs
into
it
,
quite
suddenly
conscious
of
a
nausea
in
her
stomach
and
a
feeling
of
wrath
,
a
sensation
of
violence
that
started
her
shivering
.

Enjoy
being
a
bride
while
you
can
.

And
there
was
still
not
anything
that
Linda
Kay
could
do
.

She
had
made
curtains
for
all
the
windows
of
her
little
house
,
and
she
had
kept
it
spotless
and
neat
,
shabby
as
it
was
,
and
cooked
good
meals
for
Bobby
Joe
.

She
had
done
all
the
things
she
had
promised
herself
she
would
do
,
but
she
had
not
thought
of
this
.

When
they
first
married
he
had
been
working
in
the
fields
all
day
,
and
she
would
get
in
the
car
and
drive
to
wherever
he
was
working
,
to
take
him
a
fresh
hot
meal
.

There
was
no
reason
for
her
to
ask
what
they
did
.

When
Linda
Kay
had
put
up
her
breakfast
dishes
and
mopped
her
linoleum
rugs
,
she
would
go
to
the
Big
House
.

The
older
men
would
be
there
at
noon
,
and
maybe
rest
for
a
time
before
they
took
their
guns
off
to
the
creek
or
drove
down
the
road
towards
town
.

They
had
cleaned
up
an
old
ice
box
and
begun
to
buy
fifty-pound
blocks
of
ice
in
town
,
as
the
electric
refrigerator
came
nowhere
near
providing
enough
ice
for
the
crowds
who
ate
and
drank
there
.

It
was
a
Cadillac
,
black
grayed
with
the
dust
of
the
road
,
its
windows
closed
tight
so
you
knew
that
the
people
who
climbed
out
of
it
would
be
cool
and
unwrinkled
.

They
were
an
old
fat
couple
(
as
Linda
Kay
described
them
to
herself
)
,
a
thick
middle-aged
man
,
and
a
girl
about
ten
or
twelve
.

We
were
on
our
vacation
in
Canada
,
Howard
explained
,
in
a
muffled
voice
that
must
have
been
used
to
booming
,
and
the
news
didn't
catch
up
with
us
till
we
were
nearly
home
.

She
felt
the
look
and
looked
back
because
she
could
not
help
it
,
seeing
that
he
was
neither
as
old
nor
as
thick
as
she
had
at
first
believed
.

He
asked
,
when
she
passed
him
a
glass
.

Oh
yes
,
Mama
laughed
.

This
joke
was
not
funny
to
Linda
Kay
,
and
she
blushed
,
as
she
always
did
;
;

then
,
hearing
the
muffled
boom
of
Howard's
laughter
,
blushed
redder
.

He's
just
a
big
windbag
.

When
he
was
a
kid
I
wasn't
around
.

Bobby
Joe
took
a
gun
from
behind
the
door
,
and
with
a
quick
Bye
now
was
gone
for
the
day
.

In
her
sophomore
year
she
had
started
going
steady
with
Bobby
Joe
,
who
was
a
football
player
,
Future
Homemakers
sweetheart
,
and
president
of
Future
Farmers
.

It
made
her
feel
different
about
Howard
.

Bobby
Joe
was
trying
to
get
Linda
Kay
to
say
she
would
cook
one
if
he
brought
it
home
.

Linda
Kay
felt
like
going
off
to
the
bedroom
to
cry
;
;

After
they
had
left
,
some
of
the
people
moved
around
,
to
find
more
comfortable
places
to
sit
.

Perhaps
it
was
just
that
he
had
so
much
more
flesh
,
so
that
more
of
it
seemed
to
come
in
contact
with
hers
;
;

But
tell
me
,
doctor
,
where
do
you
plan
to
conduct
the
hatching
?
?

He
placed
it
on
Alex's
lap
.

That
first
entry
there
is
the
Vermont
Flumenophobe
,
the
earliest
and
one
of
the
most
successful
of
my
eighty-three
varieties
--
great
big
scapulars
and
hardly
any
primaries
at
all
.

The
doctor
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
professional
interests
have
found
scope
,
drew
Alex's
attention
to
those
excellences
which
might
otherwise
have
escaped
him
:
the
fine
color
in
comb
and
wattles
,
the
length
and
quality
of
neck
and
saddle
hackles
,
the
firm
,
wide
spread
of
the
toes
,
and
a
rare
justness
in
the
formation
of
the
ear
lappets
.

It
was
then
that
they
heard
the
tread
of
one
descending
and
,
in
some
perturbation
glancing
up
,
saw
the
patronne
coming
towards
them
as
they
gained
the
landing
.

Vous
voulez
vos
petits
dejeuners
tout
de
suite
alors
?
?

Ejaculated
the
surprised
woman
,
looking
at
Alex
for
an
explanation
but
he
,
parting
from
her
without
ceremony
,
only
offered
a
few
words
about
the
doctor's
provincial
American
speech
and
a
state
of
nerves
brought
on
by
the
demands
of
his
work
.

The
doctor
instantly
asked
.

The
doctor
sat
down
rather
wearily
,
caressing
the
hen
and
remarking
that
the
city
was
not
the
place
for
a
poultry-loving
man
,
but
no
sooner
was
the
remark
out
than
a
knock
at
this
door
obliged
him
to
cover
the
hen
with
his
greatcoat
once
more
.

It
was
evident
that
a
second
transfer
had
to
be
effected
,
and
that
it
had
to
take
place
between
the
time
the
fille
finished
the
doctor's
room
and
the
time
she
began
Alex's
.

unwarranted
they
were
in
any
case
for
,
as
he
stood
facing
the
fille
de
chambre
,
his
ears
were
assailed
by
new
sounds
from
the
interior
of
the
shower
room
.

Without
comment
he
opened
the
closet
and
from
its
shelves
constructed
a
highboard
around
the
egg
case
which
he
had
placed
on
the
floor
inside
.

Next
,
the
hen
was
nested
and
all
seemed
well
.

Alex
returned
to
the
hotel
,
rather
weary
and
with
no
new
prospects
of
a
role
,
in
the
late
afternoon
,
but
found
the
doctor
in
an
ebullient
mood
.

Well
,
he
began
,
It
seems
like
some
people
in
Paris
want
to
hear
more
from
me
than
those
fellers
over
at
the
conference
house
do
.

Going
downstairs
with
the
tray
,
Winston
wished
he
could
have
given
in
to
Miss
Ada
,
but
he
knew
better
than
to
do
what
she
said
when
she
had
that
little-girl
look
.

The
enormous
plates
which
had
held
Mr.
Jack's
four
fried
eggs
and
five
strips
of
bacon
were
still
stacked
in
the
sink
.

Winston
stacked
Miss
Ada's
thin
pink
dishes
in
the
sink
.

Winston
watched
her
fumbling
to
untie
her
apron
.

Carefully
,
he
undid
the
bow
.

I
told
you
what
Miss
Ada's
doctor
said
.

Four
years
!
!

He
doubted
whether
she
heard
him
,
over
the
running
water
.

He
sat
for
a
while
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
watching
the
bend
of
her
back
as
she
gathered
up
her
things
--
a
comb
,
a
bottle
of
aspirin
--
to
take
upstairs
and
pack
.

She
was
too
young
,
that
was
all
;
;

Mr.
Jack
cried
when
the
brush
tipped
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
.

Winston
apologized
and
quickly
set
the
hat
right
.

He
noticed
a
speck
of
dirt
on
the
sill
and
swiped
at
it
with
his
finger
.

For
the
first
time
,
he
be
sad
about
the
move
.

Ten
years
ago
,
he
had
come
to
the
house
to
be
interviewed
.

Since
then
,
the
flowers
she
had
planted
had
spread
all
over
the
hill
.

And
the
dogwood
in
early
May
,
for
Miss
Ada's
alfresco
party
;
;

In
the
living
room
,
Miss
Ada
was
standing
by
the
window
with
a
sheaf
of
lists
in
her
hand
.

He
brought
it
in
and
put
it
down
beside
her
.

sometimes
when
he
was
pressing
,
Winston
raised
her
dresses
to
his
face
.

Frowning
,
Miss
Ada
studied
the
list
.

The
alabaster
cockatoo
.

Neither
of
them
trusted
the
movers
.

He
picked
up
the
photograph
and
began
to
wrap
it
.

Well
,
that's
over
now
.

Leave
that
fool
picture
out
,
she
added
sharply
.

Mr.
Jack
sets
store
by
that
.

Really
,
Winston
.

He
had
only
agreed
with
Miss
Ada
about
getting
the
valet
,
but
he
had
actually
suggested
the
photograph
to
Mr.
Jack
.

You
know
what
she
likes
,
Winston
,
he
had
said
wearily
,
one
evening
in
November
when
Winston
was
pulling
off
his
overshoes
.

Lovie
,
you
make
me
feel
naked
.

I
guess
it's
children
make
a
woman
old
.

I'll
give
you
a
medical
certificate
,
framed
,
if
you
like
,
Miss
Ada
had
said
.

After
that
they
had
sat
for
five
minutes
without
saying
a
word
.

These
letters
became
the
center
of
my
existence
.

My
memory
has
catalogued
for
easy
reference
and
withdrawal
the
image
of
her
pink
,
scented
stationery
and
the
unsloped
,
almost
printed
configurations
of
her
neat
,
studious
handwriting
with
which
she
invited
me
to
recall
our
summer
,
so
many
sentences
beginning
with
Remember
when
;
;

As
it
turned
out
,
Jessica
took
matters
into
her
own
hands
.

Having
received
permission
to
give
a
camp
reunion-Halloween
party
,
she
asked
that
I
come
and
be
her
date
.

We
blushed
and
were
flustered
,
and
it
turned
out
to
be
the
fleetest
brush
of
lips
upon
cheek
.

It
was
at
that
party
that
,
finally
overcoming
my
timidity
,
inspired
by
tales
only
half-understood
and
overheard
among
older
boys
,
I
asked
Jessie
to
spend
New
Year's
Eve
with
me
.

Among
my
school
and
neighborhood
friends
,
during
the
next
months
,
I
bragged
and
swaggered
and
pompously
described
my
impending
date
.

But
though
I
boasted
and
gave
off
a
dapper
front
,
I
was
beneath
it
all
frightened
.

All
this
was
unknown
to
me
,
and
yet
I
had
dared
to
ask
her
out
for
the
most
important
night
of
the
year
!
!

Her
optimism
gave
me
heart
.

I
set
the
hour
of
our
meeting
for
seven
.

Was
I
supposed
to
buy
a
funny
hat
and
a
rattle
for
Jessica
?
?

I
looked
for
Jessica
to
materialize
out
of
the
clogging
,
curdling
crowd
and
,
as
the
time
passed
and
I
waited
,
a
fiend
came
to
life
beside
me
and
whispered
in
my
ear
:
How
was
I
planning
to
greet
Jessica
?
?

Where
exactly
would
we
go
after
the
movie
?
?

Suppose
I
hadn't
brought
along
enough
money
?
?

I
felt
for
my
wallet
.

At
7:25
two
hotel
doormen
came
thumping
down
the
steps
,
carrying
a
saw-horse
to
be
set
up
as
a
barricade
in
front
of
the
haberdashery
store
window
next
to
the
entranceway
,
and
as
I
watched
them
in
their
gaudy
red
coats
that
nearly
scraped
the
ground
,
their
golden
,
fringed
epaulets
and
spic
,
red-visored
caps
,
I
suddenly
saw
just
over
their
shoulders
Jessica
gracefully
making
her
way
through
the
crowd
.

You
must
have
loved
that
girl
very
much
,
but
you
couldn't
have
meant
it
when
you
said
that
you
wanted
to
kill
her
.

You
are
not
the
kind
to
go
violent
.

Would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
I
were
,
Mary
Jane
?
?

You
what
,
Mary
Jane
?
?

We
keep
getting
the
same
ones
back
again
and
again
.

I
wanted
to
go
to
college
,
too
--

You
don't
seem
to
know
much
about
reality
.

What
about
your
father
and
mother
,
don't
you
think
of
them
when
you
are
in
a
place
like
this
?
?

Aunt
Mary
died
when
I
was
doing
my
military
service
.

I
have
no
one
but
myself
to
worry
about
.

We've
always
been
so
close
.

When
she
had
finished
I
said
:

Your
dad
sounds
like
a
good
father
and
a
good
policeman
.

There
are
things
about
me
that
I
can't
tell
you
now
,
Mary
Jane
,
I
said
,
but
if
you'll
go
out
to
dinner
with
me
when
I
get
out
of
Hanover
,
I'd
like
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
.

As
for
that
other
girl
,
let's
just
say
that
I
never
want
to
see
her
again
.

It
seemed
the
most
important
thing
in
my
life
at
this
moment
that
she
should
know
the
real
truth
about
me
.

Such
optimism
was
completely
unjustified
.

I
closed
the
last
bag
and
stood
all
three
at
the
door
for
the
bellboy
to
pick
up
,
then
went
to
the
bathroom
for
a
drink
of
water
.

I
am
calling
you
,
Mr.
Nelson
,
at
the
request
of
Mr.
Phillip
Wycoff
.

All
right
,
you
bastards
,
I
said
,
the
great
actor
is
about
to
buy
a
drink
.

The
Oldsmobile
with
the
license
number
JYJ
114
was
in
stall
number
five
.

Okay
,
I
said
to
the
attendant
,
I'll
let
you
know
if
I
close
the
deal
on
the
office
in
this
building
.

He
gave
me
a
ticket
on
the
agency
car
and
parked
it
.

You
are
the
one
I
was
talking
to
about
a
monthly
rental
.

I
went
back
to
the
agency
car
and
got
out
an
electric
bug
,
one
of
the
newest
devices
for
electronic
shadowing
.

I
always
keep
a
set
in
the
car
.

I
put
in
new
batteries
so
as
to
be
certain
I'd
have
plenty
of
power
and
on
my
way
out
walked
over
to
the
regular
parking
stalls
and
stood
looking
at
them
thoughtfully
.

Your
leg
muscles
and
back
muscles
feel
weary
.

You
are
conscious
of
the
fact
that
your
feet
hurt
,
that
the
city
pavements
are
hard
.

I
waited
a
solid
two
hours
before
my
man
came
out
of
the
office
building
.

I'll
have
one
of
the
boys
get
it
,
he
said
.

I
stayed
half
a
block
behind
him
,
letting
lots
of
cars
keep
in
between
us
,
listening
to
the
steady
beep
beep
beep
.

I
turned
left
too
soon
and
got
a
signal
showing
that
I
was
still
behind
him
but
he
was
to
the
right
.

Then
he
came
out
and
started
driving
toward
the
beach
.

My
lights
would
have
been
a
giveaway
if
I'd
tried
to
shadow
him
in
the
conventional
manner
.

His
signal
was
coming
loud
and
clear
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
turned
to
a
buzz
.

I
sat
where
I
could
watch
the
exit
and
realized
I
was
hungry
.

My
man
came
out
an
hour
later
,
drove
to
the
beach
,
turned
right
and
after
half
a
mile
went
to
the
Swim
and
Tan
Motel
.

Any
difference
in
the
rate
?
?

I
took
another
sidelong
glance
at
the
other
registration
card
,
then
took
the
key
to
Unit
13
that
she
had
given
me
and
went
down
long
enough
to
park
the
car
.

She
knew
where
to
come
.

It's
one
thing
to
go
without
food
when
you
are
occupied
with
some
work
or
when
you
are
simply
postponing
a
meal
,
but
when
you
are
dependent
on
someone
else
and
know
that
you
can't
eat
until
he's
bedded
down
for
the
night
,
hunger
can
be
a
gnawing
torture
.

I
got
in
the
car
,
drove
down
to
the
drive-in
and
ordered
a
couple
of
hamburgers
with
everything
included
,
a
cup
of
coffee
and
the
fastest
service
possible
.

She
gave
a
little
pout
and
said
,
I
don't
get
off
work
until
eleven
o'clock
.

What's
that
thing
going
buzz-buzz-buzz
in
your
car
?
?

No
,
I
said
.

Diets
can
be
terrible
,
the
girl
said
.

Good
figures
should
be
kept
in
hand
,
she
said
,
and
walked
away
with
an
exaggerated
wiggle
.

I
turned
on
the
device
again
,
half
fearful
that
I
might
find
silence
,
but
the
buzzes
came
in
loud
and
clear
.

--
so
even
if
we
was
as
dumb
as
you
take
us
for
,
we
could
still
find
it
.

He
was
going
to
be
sensible
and
not
try
to
do
anything
rash
with
that
gun
pointed
at
him
.

There
was
something
phony
about
all
this
gun
waving
--
something
not
quite
what
it
seemed
in
the
detailed
directions
for
finding
the
police
.

In
a
flash
she
was
away
to
the
back
,
paying
no
attention
to
three
angry
shouts
from
the
male
throats
.

Slowly
she
turned
to
face
the
men
again
.

You
ain't
kidding
me
--
the
kid
don't
know
the
name
of
this
town
?
?

With
a
curse
,
Vince
seized
the
thing
nearest
,
a
glass
sugar
container
with
a
spouted
metal
top
,
and
threw
it
against
the
wall
opposite
.

sugar
sprayed
with
a
hiss
that
was
loud
in
the
silence
.

His
mouth
worked
over
the
profanity
,
the
obscenities
in
his
vocabulary
.

After
Guardino's
left
,
we'll
dump
the
kid
somewhere
near
the
border
where
she
kin
get
home
.

I
wish
you
luck
when
you
try
scaring
that
kid
.

Lauren
Landis
rubbed
her
face
against
the
blanket
.

Although
she
found
she
was
thirsty
,
she
was
about
to
refuse
(
never
,
never
take
candy
from
a
strange
man
)
when
she
saw
the
bottle
was
unopened
.

The
man
was
busy
doing
something
to
the
inside
of
the
door-frame
on
the
driver's
side
of
a
car
.

She
said
,
Barney
,
why
is
he
keeping
me
here
?
?

She
dropped
her
head
on
her
arms
on
the
counter
.

This
is
the
end
of
the
line
.

Roberta
was
violently
trembling
.

Why
don't
we
drive
around
the
corner
?
?

As
he
chewed
his
gum
and
exuded
wheezing
breath
,
Marty
smelt
the
reek
of
bad
whiskey
.

He
did
not
answer
.

I
wonder
if
one
of
you
gentlemen
could
drive
me
back
to
town
?
?

The
seventeen
men
stood
and
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
longer
.

They
piled
into
the
waiting
cars
,
motors
roared
,
the
cars
sped
off
.

Marty
Land
stood
alone
on
a
red-clay
road
as
storm
clouds
gathered
ominously
in
the
sky
again
.

From
a
great
distance
thunder
growled
and
broke
the
silence
.

He
thought
he
saw
a
pale
face
at
a
window
.

There
was
another
on
this
side
,
a
little
further
down
.

There
were
many
more
between
here
and
Jarrodsville
.

As
he
approached
the
first
farmhouse
,
thunder
sounded
behind
him
again
,
closer
now
and
louder
,
like
a
steadily
advancing
drum
corps
.

Perhaps
they
had
a
car
or
truck
and
would
drive
him
into
town
.

It
concerned
an
officer
who
had
been
disgraced
and
drummed
out
.

The
steady
roll
of
the
drums
had
sounded
behind
him
as
he
walked
between
the
endless
ranks
of
the
men
he
had
commanded
,
and
each
man
about-faced
and
turned
his
back
as
the
officer
approached
.

The
day's
rain
had
been
added
to
the
stagnant
water
.

He
was
trapped
on
the
road
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
an
approaching
car
.

Marty's
heart
skipped
a
beat
when
he
recognized
it
.

The
station
wagon
came
to
a
stop
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
in
front
of
him
,
beside
a
fenced
field
.

It
was
the
Ford
that
had
been
outside
Burch's
farm
.

It
was
a
narrow
road
,
barely
wide
enough
for
two
cars
to
pass
.

He
could
not
leave
the
road
because
of
the
water-filled
drainage
ditch
.

The
cars
,
with
their
load
of
howling
men
,
had
disappeared
in
the
distance
.

He
still
had
three
miles
to
go
.

At
least
he
could
climb
up
on
the
fence
when
his
tormenters
roared
by
again
.

There
was
even
a
bare
chance
that
the
phone
had
not
been
disconnected
.

He
splashed
on
,
mud
sucking
at
his
feet
with
each
step
,
until
he
reached
the
end
of
the
drainage
ditch
and
the
beginning
of
the
fence
that
enclosed
the
farm
.

He
lost
all
sense
of
dignity
.

You
could
not
stand
on
dignity
when
you
were
soaked
and
muddied
and
your
life
was
at
stake
.

And
now
he
saw
them
.

They
were
coming
on
at
reckless
speed
for
such
old
vehicles
.

When
the
Plymouth
neared
,
it
veered
toward
him
and
seemed
about
to
run
him
down
.

The
weird
,
insane
sound
of
the
Rebel
yell
reverberated
again
and
echoed
from
the
distant
hills
.

He
was
nearing
the
Admassy
house
.

And
then
he
heard
a
car
coming
from
the
east
,
and
he
felt
as
if
he
would
break
down
and
weep
.

Get
in
,
Charley
Estes
said
brusquely
.

I
couldn't
fight
a
dozen
or
so
of
'em
.

This
is
redneck
country
.

Have
you
got
my
car
here
?
?

It's
parked
in
front
.

Shayne
drove
westward
from
the
Boulevard
slowly
,
letting
Rourke
crane
his
head
out
the
window
and
watch
for
street
numbers
.

It
was
back
there
.

I
didn't
notice
it
.

It
has
a
Beach
license
,
Tim
.

Two
men
in
the
front
seat
.

You
are
a
reporter
,
and
you
are
looking
for
Miss
Perrin
to
interview
her
.

He
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
bar
enjoying
a
slug
of
cognac
when
Rourke
came
in
six
or
eight
minutes
later
.

Shayne
told
the
bartender
,
Bourbon
and
water
,
and
Rourke
told
him
,
It's
those
two
,
all
right
.

Shayne
said
happily
,
I've
got
it
all
worked
out
,
Tim
.

The
bartender
brought
Rourke's
drink
and
Shayne
laid
a
twenty-dollar
bill
on
the
bar
.

You
know
how
it
is
,
he
added
with
a
conspiratorial
wink
.

As
the
detective
slid
it
into
his
pocket
,
Rourke
asked
sadly
,
What
in
hell
are
you
going
to
do
,
Mike
?
?

Three
minutes
,
Tim
.

He
walked
over
to
the
right-hand
door
,
opened
it
and
got
the
reloaded
automatic
out
of
the
glove
compartment
and
put
it
in
his
hip
pocket
.

Shayne
turned
the
handle
and
jerked
the
door
open
before
either
of
the
men
were
quite
aware
of
his
presence
in
the
night
.

Shayne
stepped
back
to
let
him
slump
to
the
ground
,
and
then
dived
over
him
through
the
open
door
into
Harris
who
was
cursing
loudly
and
trying
to
drag
a
gun
from
a
shoulder
holster
,
somewhat
impeded
by
the
steering
wheel
.

They
went
up
onto
a
front
porch
and
into
a
small
hallway
where
a
dim
bulb
burned
high
in
the
ceiling
.

There
were
two
front
rooms
,
both
dark
behind
their
transoms
,
and
there
was
no
sound
or
light
in
the
entire
house
to
indicate
that
any
of
the
occupants
were
awake
.

Eight
,
nine
steps
above
him
,
Roberts
had
paused
.

He
glanced
up
in
time
to
see
Roberts
hurtling
down
on
him
from
above
,
literally
flying
through
the
air
,
his
bloody
face
twisted
.

Mickey
tried
to
flatten
against
the
banister
,
gripped
it
with
one
hand
,
but
Roberts'
full
weight
struck
him
at
that
moment
in
the
groin
.

He
gasped
for
air
and
the
impact
tore
his
hand
from
the
rail
.

He
felt
his
empty
pocket
and
knew
that
Roberts
had
retrieved
the
only
weapon
at
hand
.

The
knifelike
pain
in
his
groin
nearly
brought
him
down
again
.

The
pain
dulled
as
he
moved
,
and
he
steadied
inside
.

It
moved
in
a
silver
arc
toward
his
throat
,
then
veered
downward
.

Ducking
,
Mickey
tripped
and
fell
to
one
side
,
landing
heavily
on
the
wood
floor
.

He
felt
it
rip
at
the
side
of
his
jacket
and
a
momentary
sting
under
his
left
ribs
.

He
hit
Roberts
with
his
left
fist
in
the
ribs
and
the
razor
cut
toward
him
feebly
,
then
wobbled
in
mid-air
.

if
not
yet
,
then
soon
,
very
soon
.

Suddenly
it
was
cold
in
the
lobby
.

He
looked
at
where
Roberts
lay
sprawled
on
the
step
.

One
thing
,
he
thought
,
nobody
knows
about
it
yet
.

Roberts
was
a
wastrel
.

Walking
away
on
impulse
,
he
might
logically
leave
behind
what
it
was
inconvenient
to
carry
.

He
set
Roberts'
suitcase
near
the
front
door
,
went
outside
and
walked
back
to
the
garage
.

He
could
feel
it
on
his
face
and
in
his
hair
.

He
took
the
suitcase
out
to
the
Jeep
and
put
it
in
the
front
seat
.

Then
he
went
back
for
Roberts
.

The
soft
snow
was
deceitful
underfoot
.

Twice
he
nearly
fell
.

Inside
the
passage
,
he
had
to
work
his
way
over
the
fallen
timber
and
nearly
collapsed
under
his
clumsy
burden
.

He
stood
looking
down
for
a
few
seconds
,
then
backed
up
two
or
three
paces
from
the
edge
.

There
was
too
much
weight
casually
to
toss
it
away
.

It
was
a
bad
place
for
Roberts
to
wind
up
,
but
Roberts
had
asked
for
it
.

It
hung
momentarily
on
the
point
of
dropping
off
.

He
got
to
his
feet
and
threw
the
flashlight
beam
into
the
pit
.

The
body
lay
in
an
awkward
sprawl
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
below
the
level
of
the
tunnel
floor
.

Deep
enough
,
he
decided
.

He
made
his
way
back
to
the
Jeep
.

He
had
started
to
back
into
the
turn
when
he
remembered
the
razor
in
his
pocket
.

There
were
stains
here
and
there
and
he
cleaned
them
off
,
using
an
oiled
rag
he
found
on
a
nail
.

He
wiped
the
steering
wheel
and
all
the
places
he
might
have
touched
the
Jeep
.

He
replaced
the
flashlight
where
it
had
been
stowed
,
got
into
his
own
car
and
backed
it
out
of
the
garage
.

Liz
Peabody
,
he
thought
,
might
spend
some
time
grieving
for
her
lost
lover
,
but
he
doubted
that
she
would
launch
an
investigation
.

I
am
not
exactly
jumping
up
and
down
with
enthusiasm
.

Seated
in
front
of
the
desk
,
Hank
said
,
I
am
looking
for
some
information
with
very
little
to
go
on
,
Sheriff
.

He
explained
the
background
of
the
case
,
ending
with
the
tenuous
clue
which
had
brought
him
to
Gulf
Springs
.

It'll
be
a
tedious
job
,
but
if
you
want
to
try
it
,
the
old
newspaper
files
are
in
the
basement
here
in
the
county
supervisor's
office
.

She'd
also
remember
if
the
groom
died
later
.

It
turned
out
that
she
also
sold
real
estate
,
cosmetics
,
and
hospital
insurance
.

I
remember
her
because
she
didn't
want
her
picture
in
the
paper
.

Was
her
name
Lisa
Carmody
?
?

Now
how
in
hell
would
I
remember
that
?
?

I
think
they
moved
away
shortly
after
they
were
married
.

He
hurried
across
to
the
courthouse
and
caught
the
sheriff
just
as
he
was
leaving
.

Sounds
like
what
you
are
after
,
he
said
when
Hank
had
finished
.

Wants
to
look
up
something
in
the
newspaper
files
,
so
don't
lock
him
in
here
.

Now
don't
shut
this
door
.

It
won't
open
from
inside
.

They
were
a
sight
more
comfortable
than
the
ones
in
the
jail
with
the
cold
air
from
Hirey's
air
conditioner
coming
through
the
grille
.

They
are
all
here
,
back
to
1865
,
Carruthers
told
him
.

And
,
of
course
,
you
know
not
to
take
clippings
.

I'll
leave
the
air
conditioner
on
for
you
,
Mr.
Ferrell
,
said
Hirey
.

Don't
forget
to
turn
it
off
and
close
the
door
good
so
it'll
latch
.

Hank
thanked
them
and
promised
to
observe
the
rules
.

In
a
tour
around
the
stacks
,
he
found
that
the
earliest
volumes
began
on
the
left
and
progressed
clockwise
around
the
room
.

Near
it
was
a
metal
ladder
on
casters
attached
to
the
top
shelf
.

At
last
he
found
it
in
the
paper
of
April
2
.

Hank
was
beginning
to
feel
sharp
concern
for
Mr.
Black
.

He
glanced
at
his
watch
,
saw
it
was
only
seven
,
and
decided
to
indulge
his
weakness
now
.

He
jumped
up
and
turned
around
to
see
the
metal
door
closing
.

Who's
there
?
?

Then
he
heard
the
outer
door
closing
.

Hey
,
come
back
,
he
shouted
.

Whoever
it
was
had
meant
to
shut
him
up
in
here
,
had
followed
him
and
waited
till
the
courthouse
and
square
were
deserted
.

Nobody
could
hear
what
was
going
on
in
this
underground
vault
.

They
kept
drifting
apart
and
merging
again
in
his
mind
like
some
minute
form
of
life
on
a
microscope
slide
.

Time
,
said
Angie
,
and
he
smiled
very
sweet
and
slow
at
Mr.
Skyros
.

Angie
knew
--
Speak
of
dangerous
information
!
!

Really
he
had
Mr.
Skyros
at
bay

Big
favor
I
done
you
.

And
can't
say
I
blame
you
,
said
Angie
thoughtfully
.

This
deal
with
the
ace
o'
spades
.

Angelo
gave
him
an
affectionate
smile
.

Now
you
don't
want
to
go
talking
that
way
,
he
said
.

Sure
,
sure
,
you
are
the
one
take
over
for
Pretty
,
soon
as
I
get
the
supply
,
get
started
up
again
,
isn't
it
?
?

I
tell
you
,
I
know
how
it
is
with
you
,
my
friend
,
I
sympathize
,
and
I'll
make
it
a
special
point
--
a
special
favor
--
get
in
touch
,
and
get
some
stuff
just
for
you
.

I
don't
know
if
I
can
manage
it
tonight
or
tomorrow
,
but
I'll
try
my
best
,
my
friend
.

I
bring
you
the
cash
,
say
five
hundred
for
ten
decks
.

Never
mind
how
much
I
cut
it
,
how
much
I
get
,
and
he
smiled
his
sleepy
smile
again
.

I
do
my
best
,
said
Mr.
Skyros
earnestly
,
just
for
you
,
my
friend
.

Not
very
much
later
,
but
when
things
had
settled
down
a
little
.

The
kind
who
came
into
a
cheap
store
like
this
!
!

Grab
,
snatch
,
I
saw
that
first
!
!

Not
when
she'd
waited
so
long
already
.

No
need
say
anything
at
all
to
the
old
woman
.

She
had
it
all
planned
out
,
how
she'd
do
.

No
need
leave
a
note
with
it
,
either
--
or
maybe
just
something
like
,
Don't
worry
about
me
,
I
am
going
away
to
make
a
better
life
.

You've
give
me
the
wrong
change
,
said
the
customer
sharply
.

Think
I
can't
count
?
?

Katya
made
up
the
amount
in
indifferent
silence
.

She
was
listening
to
other
voices
,
out
of
the
future
.

Oh
,
Katharine's
awfully
nice
,
and
pretty
too
,
I
like
Katharine
--
Let's
ask
Katharine
to
go
with
us
,
she's
always
lots
of
fun
--
Katharine
--

Soon
,
very
soon
now

He
seemed
to
remember
reading
somewhere
that
Abyssinians
had
large
litters
,
and
suffered
a
dismaying
vision
of
the
apartment
overrun
with
a
dozen
kittens
.

A
lot
of
people
are
so
peculiar
that
they
don't
like
cats
,
it's
not
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
find
good
homes
for
kittens
--
and
,
damn
it
,
you
know
very
well
if
I
have
them
around
long
,
impossible
to
give
them
away
!
!

Yes
,
well
,
it's
a
pity
to
spoil
your
girlish
figure
--
which
all
those
kittens
would
do
anyway
--
but
I
think
when
you've
raised
these
we'll
just
have
the
vet
fix
it
so
there
won't
be
any
more
.

I
wonder
if
the
Carters
would
take
one
.

Maude's
long
nose
unexpectedly
wrinkled
up
.

Happened
to
be
in
the
hall
!
!

She
lost
her
beau
to
you
.

Drink
your
coffee
--

Maude
suddenly
looked
quite
capable
of
pouring
it
down
her
throat
.

What
can
they
do
if
they
find
them
?
?

She
felt
cold
and
hot
,
sticky
and
chilly
at
the
same
time
.

He
didn't
even
know
that
she
was
there
.

Sarah
had
begun
to
tell
Lucien
of
Emile
,
she
had
begun
to
question
and
a
little
draft
had
crept
across
the
room
from
the
bedroom
door
,
open
barely
enough
to
show
a
rim
of
blackness
in
the
hall
.

Rev
had
known
all
along
.

Rev
didn't
need
to
break
the
wax
seal
,
read
the
contract
and
find
out
.

She
ate
what
she
could
and
went
out
along
the
covered
passageway
,
with
the
rain
dripping
from
the
vines
.

It
was
a
long
,
low
room
,
like
a
root
cellar
,
for
it
was
banked
up
with
soil
,
and
vines
had
run
rampant
over
that
,
too
.

She
started
back
for
the
house
,
saw
a
light
in
the
office
,
opened
the
door
and
surprised
a
domestic
little
scene
which
was
far
outside
the
dark
realm
of
murder
or
attempted
murder
.

Rev
,
George
and
Lolotte
were
mending
shoes
.

With
boots
on
,
Lolotte
laughed
softly
.

Rev
looked
up
and
saw
her
.

Rev
said
,
Come
in
,
Sarah
.

Reckon
you
know
the
news
.

Now
why
did
I
do
that
?
?

As
she
reached
the
kitchen
door
the
answer
presented
itself
;
;

So
she
couldn't
choose
Rev
as
a
confidant
;
;

She
paused
at
the
kitchen
door
,
caught
her
breath
,
told
herself
firmly
that
the
opium
was
only
an
attempt
to
frighten
her
and
went
into
the
kitchen
,
where
Glendora
was
eyeing
the
chickens
dismally
and
Maude
was
cleaning
lamp
chimneys
.

Glendora
gave
a
gulp
.

Again
the
homely
,
everyday
details
of
daily
living
refuted
a
vicious
attempt
to
frighten
her
--
or
to
murder
her
.

Try
talking
to
some
of
the
fellows
he
works
with
,
friends
,
anyone
.

I
think
so
.

I
just
don't
want
to
go
off
half-cocked
before
picking
up
Black
,
that's
all
.

Gilborn
says
he
was
in
his
office
all
day
with
her
yesterday
.

Thirty
years'
experience
let
him
know
,
even
at
this
early
stage
,
that
Black
was
his
man
.

It
was
a
cold
,
windy
day
,
the
day
after
Kitti's
death
,
but
Stanley
Gilborn
paid
no
attention
to
the
blustery
October
wind
.

Emotionally
,
they
penetrated
him
not
at
all
.

Gilborn
passed
by
him
without
seeing
him
.

Without
taking
off
his
coat
,
he
sat
in
the
blue
chair
which
still
faced
the
closed
bedroom
door
.

She
was
all
he
had
,
everything
he
had
,
everything
he
wanted
.

Quickly
,
he
went
into
the
bedroom
.

The
bed
was
empty
now
.

He
would
lie
in
it
no
more
.

He
could
think
of
no
answer
.

Before
leaving
,
he
took
one
last
,
lingering
look
at
the
apartment
.

For
Blanche
,
Kitti's
death
was
a
source
of
guilty
,
but
nonetheless
soaring
,
happy
hope
.

Men
,
she
reflected
,
even
men
like
Stanley
,
are
unpredictable
.

She
had
invited
him
in
for
coffee
.

Without
warning
,
without
giving
her
a
chance
to
prepare
for
it
.

Later
,
she
apologized
for
the
long
scratch
across
his
face
,
tried
to
explain
she
couldn't
help
herself
,
that
the
panic
arose
in
her
unwanted
.

She
could
always
predict
what
Stanley
was
going
to
do
,
ever
since
she
first
met
him
.

Except
for
that
one
morning
.

Stanley
went
along
in
life
,
she
knew
,
convinced
that
he
deserved
the
love
and
faith
of
no
woman
.

As
a
result
,
he
never
looked
for
it
.

a
woman
who
was
willing
to
give
him
love
,
faith
,
and
anything
else
a
woman
could
give
a
husband
.

Unquestionably
,
Blanche
loved
Stanley
.

There
was
no
reason
for
her
to
marry
someone
like
Stanley
Gilborn
,
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
marry
Stanley
.

That
night
the
two
of
them
left
for
a
week's
honeymoon
in
Acapulco
.

While
they
were
away
Blanche
came
into
the
office
every
morning
,
running
things
as
she
had
always
run
them
for
Stanley
,
going
through
the
week
in
a
dazed
stupor
,
getting
things
done
automatically
,
out
of
habit
.

She
stayed
away
for
ten
days
.

Right
,
said
the
fingerprint
man
.

His
hands
snatched
at
an
imaginary
bucket
,
swooping
down
hard
to
grab
it
and
coming
away
with
equal
snap
like
a
ball
that's
been
bounced
hard
.

In
the
same
way
he
pantomimed
grasping
a
mantel
and
bouncing
cleanly
off
that
,
pressing
his
hands
against
the
floor
and
bouncing
cleanly
off
that
.

If
Rose
Mallory's
killer
acted
this
way
,
catching
up
with
him
was
going
to
be
a
cinch
.

This
,
you
will
remember
,
was
still
New
Year's
Day
.

Felix
was
the
exception
.

That
,
incidentally
,
might
give
you
some
idea
of
what
Felix
was
like
.

The
M.E.'s
boys
had
finished
their
on-the-spot
examination
and
the
body
had
been
removed
for
autopsy
.

Can
you
imagine
yourself
forgetting
under
the
circumstances
that
you
are
approaching
this
startling
and
unexpected
situation
so
unsuitably
hatted
and
armed
with
a
paper
horn
?
?

They'll
tell
you
what's
cooking
.

Even
then
,
as
you
go
into
the
house
oppressed
by
the
knowledge
that
something
is
cooking
and
that
your
house
has
passed
under
this
unaccountable
,
official
control
,
could
you
go
on
forgetting
that
you
still
had
that
ridiculous
hat
on
your
head
and
you
were
still
carrying
that
childish
horn
in
your
hand
?
?

He
,
of
course
,
must
have
been
equally
unprepared
for
what
confronted
him
,
but
,
nonetheless
,
I
did
find
his
reaction
startling
.

This
was
a
bull
of
a
man
.

His
face
was
ruddy
and
heavy
and
unlined
,
and
when
he
laughed
he
showed
his
teeth
,
which
were
big
and
white
and
strong
and
unquestionably
home-grown
.

We
waited
till
he
had
finished
laughing
,
and
that
gave
us
a
few
moments
for
taking
stock
of
him
.

That
much
Latin
we
remember
,
Gibby
said
dryly
.

What's
the
rest
of
your
name
?
?

All
there
ever
was
?
?

Is
there
any
other
time
in
which
a
man
can
live
?
?

He
is
a
fingerprint
specialist
.

The
happy
one
could
never
have
looked
happier
.

So
intricate
,
so
beautiful
.

Gibby
called
him
back
.

That
important
.

Shh
,
Felix
implored
.

Nothing
could
make
it
necessary
to
proclaim
it
to
the
whole
world
.

Obligingly
Gibby
lowered
his
voice
.

For
years
it's
been
just
Felix
.

Also
,
if
we
had
excluded
the
ladies
we
would
have
to
that
extent
let
the
whole
world
know
at
least
that
much
of
where
we
stood
.

If
you
can
possibly
avoid
it
,
you
don't
hand
out
any
extra
chances
.

Felix
took
us
into
his
studio
.

When
Felix
first
opened
the
door
on
it
,
all
these
shades
were
tightly
drawn
and
the
whole
studio
was
as
dark
as
night
.

There
were
tools
about
but
they
were
neatly
kept
.

Memory
flooded
him
the
instant
he
opened
his
eyes
and
the
sick
feeling
knotted
his
stomach
.

Presumably
the
same
sun
was
shining
upon
little
Drew
also
,
and
those
who
had
kidnapped
him
.

It
was
still
a
very
big
world
,
despite
all
the
modern
cant
to
the
contrary
.

Hub
was
sitting
in
a
chair
that
blocked
the
hall
door
.

Questions
about
the
show
tonight
.

they
had
nothing
to
give
to
each
other
.

He
asked
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
.

Andy
invented
a
job
to
keep
him
busy
,
sending
him
ahead
to
El
Dorado
to
supervise
last
minute
arrangements
.

At
last
it
was
time
to
depart
.

They
had
come
not
to
admire
but
to
observe
.

It's
worse
inside
,
Thornburg
informed
Andy
.

Under
the
heading
of
it's
an
ill
wind
,
et
cetera
.

But
in
his
dressing
room
was
a
large
bouquet
and
a
card
that
read
,
We
are
with
you
all
the
way
.

Andy
told
him
,
Bake
,
I
wish
you'd
talk
to
Skolman
,
see
if
some
kind
of
p.
a.
system
can
be
rigged
up
outside
.

I
wouldn't
want
him
to
miss
the
message
.

You
think
somebody
is
going
to
stand
up
in
the
audience
and
make
guilty
faces
?
?

Or
have
a
sign
on
his
car
that
says
,
'
Here
Comes
the
Paxton
Kidnapper
'
?
?

Andy
crumbled
the
script
in
his
fist
.

Someday
,
Bonner
said
,
you
are
going
to
ask
us
for
help
.

he
had
to
cling
to
routine
,
tested
procedures
.

To
act
otherwise
would
be
to
admit
his
helplessness
.

Andy's
performance
was
scheduled
for
eleven
o'clock
.

You
about
ready
?
?

Shirl
Winter
said
,
I'll
stay
on
the
phone
,
Mr.
Paxton
.

There's
a
couple
of
call-backs
I
can
work
on
.

Here's
where
luck
would
normally
step
in
.

The
effect
was
as
depressing
as
a
gravestone
,
the
applause
irresolute
and
short-lived
.

Yet
Andy
plowed
ahead
,
mouthing
the
inconsequential
words
as
if
they
possessed
real
meaning
,
and
gradually
his
listeners
warmed
to
him
.

Rocco
Vecchio
--
a
perspiring
,
haggard
Vecchio
--
was
standing
there
,
flanked
by
two
men
in
the
uniforms
of
armored
transport
guards
.

He
drew
a
deep
breath
.

He
sensed
rather
than
heard
the
gasp
that
swept
across
the
audience
.

This
particular
song
at
this
particular
time
could
only
be
interpreted
as
the
ultimate
in
bad
taste
,
callous
exploitation
beyond
the
bounds
of
decency
.

Otherwise
,
the
silence
was
complete
.

My
God
.

At
this
moment
,
all
he
could
think
of
was
what
he'd
been
forced
to
undergo
.

Who
needs
them
?
?

You'll
never
believe
the
places
I've
been
today
.

Andy
had
no
desire
to
linger
himself
but
Hub
reported
that
the
mob
outside
was
still
large
despite
the
efforts
of
the
police
to
disperse
them
.

Old
man
Arthur
had
put
down
the
suitcase
to
open
the
front
door
.

The
old
man
gave
the
room
a
stare
in
leaving
;
;

The
two
kids
were
together
a
lot
,
they
were
having
some
kind
of
teen-age
affair
--
God
knows
how
far
that
had
gone
--
and
the
kid's
crippled
.

His
father
looked
him
over
closely
.

You
should
have
gone
to
work
today
,
'stead
of
sneaking
around
spying
on
the
Dronk
house
.

Now
,
see
here
--

The
trouble
with
you
,
old
man
Arthur
began
,
and
then
checked
himself
.

Why
on
earth
did
I
send
him
off
to
work
?
?

His
voice
grew
high
and
trembling
.

I
can't
be
underfoot
every
time
those
cops
turn
around
!
!

I'd
think
that
you
even
more
than
I
would
be
wondering
what
they
are
up
to
.

Also
,
that
Mr.
Ferguson
was
here
.

She
slapped
the
receiver
into
its
holder
and
stepped
away
.

He
got
his
hat
out
of
the
closet
.

Let
her
call
Crosson
if
she
wanted
to
,
let
Crosson
raise
the
roof
or
even
can
him
,
he
didn't
care
.

Once
out
in
the
street
,
the
traffic
was
a
gadfly
maze
in
which
he
wandered
stricken
.

When
he
turned
into
the
highway
that
led
to
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
then
rose
toward
home
,
he
had
to
pull
over
to
the
curb
and
wait
for
a
few
minutes
,
sucking
in
air
and
squinting
and
blinking
his
eyes
to
clear
them
of
tears
.

There
had
been
nothing
evil
or
dirty
in
his
intentions
.

A
second
scene
flashed
before
his
mind
,
the
interior
of
the
garage
at
the
new
house
and
the
young
Bartlett
girl
turning
startled
to
meet
him
,
the
dim
dark
and
the
sudden
confusion
and
fear
and
then
the
brightness
as
Mae
had
clicked
on
the
light
.

He
hadn't
touched
her
.

And
when
he
came
to
examine
the
scene
,
there
was
a
certain
staginess
to
it
,
it
had
the
smell
of
planning
,
and
a
swift
suspicion
darted
into
his
mind
.

She
wouldn't
be
wilfully
planning
his
destruction
.

He
had
the
feeling
that
he
should
abandon
the
car
and
run
off
somewhere
to
hide
.

he
was
straight
,
something
angry
in
his
attitude
,
as
if
he
might
be
waiting
to
report
something
.

A
new
idea
drifted
in
from
nowhere
.

It
would
be
such
a
relief
.

What
was
that
old
sign
,
supposed
to
be
painted
over
a
door
somewhere
,
Abandon
hope
,
all
ye
who
enter
here
?
?

Sure
,
they
are
giving
up
hope
.

He
drove
into
the
paved
space
before
the
garage
and
got
out
,
slamming
the
car
door
.

She
had
a
cup
of
something
steaming
,
coffee
perhaps
,
in
one
hand
,
a
fresh
piece
of
toast
in
the
other
.

I've
been
looking
for
them
,
and
they
are
gone
.

I
don't
remember
any
overalls
at
all
.

She
took
another
bite
of
toast
.

More
like
this
,
maybe
?
?

Men
blew
dust
on
objects
in
a
room
on
the
seventeenth
floor
of
the
Hotel
Dumont
and
blew
it
off
again
,
and
did
the
same
in
a
tiny
,
almost
airless
room
in
a
tenement
in
the
West
Forties
.

And
men
also
used
vacuum
cleaners
in
both
rooms
,
sucking
dust
up
once
more
.

With
names
and
addresses
listed
,
verification
came
next
.

Failing
to
find
what
was
wanted
,
as
was
most
likely
,
check
out
other
guests
,
with
special
--
but
not
exclusive
--
attention
to
those
with
rooms
on
the
street
.

)
And
know
,
while
all
this
went
on
,
that
there
was
no
real
reason
to
suppose
that
the
murderer
had
been
a
guest
in
either
hotel
.

There
was
also
the
one
salient
question
to
ask
,
and
ask
widely
:
Did
you
notice
anything
out
of
the
way
?
?

Anybody
carrying
anything
that
might
hide
a
rifle
?
?

Or
long
fat
suitcase
,
for
that
matter
?
?

But
nothing
,
it
appeared
,
long
enough
to
attract
attention
.

Cases
,
say
,
for
musical
instruments
?
?

Several
at
the
King
Arthur
.

The
lab
to
check
.

She
might
,
conceivably
,
have
brought
one
in
in
a
large-enough
suitcase
.

)
She
might
now
have
taken
it
away
again
.

Heaven
knew
it
happened
and
hell
knew
it
too
.

Seeing
the
man
he
blamed
for
this
made
much
of
--
youth
and
bitterness
and
--

Bill
picked
up
the
telephone
;
;

A
man
named
Blaine
Smythe
,
with
y
and
e
but
pronounced
without
them
,
had
been
fired
at
Payne's
insistence
.

He
was
also
,
if
Pam
North
was
right
,
a
closer
acquaintance
of
Lauren
Payne's
than
she
,
now
,
was
inclined
to
admit
.

It
was
evident
that
Mullins
was
the
man
to
go
.

But
at
this
the
one
too-large
cat
suddenly
became
two
cats
,
stretching
.

After
a
time
,
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
thoughts
were
not
worth
the
trouble
.

A
vague
feeling
that
Anthony
Payne
had
had
it
coming
was
hardly
a
thought
and
was
,
in
any
event
,
reprehensible
.

Two
martinis
for
lunch
--
that
was
the
trouble
.

You
just
--
Hello
?
?

Not
unless
they
have
--

Much
better
to
break
a
cellar
window
.

And
a
pane
of
glass
isn't
hard
to
--

With
his
free
hand
he
pulled
a
pad
and
pencil
toward
him
and
began
to
make
notes
as
he
listened
,
saying
,
Uh-huh
and
I
see
at
intervals
.

No
signs
of
these
,
no
gross
hemorrhage
of
lungs
,
heart
,
brain
or
stomach
.

The
duration
of
the
digestive
process
varies
,
the
pathologist
says
,
but
the
empty
stomach
and
the
findings
in
the
upper
gastrointestinal
tract
indicate
that
Mrs.
Meeker
died
several
hours
after
her
seven-o'clock
dinner
.

He
had
to
look
for
other
prospects
,
other
motives
until
more
conclusive
evidence
pointing
to
Johnston
came
to
light
.

that
she
was
active
in
the
Woman's
Club
and
he
in
Lions
,
Rotary
,
and
Jaycee
;
;

and
finally
,
that
neither
of
them
had
harbored
an
unorthodox
opinion
since
their
wedding
day
.

Even
two
or
three
years
ago
I
doubt
that
she'd
have
become
involved
in
this
unfortunate
Johnston
affair
.

She
always
did
before
,
and
showed
the
utmost
confidence
in
whatever
we
advised
.

A
splendid
vote
of
confidence
in
Thayer
,
Madden
reflected
.

He
went
on
to
personal
bequests
,
a
list
of
names
largely
unknown
to
him
.

to
the
Pecks
,
ten
thousand
each
;
;

(
No
additional
five
thousand
for
each
year
after
Joan's
twenty-first
birthday
;
;

Too
bad
,
Madden
thought
.

Arthur
Williams's
might
well
have
been
included
,
he
felt
.

Madden
took
up
this
point
with
Garth
,
who
shrugged
it
off
.

There
was
no
telling
how
she'd
react
to
spending
money
.

Madden
inquired
next
about
the
audit
of
the
scholarship
fund
.

He
lived
in
an
apartment
house
not
over
three
or
four
years
old
,
a
reclaimed
island
of
landscaped
brick
and
glass
on
the
fringe
of
the
business
district
.

Airy
and
bright
,
the
apartment
was
furnished
with
good
modern
furniture
,
rugs
,
and
draperies
.

It's
all
I
think
about
,
too
.

Hoag
said
,
I
didn't
send
for
you
,
Leigh
.

It's
all
in
your
mind
.

Griffith
looked
at
him
suspiciously
through
red-rimmed
eyes
.

You
wouldn't
pull
my
leg
,
old
man
?
?

I
was
hit
--
knocked
out
.

Now
will
you
get
him
?
?

Who'd
hit
you
in
the
head
?
?

Nevertheless
it's
true
.

Where'd
you
expect
,
the
john
?
?

They
won't
even
let
you
in
the
front
door
.

So
why
don't
you
be
a
good
boy
and
--

If
you
want
to
spend
another
day
in
the
State
Department
--
another
day
--
you
get
in
there
and
tell
that
captain
what
I
told
you
.

The
way
Hoag
was
,
no
telling
what
he
might
say
or
do
.

Yes
,
what
is
it
?
?

He
spotted
Docherty
coming
out
of
a
room
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
and
called
to
him
.

Well
?
?

Griffith
said
,
Hoag
told
me
to
tell
you
--
he
waited
until
they
were
close
;
;

Griffith
looked
half-crocked
to
the
captain
;
;

He
claims
Mahzeer's
in
a
plot
to
kill
the
P.M.
.

Docherty
went
taut
:
was
it
possible
?
?

he
wasn't
going
to
allow
himself
to
be
led
meekly
to
the
slaughter
.

Haven't
the
faintest
,
Captain
.

Would
you
mind
sending
him
up
here
?
?

I'd
like
to
talk
to
him
.

Troubled
,
he
continued
along
the
corridor
,
poking
his
head
into
the
next
office
for
a
careful
look
around
.

If
Mahzeer
was
alone
with
the
prime
minister
he
could
be
arranging
his
execution
while
Hoag
stood
out
here
shivering
in
the
darkening
street
.

He
and
the
prime
minister
would
be
back
from
the
window
,
seated
at
Mahzeer's
desk
;
;

Hoag
would
carry
its
sound
to
his
grave
.

Mahzeer
,
of
course
,
would
be
desolate
.

How
was
he
to
suspect
that
an
assassin
had
been
lurking
somewhere
across
the
street
waiting
for
just
such
a
chance
?
?

two
others
he
ruled
out
because
all
their
windows
were
lighted
.

He
went
on
to
the
next
building
and
found
what
he
expected
--
the
mingled
cooking
aromas
of
a
public
vestibule
.

On
one
wall
was
the
brass
front
of
a
row
of
mailboxes
;
;

all
were
empty
except
one
,
and
that
one
was
jammed
with
letters
and
magazines
.

It
had
been
shut
again
,
but
the
lock
was
broken
;
;

Was
there
time
?
?

His
thoughts
were
scattered
by
the
sharp
report
of
a
rifle
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
.

The
clerk
wagged
his
head
toward
the
captain's
office
.

Leave
me
alone
,
Gun
thought
.

He
was
silent
again
,
possibly
listening
to
the
sounds
in
the
squadroom
.

The
day-watch
platoon
commander
,
Lt.
Rinker
,
was
calling
out
the
beat
assignments
,
but
Matson
couldn't
make
the
names
mean
anything
.

Killpath
leaned
forward
;
;

I
was
out
in
the
district
,
sir
.

So
I
have
heard
.

He
stared
at
the
report
in
Killpath's
hand
,
sure
it
was
written
by
Accacia
--
just
as
sure
as
if
he'd
submitted
it
in
his
scrawled
longhand
.

Killpath
licked
his
lips
.

Patrolman
Accacia
is
an
alert
and
conscientious
law-enforcement
officer
.

Let's
not
push
our
patience
beyond
the
danger
line
,
Sergeant
,
Killpath
nasaled
.

An
argument
with
Orville
Torrence
Killpath
was
as
frustrating
and
as
futile
as
a
cap
pistol
on
a
firing
range
.

Morning
,
Lieutenant
Rinker
.

I
thought
you
hadn't
come
in
yet
.

It
was
the
best
he
could
hope
for
on
a
watch
that
had
ended
with
a
session
in
Killpath's
office
.

Not
that
he
gave
a
damn
what
the
grapevine
sent
out
about
Killpath's
little
speech
on
the
comportment
of
platoon
commanders
.

Aside
from
the
fact
that
business
was
slow
this
time
of
year
and
his
one
salesgirl
was
not
the
most
enterprising
,
Mr.
Phillips
had
no
worries
at
all
,
and
he
said
as
much
to
Gun
Matson
,
who
sat
across
from
him
in
civilian
clothes
,
on
a
Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed
,
mauve
velour
,
$79.89
nothing-down
special
!
!

A
time
plan
is
a
mere
convenience
,
you
understand
,
and
when
--
He
interrupted
himself
,
smiling
.

That
way
I
don't
lose
so
much
.

Why
don't
you
just
hire
somebody
else
?
?

I
asked
her
why
she
couldn't
do
it
tomorrow
,
but
it
seems
the
muse
is
working
good
tonight
and
she's
afraid
to
let
it
go
.

He
was
always
well
groomed
and
well
tailored
,
and
he
had
that
rich
man's
look
which
was
authentic
enough
and
came
from
two
good
prep
schools
and
a
proper
university
.

The
girl's
eyes
were
softly
shining
as
she
reached
out
and
touched
Casey's
hand
.

We
are
going
to
get
married
.

Do
you
approve
?
?

None
of
this
showed
in
his
face
,
and
he
tried
to
keep
his
skepticism
in
hand
.

Of
course
not
.

If
you
are
really
serious
about
working
on
that
story
,
I'd
better
take
you
home
.

Casey
watched
them
go
,
still
frowning
absently
and
then
dismissing
the
matter
as
he
called
for
his
check
.

In
fact
,
he
did
not
think
about
Jerry
Burton
at
all
until
he
entered
his
living
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
.

I
knew
the
only
way
I
could
beat
you
was
to
play
possum
,
but
it
was
a
good
try
,
kid
,
and
I
appreciate
it
.

For
another
second
or
two
he
gave
in
to
the
annoyance
that
was
directed
at
himself
;
;

then
his
mind
moved
on
to
be
confronted
by
something
far
more
serious
,
and
as
the
thought
expanded
,
the
implications
jarred
him
.

He
considered
them
with
brooding
eyes
,
brows
bunched
as
his
brain
grappled
with
the
problem
and
tried
to
find
some
solution
.

Maybe
he
only
intended
to
scare
the
blackmailer
,
whoever
he
was
,
in
which
case
an
unloaded
gun
would
be
good
enough
.

Who
says
so
?
?

Calenda
was
not
the
sort
who
walked
around
without
one
of
his
boys
close
at
hand
.

Even
so
,
he
generally
listened
and
was
usually
reasonable
to
those
who
voiced
their
objections
properly
.

His
nerves
were
getting
a
little
ragged
and
his
impatience
put
an
edge
in
his
voice
.

You
tell
him
.

He
had
done
all
he
could
and
that
was
that
.

He
,
Casey
,
had
been
scared
for
a
while
,
but
that
had
come
mostly
from
the
fact
that
he
felt
responsible
.

For
over
the
years
he
had
received
many
such
calls
.

Only
an
occasional
tip
turned
out
to
be
a
phony
,
and
,
like
the
police
,
Casey
had
made
a
point
of
running
down
all
such
suggestions
and
he
did
not
hesitate
this
time
.

Poet
came
in
,
raising
his
eyebrows
appreciatively
as
he
saw
Elaine
.

Pretty
quick
,
she
replied
.

Poet
nodded
,
swung
below
and
a
moment
later
emerged
from
the
forward
hatch
where
he
picked
up
the
anchor
.

The
rock
and
roll
music
coming
from
the
radio
station
suddenly
faded
as
the
boat
coasted
into
the
null
on
the
Aj
.

She
cut
the
engines
and
slowly
the
cruiser
swung
around
on
the
end
of
its
lines
until
its
bow
was
pointing
into
the
wind
and
the
cockpit
faced
toward
the
shore
.

Nick
watched
her
somewhat
enviously
as
she
efficiently
cut
the
engines
,
and
started
the
auxiliary
motor
.

No
one
had
screamed
.

No
one
had
prayed
.

Hydraulic
?
?

They
are
the
most
efficient
.

And
the
deadliest
,
Poet
commented
as
he
buckled
on
his
tank
harness
.

Clasping
his
hands
behind
his
head
,
he
stared
at
the
blue
sky
.

Alfredo
certainly
must
have
enjoyed
being
alone
.

But
Graham
hadn't
stumbled
on
it
.

That
was
a
hell
of
a
note
,
he
thought
.

Poet
shook
his
head
,
sliding
his
face
mask
up
on
his
forehead
.

Poet
a
murderer
?
?

Elaine
turned
and
started
toward
the
companionway
.

But
her
walk
was
too
steady
,
too
slow
,
telegraphing
her
fear
.

But
Nick
would
not
let
go
.

Poet
twisted
again
and
Nick's
knuckles
scraped
on
the
air
tank
,
ripping
off
the
skin
.

The
discovery
struck
Nick
like
a
blow
.

Instinctively
he
exhaled
through
his
nose
then
sucked
in
the
air
from
the
hose
.

Harbor
Point
sticks
out
into
the
ocean
like
the
fat
neck
of
a
steamer
clam
.

It's
a
rich
village
but
not
much
for
action
--
too
many
solid
residents
,
not
enough
tourists
or
working
stiffs
.

His
sarcasm
was
followed
by
a
stupid
grin
of
his
thick
mouth
and
bad
teeth
.

Don't
worry
about
my
being
tough
,
Moore
.

Julia
asks
me
to
come
out
at
once
.

I
got
there
at
9:47
A.M.
,
found
her
strangled
.

We
walked
up
Main
Street
to
this
big
white
house
,
then
around
to
the
back
.

There
was
a
garage
and
a
modern
barn
in
the
rear
,
all
of
it
standing
between
two
large
flat
fields
planted
in
early
potatoes
.

Everything
shouted
gentleman
farming
,
the
kind
of
grandfather-father-to-son
folding
money
the
Point
is
known
for
.

The
fins
of
a
Caddy
were
sticking
out
of
the
garage
,
while
the
inside
of
the
house
was
a
comfortable
mixture
of
old
and
expensive
contemporary
furniture
.

She
was
also
stone
deaf
in
her
right
ear
.

I
went
up
stairs
and
did
the
bath
and
her
bedroom
--
way
I
always
do
in
the
morning
.

Okay
,
come
on
.

Mrs.
Williams
was
both
sullen
and
frightened
.

She
hadn't
seen
him
since
.

He
strong
as
a
bull
but
gentle
as
a
baby
.

I'll
tell
him
--
if
I
see
him
.

I
tried
not
to
act
scared
.

I
told
Moore
I
was
going
to
eat
,
get
some
forms
filled
out
by
Doc
Abel
.

Lighting
my
pipe
,
I
took
a
walk
.

I
asked
an
old
guy
running
a
fishing
station
if
the
boat
was
Moore's
.

Bob
Moore
is
plumb
crazy
about
blue
fishing
.

I
dropped
into
the
doctor's
office
,
picked
up
my
forms
.

As
I
was
walking
back
to
the
Police
Station
,
which
was
in
the
same
building
with
the
City
Hall
and
Post
Office
,
I
saw
Mrs.
Tim
Williams
sneaking
into
the
back
of
my
car
.

I
got
into
the
front
seat
.

Take
the
same
train
Diana
Beauclerk
took
and
get
there
at
the
same
time
.

The
police
have
finished
with
it
.

Still
,
they
may
not
want
to
rent
it
.

For
what
!
!

Ten
to
one
,
it's
even
been
redecorated
!
!

A
sudden
thought
wiped
the
smirk
from
his
face
.

That
is
exactly
what
I
am
hoping
for
.

After
all
,
the
murderer
is
still
at
large
.

Daniel
Forbes
,
her
divorced
husband
,
lived
there
.

No
other
visitor
inquired
for
her
that
evening
.

Forbes
had
motive
and
Stacy
had
opportunity
.

He
studied
the
night
clerk
as
a
man
measures
an
adversary
.

At
the
same
rate
.

Of
course
not
!
!

Alec
leaned
on
the
desk
,
holding
the
clerk's
eyes
with
his
.

Suppose
you
tell
me
the
real
reason
,
he
drawled
.

Show
this
gentleman
to
1105
!
!

He
wished
it
had
not
been
necessary
to
announce
the
number
of
his
suite
quite
so
publicly
.

The
room
was
dark
but
a
neon
sign
flashed
and
faded
beyond
the
window
.

Deal
furniture
with
a
mahogany
finish
was
neatly
arranged
as
if
it
stood
in
the
window
of
a
department
store
.

The
blue
rug
was
suspiciously
bright
and
new
.

Alec
played
the
part
of
an
innocent
tourist
.

Is
there
anything
wrong
with
this
room
?
?

The
boy
dropped
his
eyes
.

Then
,
I
am
not
talking
.

But
I
wouldn't
spend
a
night
in
here
for
a
million
bucks
!
!

Alec
gave
him
a
tip
and
let
him
go
.

Women
didn't
use
white
face
powder
nowadays
,
he
recalled
.

Blood
in
the
bathtub
where
the
murderer
appears
to
have
washed
his
hands
.

It
seemed
clean
now
,
but
Alec
decided
against
a
bath
.

In
the
darkness
he
could
see
the
rosy
reflection
of
the
neon
sign
on
the
wall
opposite
the
window
.

There
was
no
sound
and
apparently
no
movement
in
the
room
except
the
noiseless
pulsation
of
the
red
light
on
the
wall
.

He
lay
still
,
listening
to
the
silence
,
watching
the
light
.

His
heart
seemed
to
swell
and
knock
against
the
wall
of
his
chest
.

That
meant
that
something
between
the
light
and
its
reflection
on
the
wall
was
moving
closer
to
the
source
of
the
light
--
in
this
case
,
the
window
.

The
bedsprings
betrayed
him
with
a
creak
.

Again
he
groped
for
the
light
switch
.

A
professional
gunman
would
not
have
killed
her
with
a
weapon
of
such
small
caliber
as
a

What
are
you
doing
here
?
?

The
silence
was
getting
on
Alec's
nerves
.

The
man
opened
his
mouth
,
but
no
words
came
.

Only
that
curious
,
animal
grunting
Alec
had
heard
during
their
fight
.

A
forefinger
pointed
toward
his
gullet
.

You
must
know
what
gets
into
people
,
even
such
as
Red
and
Handley
,
before
you
can
tell
what
comes
out
of
them
.

They
had
learned
,
both
of
them
,
about
Abraham
Wharf
.

And
my
point
in
this
sad
story
is
the
spirit
of
the
matter
.

When
you
hold
the
spirit
of
a
thing
,
then
somehow
you
know
the
truth
--
you
know
a
fake
antique
from
the
real
thing
.

There
were
no
witch
burnings
here
because
everyone
had
a
witch
in
the
family
.

Today
Dogtown
is
the
only
deserted
village
in
all
New
England
that
I
know
of
.

Those
who
lived
in
that
desolation
of
rocky
deformity
took
on
some
of
the
moraine's
stony
character
.

Handley
lived
further
on
,
at
Pigeon
Cove
.

What
should
one
say
?
?

Sea-road
,
railroad
,
lack
of
water
,
killed
Dogtown
.

Why
,
that's
what
gave
me
the
feeling
,
gave
me
as-it-were
the
spirit
,
the
demoniac
,
evil
spirit
of
this
whole
affair
.

No
,
I
don't
hold
with
those
who
live
entirely
among
dead
things
.

He's
always
like
that
,
in
spite
of
being
a
big
man
.

But
for
my
presence
,
they
would
have
been
at
each
others'
throats
.

After
the
usual
Honorable
Sirs
,
it
went
on
to
say
that
there
had
been
set
off
to
the
widow
one
full
third
part
of
the
real
estate
of
the
deceased
Salu
Norberg
,
one
lower
room
,
on
the
Western
side
,
privileges
to
the
well
and
bake-oven
and
to
one
third
of
the
cellar
(
I
can
show
you
the
cellar
when
we
go
up
)
,
also
one
Cow
Right
,
and
lastly
they
set
off
to
the
widow
her
own
land
that
she
brought
with
her
as
dower
,
namely
the
Beech
Pasture
.

One
other
cause
of
jealousy
between
them
I
must
tell
you
.

I
would
call
them
the
patterns
of
life
,
perhaps
even
the
designs
of
destiny
.

Oh
yes
,
he'd
talked
about
doing
so
.

I
suppose
these
absences
gave
her
more
clearance
for
her
embraces
with
Cousin
Handley
.

Haney
peered
doubtfully
at
his
drinking
companion
through
bleary
,
tear-filled
eyes
.

But
his
new-found
buddy
had
matched
him
drink
for
drink
until
he
lost
count
,
and
the
man's
eyes
were
still
clear
.

Actually
,
he
regretted
having
opened
his
mouth
when
the
truck
came
to
a
stop
and
the
angry
driver
jumped
down
from
the
cab
and
walked
back
toward
them
.

By
then
,
the
stranger
was
thanking
Haney
profusely
and
had
one
arm
around
his
shoulders
as
if
he
were
an
old
friend
.

Very
suddenly
,
the
driver
stopped
swearing
at
them
,
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
back
to
his
truck
.

And
when
the
stranger
found
out
that
Phil
was
on
the
way
to
one
of
his
favorite
bars
,
he
insisted
on
offering
to
buy
drinks
for
both
of
them
.

But
he
decided
he
wouldn't
mind
company
in
return
for
free
drinks
,
even
though
he
made
good
money
at
his
job
.

I
think
you
aren't
taking
me
seriously
,
Phil
.

And
everybody
has
some
kind
of
grudge
.

He
really
didn't
expect
anything
to
come
of
it
,
and
there
were
a
few
people

When
he
looked
up
again
,
he
seemed
almost
contented
.

You
see
,
I
always
make
it
look
like
an
accident
.

Phil
shrugged
and
ignored
him
.

By
Wednesday
the
landlord
was
still
alive
.

Of
course
On
Thursday
,
Haney
mailed
the
monthly
check
for
separate
maintenance
to
his
wife
Lolly
,
and
wished
the
stranger
could
do
something
about
her

Haney
hoped
that
nobody
noticed
his
sudden
pallor
,
as
he
felt
the
blood
drain
from
his
cheeks
.

Haney
went
to
bed
,
happy
that
at
least
he
was
rid
of
that
lousy
landlord
.

Really
,
he
said
to
himself
,
nobody
kills
a
man
just
as
a
favor
!
!

He
had
already
quite
forgotten
about
him
.

Toward
the
end
of
his
fourth
hairy
highball
,
while
he
was
moodily
making
wet
rings
on
the
table-top
with
the
bottom
of
the
glass
,
he
became
aware
that
he
was
not
alone
.

--
he
hadn't
seen
him
sit
down
.

The
man
was
uncanny
,
like
a
shadow
,
and
made
as
much
noise
as
a
shadow
.

Haney
felt
like
shrinking
out
of
sight
,
but
he
was
already
trapped
in
the
corner
with
the
wiry
,
dark
little
man
.

The
guy
sulked
over
his
drink
,
obviously
upset
by
Haney's
lack
of
appreciation
.

In
time
,
and
two
drinks
later
,
he
was
complaining
bitterly
about
his
wife
,
He
was
on
the
subject
for
ten
minutes
or
so
when
he
noticed
the
renewed
interest
in
his
listener
--
it
showed
in
the
alert
face
and
the
suddenly
bright
eyes
.

Community

you
know
.

She
can
drop
dead
!
!

That's
why
I
--
why
I
do
a
free
job
now
and
then
.

A
retired
professional
killer
If
he
was
just
a
nut
,
no
harm
was
done
.

It
could
have
been
an
accident
.

floor
level's
about
three
feet
down
,
so
don't
fall
.

He
said
,
Jist
stay
still
.

He
drank
and
handed
it
back
.

On
the
way
I'll
give
you
the
scoop
.

there
was
no
hurry
.

I
said
,
Wait
wait
to
Charlie
and
he
grinned
,
digging
the
reference
.

When
he
handed
it
back
and
I
had
hold
of
it
safely
,
Pops
was
looking
toward
me
and
I
said
Now
,
to
Charlie
and
he
swung
the
short
length
of
lead
pipe
he'd
meanwhile
taken
from
his
pocket
,
once
.

and
he'd
never
known
what
hit
him
--
he'd
never
known
that
anything
had
hit
him
.

To
kayo
him
and
maybe
or
maybe
not
kill
.

All
right
,
now
I'll
give
you
a
hand
.

Now
,
first
question
:
the
bottles
.

If
we
left
one
we'd
have
to
wipe
it
for
fingerprints
.

If
they'd
been
working
on
a
bottle
or
a
jug
he'd
have
taken
it
with
him
.

And
he'd
have
taken
the
weapon
with
him
too
,
so
we
take
that
.

There
are
the
boards
over
the
window
,
of
course
,
but
they
are
not
painted
and
too
rough
to
take
prints
.

Winsett
is
a
quiet
street
with
no
taverns
and
was
completely
deserted
at
that
hour
.

We
shook
hands
on
it
.

From
here
on
in
,
the
less
Charlie
and
I
were
seen
together
in
public
,
or
visited
one
another's
rooms
,
the
better
.

I
was
dead
tired
and
slept
soundly
,
as
far
as
I
know
dreamlessly
.

Shall
we
flip
a
coin
to
see
which
of
us
goes
first
?
?

Or
would
you
rather
deal
a
hand
of
show-down
poker
or
play
a
game
of
gin
rummy
,
or
what
?
?

One
thing
we
haven't
discussed
,
expense
money
.

I've
got
a
little
stashed
for
a
rainy
day
,
and
I
guess
this
is
rainy
enough
.

I
took
a
deep
breath
,
and
the
plunge
.

But
your
friend
Manny
can
go
any
time
.

Mike
stopped
to
cherish
all
his
brother
selves
,
the
many
threes-fulfilled
on
Mars
,
corporate
and
discorporate
,
the
precious
few
on
Earth
--
the
unknown
powers
of
three
on
Earth
that
would
be
his
to
merge
with
and
cherish
now
that
at
last
long
waiting
he
grokked
and
cherished
himself
.

there
was
much
to
grok
,
loose
ends
to
puzzle
over
and
fit
into
his
growing
--
all
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
and
been
at
the
Archangel
Foster
Tabernacle
(
not
just
cusp
when
he
and
Digby
had
come
face
to
face
alone
)
why
Bishop
Senator
Boone
made
him
warily
uneasy
,
how
Miss
Dawn
Ardent
tasted
like
a
water
brother
when
she
was
not
,
the
smell
of
goodness
he
had
incompletely
grokked
in
the
jumping
up
and
down
and
wailing
--

The
word
church
which
turned
up
over
and
over
again
among
Jubal's
words
gave
him
knotty
difficulty
;
;

Where
is
everybody
?
?

he
wanted
to
explain
his
new
grokking
.

It's
plenty
warm
.

Jubal
said
that
his
night-sight
probably
came
from
the
conditions
in
which
he
had
grown
up
,
and
Mike
grokked
this
was
true
but
grokked
that
there
was
more
to
it
;
;

As
for
the
night
being
warm
,
he
would
have
been
comfortable
naked
on
Mount
Everest
but
his
water
brothers
had
little
tolerance
for
changes
in
temperature
and
pressure
;
;

it
was
a
goodness
,
beauty
.

Of

humans
we
left
at
the
equator
,
one
has
discorporated
and
the
others
are
sad
.

he
had
not
known
it
until
asked
.

They
should
not
be
sad
.

Oh
,
dear
!
!

For
Mars
?
?

Kiss
me
again
.

Is
that
--
I
mean
,
'
Do
you
know
'
--

It
is
for
growing
closer
.

Now
we
grow
closer
.

Well
I've
been
ready
a
long
time
--
goodness
,
we
all
have
,
but
never
mind
,
dear
;
;

turn
just
a
little
.

Her
answer
was
not
in
words
.

We
grok
God
.

Part
of
the
time
saved
was
spent
on
a
preliminary
estimate
for
a
long-distance
plan

free

of

to
make

Fosterite
bishops
,
after
secret
conclave
,
announced
the
Church's
second
Major
Miracle
:
Supreme
Bishop
Digby
had
been
translated
bodily
to
Heaven
and
spot-promoted
to
Archangel
,
ranking
with-but-after
Archangel
Foster
.

The
glorious
news
had
been
held
up
pending
Heavenly
confirmation
of
the
elevation
of
a
new
Supreme
Bishop
,
Huey
Short
--
a
candidate
accepted
by
the
Boone
faction
after
lots
had
been
cast
repeatedly
.

L'Unita
and
Hoy
published
identical
denunciations
of
Short's
elevation
,
l'Osservatore
Romano
and
the
Christian
Science
Monitor
ignored
it
,
Times
of
India
snickered
at
it
,
and
the
Manchester
Guardian
simply
reported
it
--
the
Fosterites
in
England
were
few
but
extremely
militant
.

if
Mike
had
had
a
finger
in
it
,
he
had
gotten
away
with
it
--
and
what
happened
to
supreme
bishops
worried
Jubal
not
at
all
as
long
as
he
wasn't
bothered
.

Anyhow
,
it
was
high
time
the
boy
was
salted
.

The
girls
seemed
to
spend
half
their
time
tiptoeing
in
to
see
if
Mike
was
all
right
and
they
were
too
preoccupied
to
cook
,
much
less
be
secretaries
.

Absent-minded
,
subject
to
unexplained
tears
Jubal
would
have
bet
his
life
that
if
Anne
were
to
witness
the
Second
Coming
,
she
would
memorize
date
,
time
,
personae
,
events
,
and
barometric
pressure
without
batting
her
calm
blue
eyes
.

We
have
learned
much
about
interstellar
drives
since
a
hundred
years
ago
;
;

That
it
had
found
a
planet
on
which
human
beings
could
live
and
which
was
already
inhabited
by
sentient
beings
!
!

Said
Hal
,
forgetting
in
his
enthusiasm
that
he
had
not
been
asked
to
speak
.

He
was
a
good
impresser
,
that
Pornsen
.

Swiftly
,
came
the
revulsion
,
the
protest
.

But
did
the
expedition
find
any
records
of
the
Forerunner
having
been
on
this
planet
?
?

We
have
considered
several
of
your
professionals
because
they
were
lamechians
and
above
suspicion
.

I
am
married
.

Tell
me
more
,
Sandalphon
.

Six
months
later
,
Hal
Yarrow
stood
in
the
observation
dome
of
the
Gabriel
and
watched
the
ball
of
Earth
dwindle
above
him
.

Southern
China
,
all
of
southeast
Asia
,
southern
India
and
Ceylon
,
these
states
of
the
Malay
Federation
spoke
Bazaar
.

His
mind
turned
the
globe
swiftly
for
him
,
and
he
visualized
Africa
,
which
used
Swahili
south
of
the
Sahara
Sea
.

This
was
no
man's
land
,
disputed
by
the
Haijac
Union
and
the
Israeli
Republic
,
a
potential
source
of
war
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
.

Then
there
was
North
America
,
where
American
was
the
native
speech
of
all
except
the
twenty
descendants
of
French-Canadians
living
on
the
Hudson
Bay
Preserve
.

Her
friends
and
professional
associates
would
sympathize
with
her
,
not
because
she
had
lost
a
beloved
husband
,
but
because
she
had
been
married
to
a
man
who
thought
unrealistically
.

And
,
therefore
,
being
in
disgrace
,
they
would
not
be
cremated
and
their
ashes
flung
to
the
winds
in
public
ceremony
.

Mary
was
free
to
marry
again
,
not
knowing
that
the
Sturch
had
secretly
given
her
a
divorce
,
thinking
that
death
had
dissolved
her
marriage
.

Hal
doubted
if
this
happy
event
would
occur
.

Mary
was
as
frozen
below
the
navel
as
he
.

Hal
Yarrow
!
!

My
beloved
ward
,
my
perennial
gadfly
,
said
the
whining
voice
.

Love
to
you
,
my
ward
.

Sigmen
love
you
,
too
,
my
guardian
,
said
Hal
,
choking
.

the
Gabriel
pointed
towards
her
destination
and
,
under
one-gee
acceleration
,
began
to
build
up
towards
her
ultimate
velocity
,
99.1
percent
of
the
speed
of
light
.

Meanwhile
,
all
the
personnel
except
those
few
needed
to
carry
out
the
performance
of
the
ship
,
went
into
the
suspensor
.

Many
years
later
,
the
photon-counting
apparatus
in
the
nose
of
the
ship
would
determine
that
the
star
was
close
enough
to
actuate
deceleration
.

Then
,
after
slowing
the
vessel
considerably
,
the
drive
would
adjust
to
a
one-gee
deceleration
.

And
the
crew
would
be
automatically
brought
out
of
their
suspended
animation
.

And
,
in
the
half-year
left
before
reaching
their
destination
,
the
men
would
carry
out
whatever
preparations
were
needed
.

Hal
Yarrow
was
among
the
last
to
go
into
the
suspensor
and
among
the
first
to
come
out
.

The
expedition
that
had
discovered
Ozagen
had
succeeded
in
correlating
two
thousand
Siddo
words
with
an
equal
number
of
American
words
.

His
duty
was
to
write
a
school
text
and
to
teach
the
entire
personnel
of
the
Gabriel
how
to
speak
Ozagen
.

Moreover
,
even
getting
this
across
would
be
difficult
.

It
was
true
that
they
could
be
approximated
,
but
would
the
Ozagenians
understand
these
approximations
?
?

Consider
the
tense
system
.

We
had
concluded
that
no
race
as
ephemeral
as
yours
could
have
had
time
to
develop
a
sense
of
justice
.

We
shall
recommend
to
them
that
they
shorten
your
trial
period
by
half
.

For
instance
,
Hesperus
agreed
to
help
me
find
my
property
,
and
I
agreed
to
take
him
to
Earth
.

Though
it
might
be
that
we
would
have
much
to
give
you
,
you
have
nothing
to
give
us
.

Hesperus
and
Lucifer
,
Jack
said
,
show
that
we
do
.

Yes
,
those
could
be
commodities
under
this
concept
.

What
Gabriel
was
asking
was
that
mankind
forego
all
its
parochial
moral
judgments
,
and
contract
to
let
the
Angels
serve
on
Earth
as
it
is
in
Heaven
regardless
of
the
applicable
Earth
laws
.

but
the
United
States
and
the
Union
of
Soviet
Socialist
Republics
nevertheless
did
eventually
agree
on
an
atomic
bomb
test
ban
,
and
a
sort
of
provisional
acceptance
of
each
other's
good
intentions
on
this
limited
question
.

Out
of
that
agreement
,
though
not
by
any
easy
road
,
eventually
emerged
the
present
world
hegemony
of
the
United
Nations
;
;

Suppose
that
this
one
were
to
work
?
?

There
was
no
question
in
Jack's
mind
of
the
good
faith
on
one
side
,
at
least
.

He
turned
back
to
the
screens
,
the
crucial
,
conclusive
phrase
on
his
lips
.

He
had
lost
his
audience
.

What's
going
on
here
?
?

Your
brothers
have
been
found
.

You
can't
see
them
yet
,
Jack
.

No
--
there
was
a
tiny
pip
on
the
radar
;
;

It
seemed
unlikely
that
her
crew
,
if
either
of
them
were
alive
,
could
even
see
the
Ariadne
,
for
they
were
passing
her
at
a
distance
of
nearly
a
light-year
.

It
was
clear
that
Langer
had
at
last
found
a
way
to
attract
the
Angel's
attention
.

Almost
surely
he
did
;
;

after
all
,
he
had
had
the
same
set
of
facts
as
Jack
had
had
to
work
from
,
and
he
was
an
almost
frighteningly
observant
man
.

Jack
crawled
under
the
boards
and
restored
the
six
feet
of
lead
line
he
had
excised
from
the
Nernst
generator
switch
.

When
he
was
back
on
his
feet
again
and
about
to
reinstall
the
fuses
,
however
,
he
hesitated
.

But
fusion
power
in
the
Coal
Sack
was
what
had
triggered
all
the
trouble
in
the
first
place
--
and
he
already
had
an
Angel
aboard
.

Will
you
obstruct
this
,
or
will
you
help
?
?

I
know
it's
not
part
of
the
bargain
,
and
your
elders
might
not
like
it
.

Ryan
hefted
his
bulk
up
and
supported
it
on
one
elbow
.

He
didn't
say
what
would
cure
him
;
;

he
had
been
explaining
all
during
the
trip
what
he
needed
to
make
him
feel
like
himself
.

Ekstrohm
?
?

A
range
of
bluffs
hugged
the
horizon
,
the
color
of
decaying
moss
.

Ryan
,
look
over
there
,
Nogol
said
.

Sonic
,
electronic
,
galvanic
--
all
blank
.

Easy
,
Nogol
confirmed
.

Positive
results
start
when
it
goes
towards
the
hand
you
use
to
make
your
mark
.

Ryan
told
him
what
he
could
do
then
.

Actually
,
the
types
of
infection
that
could
attack
a
warm-blooded
mammal
were
not
infinite
,
and
over
the
course
of
the
last
few
hundred
years
adequate
defenses
had
been
found
for
all
basic
categories
.

Uh-huh
,
Ryan
admitted
.

Statistical
average
and
all
.

Still
,
it
sometimes
gives
you
a
creepy
feeling
to
find
a
rabbit
or
a
snapping
turtle
on
some
strange
world
.

I
don't
know
,
Stormy
.

No
,
it
isn't
,
Ekstrohm
said
.

It
looks
like
we
did
,
when
we
made
blastdown
.

Radiation
?
?

I
don't
know
about
that
.

Maybe
it
would
work
the
other
way
.

Maybe
because
they
have
had
virtually
no
radioactive
exposure
and
don't
have
any
R's
stored
up
,
they
could
take
a
lot
without
harm
.

And
that
is
?
?

Ekstrohm
was
not
asleep
.

It
was
small
comfort
for
insomnia
.

Over
the
years
,
he
had
had
buddies
in
space
in
whom
he
thought
he
could
confide
.

In
a
camp
,
instead
of
shipboard
,
hiding
the
secret
was
easier
.

But
the
secret
itself
was
just
as
hard
.

On
impulse
,
he
flipped
up
the
heat
control
on
his
coverall
and
slid
back
the
hatch
of
the
bubble
.

It
took
him
a
few
seconds
to
put
his
thoughts
in
order
,
and
then
he
got
up
from
the
bunk
where
he
had
been
resting
,
sleeplessly
.

Okay
,
Stormy
,
this
isn't
the
place
for
fun
and
games
.

The
dead
beasties
.

All
the
dead
animals
laying
around
the
ship
.

What
are
you
talking
about
,
Ryan
?
?

Gone
?
?

Listen
,
Ekstrohm
,
I
want
to
give
you
the
benefit
of
every
doubt
.

What
could
I
do
with
your
lousy
dead
bodies
?
?

Suspicion
wasn't
new
to
him
at
all
.

Look
for
them
,
will
you
?
?

I
outweigh
you
fifty
pounds
and
I
am
fast
for
a
big
man
.

For
her
first
three
vegetable
months
she
waved
her
crabbed
claws
,
kicked
weakly
with
her
clubbed
feet
and
enjoyed
the
usual
routine
of
the
infant
.

She
was
not
alone
for
there
were
three
other
such
children
in
the
big
city's
special
nursery
.

One
of
the
babies
died
in
the
initial
transferral
but
of
Helva's
class
,
seventeen
thrived
in
the
metal
shells
.

As
long
as
her
development
within
her
shell
lived
up
to
expectations
,
and
there
were
no
side-effects
from
the
pituitary
tinkering
,
Helva
would
live
a
rewarding
,
rich
and
unusual
life
,
a
far
cry
from
what
she
would
have
faced
as
an
ordinary
,
normal
being
.

Not
so
obvious
to
her
,
but
of
more
importance
to
her
teachers
,
Helva
ingested
the
precepts
of
her
conditioning
as
easily
as
she
absorbed
her
nutrient
fluid
.

Helva's
civilization
was
not
without
busy
,
do-good
associations
,
exploring
possible
inhumanities
to
terrestrial
as
well
as
extraterrestrial
citizens
.

She
had
activated
one
of
her
microscopic
tools
which
she
would
later
use
for
minute
repairs
to
various
parts
of
her
control
panel
.

Shell
people
used
their
own
vocal
cords
and
diaphragms
but
sound
issued
through
microphones
rather
than
mouths
.

Helva's
hum
then
had
a
curious
vibrancy
,
a
warm
,
dulcet
quality
even
in
its
aimless
chromatic
wanderings
.

Work
?
?

Oh
,
I
forget
,
and
Helva's
voice
was
really
contrite
.

If
she
could
have
blushed
,
she
would
have
.

You
people
don't
have
adjustable
vision
.

In
a
kind
of
shock
,
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
committee
bent
to
observe
the
incredibly
copied
and
brilliantly
executed
Last
Supper
on
the
head
of
a
screw
.

Are
you
referring
,
sir
,
asked
Helva
politely
,
to
the
Dark
Age
discussions
of
the
number
of
angels
who
could
stand
on
the
head
of
a
pin
?
?

Shell
people
were
schooled
to
examine
every
aspect
of
a
problem
or
situation
before
making
a
prognosis
.

She
approached
the
problem
by
investigating
the
methods
of
sound
reproduction
through
the
centuries
,
human
and
instrumental
.

Her
own
sound
production
equipment
was
essentially
more
instrumental
than
vocal
.

Breath
control
and
the
proper
enunciation
of
vowel
sounds
within
the
oral
cavity
appeared
to
require
the
most
development
and
practice
.

Acquiring
a
repertoire
from
the
Laboratory
library
was
no
problem
to
one
trained
to
perfect
recall
.

It
was
,
to
Helva
,
only
a
matter
of
the
correct
reproduction
and
diaphragmic
control
required
by
the
music
attempted
.

If
the
authorities
remarked
on
her
curious
avocation
,
they
did
so
among
themselves
.

All
you
have
to
do
is
ask
,
he
retorted
hopefully
.

Do
you
have
anything
for
me
?
?

He
stumbled
and
fell
,
but
it
did
not
hurt
.

Mercer
spoke
to
her
.

Isn't
it
wonderful
?
?

I
am
so
happy
to
be
here
.

It
was
foolish
and
snobbish
to
wear
clothing
when
none
of
these
nice
people
did
.

He
wondered
how
anyone
could
have
the
good
luck
to
visit
a
planet
as
nice
as
this
.

The
pain
was
gone
,
though
it
had
been
crippling
the
first
time
.

Mercer
smiled
at
her
through
his
happiness
.

In
that
beautiful
place
,
among
all
those
companionable
and
attractive
people
,
he
sat
and
smiled
.

Mercer
wondered
how
long
the
super-condamine
had
lasted
him
.

Having
arrived
he
blinked
sleepily
and
friendlily
at
them
,
and
lapsed
back
into
the
restful
stupor
from
which
he
had
emerged
.

At
last
he
noticed
a
return
of
the
inwardness
of
pain
.

He
knew
all
the
events
which
could
take
place
on
Shayol
.

apparently
her
many
torsos
,
stretched
out
along
the
ground
,
had
a
greater
capacity
for
retaining
the
drug
than
did
his
body
.

Mercer
squeezed
the
man's
shoulder
.

'
A
good
morrow
to
you
,
my
boy
.

That's
out
of
a
play
.

Did
you
ever
see
a
play
?
?

Yes
,
said
Mercer
,
a
little
ashamed
of
his
obviousness
.

Soon
,
said
the
half-man
.

What's
a
'
scene
'
?
?

Is
that
the
name
for
the
needle
?
?

No
,
no
,
no
.

It
might
have
been
several
months
.

Thus
events
occurred
,
and
victims
changed
in
appearance
,
and
new
ones
arrived
.

Finally
,
Mercer
did
manage
to
follow
B'dikkat
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
.

Fighting
pleasure
itself
,
he
begged
B'dikkat
to
check
the
records
and
to
tell
him
how
long
he
had
been
there
.

B'dikkat
grudgingly
agreed
,
but
he
did
not
come
out
of
the
doorway
.

Good
luck
,
fellow
.

Was
B'dikkat
a
crazy
slave
to
his
own
duty
or
was
he
a
man
who
had
hopes
of
going
back
to
his
own
planet
some
day
,
surrounded
by
a
family
of
little
cow-people
resembling
himself
?
?

Mercer
,
despite
his
happiness
,
wept
a
little
at
the
strange
fate
of
B'dikkat
.

There
were
unclaimed
square
miles
of
seating
space
around
them
,
but
he
appreciated
the
kindliness
of
her
gesture
none
the
less
.

The
front
part
of
my
head
was
called
a
face
,
and
I
could
talk
with
it
.

He
certainly
didn't
want
a
wife
who
was
fickle
as
Ann
.

Sometimes
he
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
thinking
of
Ann
,
and
then
could
not
get
back
to
sleep
.

The
easiest
thing
would
be
to
sell
out
to
Al
Budd
and
leave
the
country
,
but
there
was
a
stubborn
streak
in
him
that
wouldn't
allow
it
.

Each
day
he
found
himself
thinking
less
often
of
Ann
;
;

Because
the
summer
was
unusually
dry
and
hot
,
the
spring
produced
a
smaller
stream
than
in
ordinary
years
.

The
grass
in
the
meadows
came
fast
,
now
that
the
warm
weather
was
here
.

When
,
in
late
afternoon
on
the
last
day
in
June
,
he
saw
two
people
top
the
ridge
to
the
south
and
walk
toward
the
house
,
he
quit
work
immediately
and
strode
to
his
rifle
.

It
could
be
some
kind
of
trick
Budd
had
thought
up
.

Morgan
watched
the
two
figures
for
a
time
,
puzzled
.

He
didn't
think
it
was
possible
for
this
couple
to
be
pretending
.

Her
eyes
were
glazed
as
if
she
didn't
hear
or
even
see
him
.

She
had
reached
a
point
at
which
she
didn't
even
care
how
she
looked
.

Her
blond
hair
was
frowzy
,
her
dress
torn
in
several
places
,
and
her
shoes
were
so
completely
worn
out
that
they
were
practically
no
protection
.

She
was
amazingly
light
,
and
so
relaxed
in
his
arms
that
he
wasn't
even
sure
she
was
conscious
.

He
put
her
down
on
the
couch
,
and
going
into
the
kitchen
,
saw
that
the
boy
had
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
the
table
.

They
looked
a
good
deal
alike
,
Morgan
thought
.

He
stood
looking
down
at
her
for
a
moment
,
wondering
what
could
have
reduced
her
to
this
condition
.

He
brought
his
Winchester
in
from
the
front
of
the
house
,
then
faced
the
boy
.

Who
are
you
and
what
happened
to
you
?
?

I
am
a
mess
,
she
said
,
and
suddenly
she
was
alarmed
.

Who
are
you
?
?

I
am
Dan
Morgan
.

You
fell
down
in
front
of
the
house
,
and
I
carried
you
in
.

I
am
sorry
,
Mr.
Morgan
.

The
grateful
way
she
looked
at
Morgan
made
him
ashamed
of
himself
.

No
,
she'll
be
all
right
,
Jones
said
quickly
.

We'll
see
,
Morgan
said
.

He
nodded
and
,
going
into
the
bedroom
,
brought
a
needle
,
thread
,
and
scissors
.

The
bed
isn't
made
,
but
you'll
find
plenty
of
blankets
there
.

You
are
awfully
kind
,
the
girl
said
.

We'll
pay
you
back
if
you'll
let
us
.

They
were
a
pair
of
lost
,
whipped
kids
,
Morgan
thought
as
he
went
to
bed
.

He
was
thinking
of
Rittenhouse
and
how
he
had
left
him
there
,
to
rock
to
death
on
the
porch
of
the
Splendide
.

Clayton
tried
to
call
back
the
face
of
the
man
he
had
known
.

Come
here
.

Gavin
slipped
his
arms
around
his
chest
and
hugged
him
fiercely
.

I
saw
you
driftin
away
--
but
I
tried
.

Laurel
is
gone
,
my
men
are
gone
,
Ed
is
dead
--
and
you
come
to
me
,
to
help
me
.

Clayton
freed
himself
from
the
embrace
and
stepped
back
.

You
get
ready

The
mare
had
backed
away
.

You
take
it
easy
,
your
time
will
come
.

I
made
you
a
man
.

He
approached
the
horse
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
stallion's
quivering
neck
.

It
was
nice
then
,
so
peaceful
and
quiet
.

There
was
no
one
but
me
.

Clayton
swung
into
the
saddle
and
whacked
the
stallion's
rump
.

The
two
horses
broke
from
the
yard
,
from
the
circle
of
light
cast
by
the
lamp
still
burning
in
the
house
,
into
the
darkness
.

Then
at
last
the
darkness
began
to
dissolve
.

Lester
heard
their
muttering
,
saw
their
eyes
reveal
their
desire
.

You
see
,
he
lied
to
us
when
he
said
he
was
leavin
alone
.

He
treats
her
like
she
was
dirt
.

And
you
stand
by
like
a
fool
and
let
him
do
it

He
remembered
Clayton's
mocking
smile
in
the
saloon
when
he
had
asked
him
what
he
would
do
if
they
brought
their
cattle
to
water
.

He
turned
to
Lester
.

He
meant
to
help
Gavin
all
the
time
.

There
are
plenty
of
fresh
horses
halfway
at
my
place
.

There's
only
one
way
they
can
get
out
now
and
that's
through
the
Gap
--
if
we
ride
hard
we
can
take
them
.

They
neither
gained
nor
fell
back
.

Gavin's
face
was
bloodless
with
excitement
.

The
land
over
which
he
sped
was
the
land
he
had
created
and
lived
in
:
his
valley
.

He
was
,
in
fact
,
showing
signs
of
reviving
.

He
had
been
carrying
an
Enfield
rifle
and
a
holstered
navy
cap-and-ball
pistol
.

But
it
at
least
offered
him
a
chance
for
living
.

Evidently
this
was
a
precaution
so
that
mounts
would
be
available
in
an
emergency
.

We'll
stampede
the
rest
.

You
stay
with
the
ladies
.

Susan
halted
Dean
and
kissed
him
.

Mike
only
said
,
Later
.

The
way
you
were
careful
?
?

Running
around
in
the
moonlight
almost
naked
and
slugging
a
man
with
a
rock
?
?

He
handed
the
bayonet
to
Dean
and
kept
the
pistol
.

Stay
well
back
of
me
,
he
said
.

Just
me
,
Mike
said
.

But
the
luck
that
had
been
running
their
way
left
him
.

The
startled
horses
began
rearing
on
their
tethers
.

No
,
but
the
fat's
in
the
fire
!
!

The
rest
of
us
can
fort
up
in
the
house
and
hang
on
until
you
get
back
.

Watch
out
for
Apaches
when
it
comes
daylight
.

Mike
made
a
dash
to
the
rear
of
the
frame
buildings
.

He
crawled
beneath
the
two
supply
wagons
which
stood
between
the
buildings
and
peered
around
a
corner
.

Shouldering
the
load
he
peered
from
the
door
.

He
set
his
bundle
down
.

Snatching
the
lantern
from
its
peg
,
he
shattered
its
globe
with
a
blow
against
a
post
.

He
turned
and
raced
across
the
parade
ground
toward
the
rock
house
.

The
stockade
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
guerrillas
sighted
him
.

One
struck
the
muzzle
of
one
of
the
rifles
that
projected
from
the
shoulder
pack
.

Guerrillas
were
racing
toward
him
.

Susan
bounced
to
her
feet
and
slammed
the
door
.

The
wagons
were
burning
fiercely
.

Gawdamighty
!
!

Many
of
them
,
in
increasing
panic
,
came
running
with
water
in
their
hats
in
a
ludicrous
effort
.

The
heat
drove
the
guerrillas
back
.

The
glow
of
the
fire
reached
through
the
openings
in
the
windows
,
giving
light
enough
to
examine
Mike's
wound
.

Keep
this
to
yourself
.

He
brushed
past
the
clergyman
and
walked
into
the
center
of
the
camp
.

Using
his
hands
as
a
trumpet
he
shouted
,
Fort
up
!
!

For
a
second
,
engages
,
cooks
,
voyageurs
appeared
struck
dumb
.

Oso
gave
me
an
unruffled
look
.

He
shook
his
head
.

He
did
that
with
all
the
Nations
.

The
War
Department
wrote
Mr.
Manuel
a
letter
and
said
he
was
a
hero
.

You
are
wrong
,
Matt
.

That's
why
this
company's
important
.

As
I
dug
in
behind
one
of
the
bales
we
were
using
as
protection
,
I
grudgingly
found
myself
agreeing
with
Oso's
logic
,
especially
when
I
imagined
what
would
have
happened
to
Missy
if
Old
Knife's
large
party
of
screeching
warriors
had
overrun
our
company
.

Still
,
I
was
disgusted
with
myself
for
agreeing
with
Montero's
methods
.

Surprisingly
,
he
had
told
the
others
what
he
had
done
.

In
the
brief
moment
I
had
to
talk
to
them
before
I
took
my
post
on
the
ring
of
defenses
,
I
indicated
I
was
sickened
by
the
methods
men
employed
to
live
and
trade
on
the
river
.

But
Oso
replied
calmly
,
Trouble
ain't
easy
to
dodge
out
in
this
country
,
rev'rend
.

He
had
ordered
the
ponies
brought
inside
the
fortified
circle
and
had
assigned
Pierre
and
a
band
of
picked
engages
the
job
of
trying
to
keep
them
steady
under
fire
.

although
we
didn't
expect
the
attack
before
dawn
,
the
long
cloudy
night
,
filled
with
the
sounds
of
the
industrious
insects
,
seemed
endless
.

Coyotes
and
hunting
wolves
sounded
like
signaling
Indian
scouts
,
the
whinny
of
a
restless
pony
made
one's
skin
crawl
.

I
didn't
catch
a
wink
.

Hold
your
fire
,
Montero
was
shouting
.

I
found
his
chest
in
my
sights
.

If
you
are
goin'
to
kill
'em
--
!
!

Kill
'em
!
!

They'll
be
back
!
!

Far
up
the
valley
I
could
see
the
Rees
circling
and
reorganizing
.

The
morning
air
was
filled
with
the
sweetish
odor
of
new-spilled
blood
,
the
acrid
stench
of
frightened
horses
,
and
the
bitterness
of
burned
powder
.

A
rifle
cracked
;
;

There
was
a
ragged
volley
.

Wait
for
the
charge
!
!

The
sharp
cries
at
the
end
of
the
valley
were
faint
.

They
grew
louder
as
the
Indians
charged
again
.

The
war
captain
had
been
badly
wounded
and
was
fighting
to
hold
his
seat
.

I
could
see
the
blood
running
down
his
chest
.

I
forgot
to
aim
.

Oso
reached
up
,
jerked
the
buck
from
the
bale
and
snapped
his
neck
.

This
time
more
of
them
hurdled
the
barrier
.

It
sounded
like
a
man
kicking
a
melon
.

His
eyes
were
dark
,
fluid
,
fearful
,
and
he
gave
a
sigh
as
my
knife
went
in
.

The
Aricaras
made
one
last
desperate
charge
.

It
was
pitiful
to
see
the
thin
ranks
of
warriors
,
old
and
young
,
wheeling
and
twisting
their
ponies
frantically
from
side
to
side
only
to
be
tumbled
bleeding
from
their
saddles
by
the
relentless
slam
,
slam
of
the
cruelly
efficient
Hawkinses
.

It
would
to
me
.

An
hour
before
,
with
the
children
asleep
and
nothing
but
the
strange
darkness
,
he
would
have
appreciated
company
.

I
own
the
place
.

It
didn't
seem
to
tell
her
anything
.

She
glanced
around
the
clearing
,
taking
in
the
wagon
and
the
load
of
supplies
and
trappings
scattered
over
the
ground
,
the
two
kids
,
the
whiteface
bull
that
was
chewing
its
cud
just
within
the
far
reaches
of
the
firelight
.

It's
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
man
would
be
proud
of
.

And
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
.

Never
mind
,
she
said
sternly
.

It
wouldn't
matter
to
my
father
,
and
not
to
me
.

I
don't
mind
washing
dishes
now
and
then
,
he
said
pleasantly
.

She
brought
the
quirt
down
,
slashing
it
across
his
cheek
,
and
he
tried
to
step
back
.

He
was
shaking
with
anger
,
his
breath
coming
in
long
,
painful
gasps
.

The
voice
came
from
behind
him
,
and
Wilson
turned
.

He
was
tall
and
dark-skinned
,
a
half-breed
,
Wilson
thought
.

I
thought
I
told
you
to
stay
home
.

The
half-breed
eased
the
Winchester
down
and
rested
it
across
his
lap
.

his
eyes
were
black
and
deep-set
,
and
expressionless
.

I
can
take
care
of
this
.

You've
got
no
business
up
here
.

The
half-breed
didn't
answer
this
time
.

He
works
for
my
father
,
the
girl
said
,
and
then
seemed
to
change
her
mind
.

It
must
have
got
there
when
you
fell
against
me
.

I'll
bet
that's
as
close
as
you've
been
to
a
man
since
you
were
a
baby
,
Wilson
said
.

I
don't
know
what
goes
on
around
here
,
and
I
don't
care
.

I
don't
know
what
makes
you
think
you
can
get
away
with
this
kind
of
business
,
and
I
don't
care
about
that
,
either
.

He
side-stepped
her
blow
and
she
fell
,
stumbling
against
the
gelding
.

He
had
known
women
like
that
,
one
woman
in
particular
.

They
expected
greater
things
from
him
,
regardless
of
how
trying
the
circumstances
,
and
they
were
disappointed
.

They
lay
a
little
too
stiffly
,
with
their
eyes
straining
to
stay
closed
.

I'll
be
down
at
the
creek
finishing
the
dishes
,
if
you
want
me
.

He
found
the
pan
where
he
had
dropped
it
and
carried
it
back
down
to
the
stream
.

The
coyote
was
calling
again
,
and
he
hoped
that
this
time
there
would
be
no
other
sounds
to
interrupt
it
.

He
had
a
feeling
that
the
girl
meant
trouble
.

Already
some
of
the
pain
had
gone
from
Amelia's
death
.

But
they
were
starting
a
new
life
.

Six
hundred
and
forty
acres
,
the
old
man
back
in
St.
Louis
had
said
;
;

good
grass
,
good
water
.

In
the
last
analysis
,
though
,
Wilson
had
little
cause
to
complain
.

It
hadn't
started
out
that
way
.

They
were
going
to
town
,
and
they
were
both
excited
.

It
was
the
only
thing
about
her
that
was
the
least
bit
hard
to
remember
.

The
first
part
of
the
road
was
steep
,
but
it
leveled
off
after
the
second
bend
and
curled
gradually
into
the
valley
.

all
dusty
and
sunbaked
.

I
was
nearly
thirty
at
the
time
.

It
was
dark
and
,
I
sensed
,
very
large
;
;

Squatting
,
as
if
waiting
.

Since
they
could
see
me
but
I
not
them
,
their
presence
in
the
hall
disturbed
me
.

The
clerk
paid
them
no
attention
.

His
job
simply
consisted
in
registering
new
men
.

He
wore
his
white
shirt
open
at
the
neck
,
revealing
a
bit
of
scrawny
pale
chest
underneath
.

It
was
obvious
that
he
wished
himself
different
from
the
sort
of
person
he
thought
he
was
.

The
morning's
tabloids
were
on
the
counter
,
and
a
stack
of
dog-eared
men's
magazines
.

On
a
shelf
in
the
office
behind
the
counter
was
a
small
radio
dialed
permanently
on
a
station
which
broadcast
only
vulgar
commercials
and
cheap
popular
music
.

He
couldn't
afford
to
have
anyone
mess
around
with
them
,
he
said
.

I
could
observe
the
two
fans
down
at
the
end
,
but
their
size
in
themselves
meant
nothing
to
me
as
long
as
I
had
no
measure
of
comparison
.

I
felt
certain
it
was
self-appointed
.

It
sprang
from
a
type
of
mentality
I'd
encountered
often
enough
but
certainly
had
not
expected
to
find
here
.

I
felt
strongly
attached
to
the
hall
,
however
,
and
hardly
a
day
passed
when
I
did
not
go
to
look
at
it
from
a
distance
.

I
wished
to
prepare
myself
but
did
not
even
know
what
sort
of
clothes
I
ought
to
be
wearing
.

Its
front
was
windowless
,
but
irregularities
in
the
masonry
might
be
an
indication
that
windows
,
now
blinded
,
had
once
looked
out
upon
the
street
.

But
it
was
not
a
tall
structure
and
other
buildings
concealed
it
.

I
could
consult
this
personage
on
any
weekday
morning
,
though
not
before
ten
o'clock
.

When
I
went
for
my
interview
with
the
director
I
saw
why
.

Cigarette
butts
littered
the
floor
.

The
staircase
itself
seemed
still
to
be
echoing
the
heavy
footfalls
of
many
men
.

I
rapped
my
knuckles
on
the
counter
.

I
was
at
once
disappointed
,
although
just
what
I
had
expected
him
to
look
like
I
could
not
have
explained
.

he
looked
dapper
in
a
lightweight
summer
suit
,
brown
silk
tie
and
green-tinted
soft
collar
.

He
did
not
look
at
them
now
.

As
he
lowered
himself
on
the
chair
behind
his
desk
I
wondered
what
this
dapper
,
slightly
ridiculous
man
could
possibly
have
to
do
with
the
workings
of
the
hall
.

Barton
caught
the
lighter
man's
shoulder
and
swung
him
around
.

The
only
reason
we
brought
you
was
to
get
Miller
out
.

What
are
you
doing
out
of
the
block
?
?

It's
Curtiss
,
he
said
,
naming
the
man
Rankin
had
hit
.

He's
having
some
kind
of
a
fit
.

Foster
had
brought
extra
clothing
also
.

I
won't
even
try
to
thank
you
.

The
ex-prison
guard
was
embarrassed
.

I
did
it
for
the
valley
.

There's
nothing
for
you
here
.

He
did
not
trust
Rankin
,
his
violent
temper
,
his
killer
instinct
.

They
were
in
a
fight
,
outweighed
in
both
numbers
and
money
.

It
was
all
right
to
put
a
bunch
of
ranchers
onto
horses
,
to
call
them
Night
Riders
,
to
set
out
to
attack
the
largest
mining
combination
the
country
had
ever
seen
if
all
they
wanted
was
adventure
.

But
if
they
really
hoped
to
succeed
they
needed
professionals
,
men
who
knew
how
to
use
a
gun
against
men
,
who
would
match
the
killers
on
the
other
side
.

Then
Barton
touched
Carl
Dill's
arm
and
moved
off
,
up
the
river
bank
.

He
too
knew
the
agony
of
going
for
weeks
,
sometimes
months
without
the
solace
of
tobacco
.

He
had
been
the
auditor
for
the
mining
syndicate
,
and
he
had
stolen
fifty
thousand
dollars
of
the
syndicate's
money
.

It
had
drawn
them
together
,
and
since
his
release
from
prison
Dill
had
worked
tirelessly
to
effect
this
night's
escape
.

He
said
now
,
I've
got
the
perfect
headquarters
set
up
.

A
company
of
cavalry
couldn't
come
in
there
if
two
men
were
guarding
that
trail
.

How
do
the
valley
people
feel
?
?

Barton
half-straightened
in
surprise
.

What's
he
doing
there
?
?

How
come
?
?

Your
sister-in-law
has
the
faro
bank
in
Cap
Ayres'
saloon
.

I
was
afraid
of
this
.

I
almost
didn't
tell
you
.

If
you
hadn't
I'd
have
killed
you
.

They'll
be
there
waiting
for
you
.

Donald
Kruger
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
hold
him
as
hostage
,
and
I
wouldn't
entrust
a
snake
to
his
tender
care
.

I've
got
to
get
the
boy
.

Barton's
men
cut
the
telegraph
wires
in
half
a
dozen
places
,
carrying
away
whole
sections
to
make
repairs
more
difficult
.

The
office
was
of
logs
,
four
rooms
,
each
heated
by
an
iron
stove
.

There
a
dozen
giant
monitors
played
their
seventy-five-foot
jets
of
water
against
the
huge
seam
of
tertiary
gravel
which
was
the
mountainside
.

A
million
dollars'
of
gold
a
month
.

Fat
showed
in
loose
rolls
beneath
the
shirt
.

Hague
squeezed
down
his
uneasy
dislike
.

We
want
him
back
there
or
we
want
him
dead
.

If
she
sensed
any
unusual
preoccupation
on
the
part
of
her
mother
,
she
did
not
comment
upon
it
.

She
had
offered
to
walk
,
but
Pamela
knew
she
would
not
feel
comfortable
about
her
child
until
she
had
personally
confided
her
to
the
care
of
the
little
pink
woman
who
chose
to
be
called
Auntie
.

All
of
her
movements
were
careful
and
methodical
,
partaking
of
the
stealth
of
a
criminal
who
has
plotted
his
felony
for
months
in
advance
and
knows
exactly
which
step
to
take
next
in
the
course
of
the
final
execution
of
his
crime
.

On
her
bureau
lay
a
small
,
brass
ornament
of
simple
design
and
faded
engraving
--
an
object
which
,
Pamela
believed
now
,
had
been
the
property
of
her
great-grandfather
,
Major
Hiram
Munroe
Culver
.

He
had
belonged
to
this
land
and
,
perhaps
,
had
desecrated
it
--
and
this
was
the
only
material
symbol
that
remained
of
him
.

Perhaps
it
was
insane
,
Pamela
thought
.

She
remembered
little
of
her
previous
journey
there
with
Grace
,
and
she
could
but
hope
that
her
dedication
to
her
mission
would
enable
her
to
accomplish
it
.

The
slight
flutter
that
had
disturbed
the
motion
of
her
heart
when
she
entered
the
forest
was
gone
now
,
and
even
the
dim
groves
of
trees
through
which
she
occasionally
passed
did
not
reawaken
her
fear
.

Having
persisted
too
long
in
deliberate
ignorance
and
denial
of
the
forces
that
threatened
her
,
Pamela
was
relieved
now
to
admit
their
potency
and
to
be
taking
definite
steps
toward
grappling
with
them
.

today
,
on
the
contrary
,
it
seemed
utterly
reasonable
.

Unconcerned
,
indifferent
,
unmotivated
,
the
forest
was
simply
there
--
fighting
man's
depredations
with
more
abundant
growth
and
man's
follies
with
its
own
musical
evening
laughter
.

In
her
grim
pursuit
of
tranquillity
,
Pamela
focused
her
thoughts
on
her
husband
.

She
was
sure
she
would
reach
the
pool
by
climbing
,
and
she
clung
to
that
belief
despite
the
increasing
number
of
obstacles
.

The
forest
had
become
an
alien
world
where
she
strove
,
alone
,
unprotected
,
unguided
,
to
deal
with
whatever
hindrances
were
offered
.

Silence
came
into
the
forest
--
a
solid
being
that
clapped
its
hand
over
the
murmuring
mouths
of
the
birds
and
the
whispered
comfort
of
the
trees
.

She
stumbled
over
the
root
of
a
tree
that
protruded
maliciously
above
the
earth
.

The
trees
were
crowded
so
closely
together
that
their
branches
overlapped
,
virtually
shutting
out
the
sun
completely
.

The
earth
smelled
moist
and
pungent
as
it
might
in
a
cave
deprived
of
the
cleansing
effect
of
the
sun's
rays
.

Where
before
had
she
felt
or
dreamt
or
imagined
such
a
scene
?
?

But
she
did
not
know
which
way
to
go
.

Her
own
body
protested
,
aching
painfully
where
the
blood
in
her
veins
had
congealed
,
where
cold
demon
wisps
still
clung
and
caressed
.

tree
branches
snapped
as
she
pushed
them
ruthlessly
away
from
her
.

She
began
it
deliberately
,
so
that
none
of
her
words
would
be
lost
on
him
.

Beaming
idiotically
,
he
pooched
out
his
lips
and
attempted
to
kiss
her
.

Do
you
hear
me
?
?

You
are
going
to
listen
!
!

I
think
you
stink
,
Tom
Lord
!
!

I
think
you
are
mean
and
hateful
and
stupid
,
and
--
louder
?
?

Looks
like
we
might
be
in
for
a
speck
of
trouble
.

He
grinned
,
nodded
,
and
walked
around
to
the
front
of
the
car
.

If
I
could
make
myself
feel
the
same
way

He
wasn't
a
big
man
;
;

rather
on
the
medium
side
.

This
ain't
your
brand
,
maybe
,
Lord
suggested
.

Might
get
there
faster
walkin'
,
Lord
drawled
,
seein'
as
how
I
got
a
busted
front
spring
.

Lord
laughed
with
secret
amusement
.

He
pointed
,
cutting
her
off
.

And
even
with
her
limited
knowledge
of
such
things
,
she
knew
that
the
car
could
be
repaired
there
;
;

sufficiently
,
at
least
,
to
get
them
back
into
town
.

Otherwise
,
she
would
be
baited
into
a
tantrum
--
teased
and
provoked
until
she
lost
control
of
herself
,
and
thus
lost
still
another
battle
in
the
maddening
struggle
of
Tom
Lord
Vs.
Joyce
Lakewood
.

It
poured
out
of
him
like
an
electric
current
,
a
feeling
that
the
muscles
and
nerves
of
his
fine-drawn
body
were
coiling
for
action
,
and
that
that
action
would
be
all
that
he
anticipated
.

Joyce
had
seen
him
like
this
once
before
--
more
than
once
,
actually
,
but
on
one
particularly
memorable
occasion
.

McBride
gave
him
his
opportunity
when
he
showed
up
in
town
with
a
pistol
on
his
hip
.

The
trouble
was
that
he
had
virtually
had
to
protest
.

Why
single
me
out
on
this
permit
deal
?
?

He
was
an
honest
man
doing
a
hard
job
,
and
the
implication
that
he
was
anything
else
was
unbearable
.

You
think
that
Highlands
swindled
you
and
I
helped
'em
do
it
.

I
just
do
what
I
am
told
,
and
--

An'
that
could
mean
trouble
with
a
fella
that's
workin'
for
crooks
.

I'll
get
around
to
it
a
little
later
,
he
mumbled
desperately
.

He
flung
off
Lord's
hand
and
attempted
to
push
past
him
,
inadvertently
shoving
him
into
a
storefront
.

And
he
could
no
longer
think
of
face-saving
,
of
honor
,
but
only
of
escape
.

he
was
long
past
the
point
of
coherent
thinking
.

laughing
at
a
dying
man
,
laughing
as
a
man
was
beaten
to
death
.

Billie
had
unhitched
the
mules
from
both
Tom
Brannon's
and
his
father's
wagon
.

Conchita
nagged
at
the
younger
children
,
attempting
without
success
to
keep
her
thoughts
off
Tom
Brannon
.

She
wished
that
she
could
talk
to
her
mother
about
it
.

Even
as
she
called
to
the
children
,
Conchita
let
her
gaze
seek
Tom
Brannon
.

After
all
,
you
want
the
senora
as
much
as
you
want
the
boy
.

She
won't
change
her
mind
,
Brannon
said
.

A
year
,
Luis
?
?

In
a
year
she'll
like
living
in
Clayton's
house
too
much
to
come
back
to
me
,
Brannon
said
flatly
.

But
to
take
him
and
leave
his
mother
behind
is
not
good
.

Where
I
go
,
she
goes
--
and
the
kids
with
us
.

If
you
take
the
one
,
you'd
better
take
both
.

They
were
silent
for
a
little
while
,
each
looking
glum
.

I
am
with
you
,
of
course
,
Tomas
.

All
right
,
Brannon
said
,
rising
.

Brannon
timed
it
so
that
they
rode
in
an
hour
after
nightfall
.

They
had
for
cover
both
darkness
and
a
summer
storm
.

Those
who
had
slickers
donned
them
.

There
was
to
be
no
gunplay
.

If
the
bluff
failed
and
they
ran
into
trouble
,
Brannon
had
told
the
others
,
they
would
withdraw
--
and
he
would
come
after
his
son
another
time
.

The
Ramirez
brothers
were
also
along
.

Also
because
of
the
storm
,
the
streets
of
Rockfork
were
deserted
.

Hogan
got
down
from
the
saddle
and
had
a
look
inside
.

He
and
Hogan
waited
by
the
door
,
one
to
either
side
.

Macklin
was
the
third
man
to
come
out
,
and
he
came
unhurriedly
.

He
was
puffing
on
a
cigar
,
and
he
was
turning
up
his
coat
collar
against
the
rain
.

Just
come
along
,
Brannon
told
him
.

Don't
start
anything
you
can't
finish
.

We'll
talk
over
at
your
office
.

I'll
remember
you
,
he
said
.

Don't
press
your
luck
,
badge-toter
.

Brannon
said
,
Now
the
key
to
the
lockup
,
Marshal
.

What
for
?
?

Get
it
out
!
!

Damned
if
I
will
.

Resignedly
,
Macklin
turned
to
the
back
door
.

The
door
of
the
lockup
was
of
oak
planks
and
banded
with
strap
iron
.

They
crowded
him
in
that
threatening
way
once
more
,
forced
him
to
give
in
.

They
returned
to
the
street
,
mounted
their
horses
,
rode
through
the
rain
to
the
big
house
on
Houston
Street
.

Deputy
Marshal
Luke
Harper
still
stood
guard
on
the
veranda
,
a
forlorn
,
scarecrowish
figure
in
the
murky
dark
.

Don't
get
yourself
killed
for
something
that
doesn't
concern
you
.

They
brought
to
it
all
the
odors
that
clung
to
men
like
themselves
,
that
of
their
own
sweat
,
of
campfire
smoke
,
of
horses
and
cattle
.

The
author
of
the
anonymous
notes
seemed
to
be
all-knowing
.

But
the
day
of
the
deadline
came
and
passed
,
and
the
men
who
had
scoffed
at
the
warnings
laughed
with
satisfaction
.

For
,
with
a
single
exception
,
nothing
had
happened
to
them
.

After
walking
out
to
his
corral
that
morning
,
he'd
been
amazed
to
see
the
dust
puff
up
in
front
of
his
feet
.

A
split
second
later
,
the
distant
crack
of
a
rifle
had
sounded
.

But
he
had
found
all
of
the
thickets
and
points
of
cover
deserted
.

He
hadn't
even
pretended
to
be
farming
his
spread
.

William
Lewis
made
the
rounds
of
all
who
lived
near
him
again
,
that
August
morning
after
a
bullet
landed
at
his
feet
,
and
once
more
he
accused
and
threatened
everyone
.

I'll
be
ready
next
time
!
!

He
found
nothing
,
but
he
still
refused
to
give
up
and
move
out
.

A
bullet
smashed
directly
into
the
center
of
William
Lewis'
chest
.

Two
more
shots
followed
in
quick
succession
,
dropping
him
limp
and
huddled
on
the
ground
.

It
took
some
time
to
locate
Horn
.

He
immediately
rode
on
to
Cheyenne
,
threw
a
ten-day
drinking
spree
and
dropped
some
very
strong
hints
among
friends
.

The
company
herds
were
being
raided
less
often
,
and
cabins
and
soddies
all
over
the
range
were
standing
deserted
.

Everyone
knew
it
,
but
he
sort
of
acted
like
he
didn't
care
who
knew
it
--
even
after
them
notes
came
,
even
after
he'd
heard
about
Lewis
,
even
after
he'd
been
shot
at
a
couple
o'
times
hisself
!
!

Harnessing
a
team
to
a
buckboard
,
they
drove
out
to
a
willow-lined
creek
about
a
half-mile
off
,
then
climbed
down
and
began
chopping
.

He
looked
around
in
surprise
,
then
noticed
that
Fred
Powell
was
clutching
his
chest
.

The
hired
man
ran
over
to
help
his
boss
.

Exterminatin'
cow
thieves
is
just
a
business
proposition
with
me
,
he'd
blandly
announce
.

I
seen
a
lot
o'
things
in
my
time
.

After
the
first
two
murders
,
the
warning
notes
were
rarely
ignored
.

If
you
don't
leave
this
country
within
3
days
,
your
life
will
be
taken
the
same
as
Powell's
was
.

This
was
the
message
found
tacked
to
the
cabin
door
.

All
through
Albany
and
Laramie
counties
,
other
men
were
doing
the
same
.

It
is
also
possible
,
but
equally
doubtful
,
that
he
actually
shot
down
the
hundreds
of
men
with
which
his
legend
credits
him
.

(
The
best
evidence
is
that
he
received
a
monthly
wage
of
about
$125
,
very
good
money
in
an
era
when
top
hands
worked
for
$30
and
found
.

He
evidently
couldn't
foresee
that
it
might
be
his
downfall
in
the
end
.

He
had
made
himself
the
personification
of
the
Devil
to
the
homesteaders
.

I
am
sure
you
won't
mind
doing
me
a
small
favor
.

Tell
her
Curt
Adams
wants
to
see
her
.

Summers
pulled
up
short
,
and
turned
around
.

Brenner
continued
to
smile
,
but
his
eyes
were
cold
.

He
turned
and
looked
around
at
the
lobby
as
though
seeing
things
he
hadn't
before
noticed
.

Eagle's
Nest
ought
to
have
a
fire
company
.

He
started
toward
the
stairway
,
then
turned
to
add
,
Tell
her
to
come
to
Adams's
room
,
that
Adams
is
in
trouble
.

The
fact
that
Jess's
horse
had
not
been
returned
to
its
stall
could
indicate
that
Diane's
information
had
been
wrong
,
but
Curt
didn't
interpret
it
this
way
.

From
the
back
of
the
barn
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
reach
Black's
house
without
using
the
street
.

He
moved
ahead
carefully
,
his
left
hand
in
front
of
him
,
and
came
to
a
wooden
partition
.

Horse
smell
was
very
strong
,
and
he
could
hear
the
crunch
of
grain
being
ground
between
strong
jaws
.

Reaching
across
the
side
of
the
stall
,
he
slapped
the
buckskin
on
the
rump
.

The
startled
animal
let
out
a
terrified
squeal
and
thrashed
around
in
the
stall
.

He
slapped
the
buckskin
again
and
it
kicked
wildly
,
its
hoofs
rattling
the
side
of
the
stall
.

Jess
cursed
again
,
and
entered
the
barn
.

A
match
flared
,
and
he
reached
above
his
head
to
light
a
lantern
which
hung
from
a
wire
loop
.

Jess
caught
his
breath
in
surprise
.

He
started
to
reach
for
his
gun
,
but
apparently
thought
better
of
it
.

You
and
I
have
a
little
talking
to
do
,
Jess
.

He
moved
up
and
lifted
Jess's
pistol
out
of
its
holster
.

Damn
you
,
Adams
--
Jess
was
beginning
to
recover
from
his
initial
shock
.

There
was
raw
fury
in
his
eyes
,
and
the
veins
of
his
neck
were
swollen
.

Pistol-whipping
an
unarmed
man
might
come
easy
to
someone
like
Jess
,
but
Curt
couldn't
bring
himself
to
do
it
.

He
retreated
a
step
and
holstered
his
own
.

Sweat
bubbled
out
on
Jess's
swarthy
face
.

I
ain't
drawin'
against
you
,
Jess
said
thickly
.

I
heard
how
you
outdrew
Chico
.

I
just
wanted
to
hear
you
say
so
.

He
dropped
his
own
beside
it
.

so
the
pitchfork
whistled
over
Curt's
head
.

When
his
head
came
down
,
Curt
grabbed
him
by
the
hair
and
catapulted
him
head
first
into
the
wall
.

Even
Black's
old
crowbait
began
to
snort
,
and
from
the
house
Black
yelled
,
Jess
!
!

Tell
me
about
Arbuckle
!
!

Leaving
Jess's
where
it
lay
,
he
left
the
stall
.

Get
up
,
Crouch
.

Curt
opened
the
door
,
grabbed
Black
by
the
shoulder
,
and
pulled
him
into
the
barn
.

Jess
stumbled
through
the
door
.

We
are
going
to
Marshal
Woods's
house
.

Somebody
in
this
town
must
still
have
some
backbone
.

Honey
,
he
whispered
.

What
a
spectacle
he
was
,
caked
with
dirt
and
sweat
and
blood
,
filthy
as
a
pig
and
naked
as
an
Indian
,
kissing
the
finest
,
the
sweetest
,
the
bravest
,
and
absolutely
the
prettiest
girl
in
this
whole
wonderful
world
.

Got
a
lot
to
tend
to
,
but
I'll
get
back
quick
as
I
can
,
he
assured
her
.

He
stooped
,
picked
up
his
ruined
hat
,
and
pursed
his
lips
thoughtfully
.

Me
and
you's
trading
hats
so's
you'll
have
something
permanent
to
remember
me
by
!
!

Slipping
her
hand
in
his
,
they
silently
watched
the
Burnsides
make
the
bend
in
the
road
and
disappear
from
sight
.

And
now
she
could
see
him
,
looking
uncommon
handsome
,
standing
there
beside
Sally
Jackson
and
her
folks
in
front
of
their
trail-worn
wagon
.

But
even
a
reunion
as
joyous
as
this
one
did
not
make
a
break
in
the
routines
of
the
day
.

Then
,
and
only
then
,
with
the
Jacksons
and
Dan
as
their
true
guests
of
honor
,
did
the
Harrows
take
time
to
catch
up
on
the
news
.

Even
Sally
,
in
spite
of
her
gaiety
and
obvious
welcome
,
followed
the
old
taboo
of
quitting
the
gab
when
wearing
the
nosebag
.

After
their
supper
,
the
evening
turned
into
a
regular
Hoe-Down
.

Nor
Methodists
,
neither
,
she
replied
.

He
looked
down
at
his
big
hands
and
slowly
flexed
his
long
fingers
.

Don't
reckon
there's
nobody
out
there
,
'cept
maybe
Dan
,
who
can
outgrip
me
,
Harmony
.

She
was
glad
,
completely
and
unselfishly
glad
,
to
see
that
things
were
working
out
the
right
way
for
both
Sally
and
Dan
.

But
she
couldn't
,
not
yet
.

Even
strange
names
seemed
to
make
them
feel
closer
to
some
kind
of
civilization
when
stumbled
across
out
here
in
this
wilderness
.

Soon
she
saw
Rod
and
Hez
moving
over
to
join
them
.

No
sooner
were
they
through
and
the
guards
posted
,
than
the
whole
camp
turned
in
for
a
night
of
sound
sleep
.

Even
the
knowledge
that
she
was
losing
another
boy
,
as
a
mother
always
does
when
a
marriage
is
made
,
did
not
prevent
her
from
having
the
first
carefree
,
dreamless
sleep
that
she
had
known
since
they
dropped
down
the
canyon
and
into
Bear
Valley
,
way
,
way
back
there
when
they
were
crossing
those
other
mountains
.

Next
morning
,
they
moved
on
again
.

The
two
tall
brothers
waited
silently
while
their
mother
handed
Gran
her
cold
snack
and
water
jug
,
placed
the
chamber
pot
beside
her
feet
,
and
returned
to
her
place
at
the
front
of
the
wagon
with
Alice
.

Rheumatics
worse
,
Pa
?
?

But
the
sun'll
fry
it
out'n
me
onct
we
git
to
rolling
.

The
three
men
stepped
out
to
the
side
to
wait
for
Captain
Clemens'
signal
.

Hez
looked
up
at
the
high
face
of
Emigrant
Rock
,
official
signboard
for
the
Raft
River
turnoff
,
and
gloated
,
Seems
funny
that
them
Burnsides
never
took
time
to
leave
their
John-Henry
up
thar
.

Jackson
recruited
his
critters
,
and
him
and
me
fixed
up
his
wagon
while
we
was
waiting
for
you
to
catch
up
.

He's
got
the
tightest
running
gear
in
the
train
now
.

Captain
Clemens'
signal
shot
sent
the
men
hurrying
to
their
waiting
teams
.

Reckon
ye
are
right
,
Dan
,
Hez
called
back
over
his
shoulder
.

Rod
looked
apprehensively
ahead
at
the
narrowing
,
precipice-walled
gorge
.

Although
they
were
forced
to
maintain
a
sharper
watch
,
this
activity
enabled
them
to
ride
in
and
rack
their
broncs
without
any
particular
attention
being
paid
them
.

Gyp'll
be
holdin'
forth
in
some
bar
if
he's
here
at
all
,
Cobb
declared
,
glancing
along
the
street
as
they
stretched
their
legs
.

There
were
no
less
than
six
or
seven
saloons
in
Ganado
,
not
counting
the
lower
class
dives
,
all
vying
for
the
trade
of
celebrating
miners
and
teamsters
.

Separating
,
they
took
different
sides
of
the
main
drag
and
systematically
combed
the
bars
.

Russ
ran
up
the
steps
quickly
to
the
plank
porch
.

Heading
for
the
batwings
,
Cobb
glanced
perfunctorily
through
the
nearest
window
,
and
suddenly
dodged
aside
.

Fierce
anger
surged
through
Russ
.

He's
there
,
he
got
out
tersely
,
curbing
his
rising
excitement
.

Hitching
his
cartridge
belt
around
,
Pat
glanced
upward
briefly
at
the
Palace
and
started
that
way
with
Cobb
at
his
side
.

While
five
minutes
ago
the
place
had
presented
a
scene
of
easy
revelry
,
with
Gyp
Carmer
a
prominent
figure
,
it
was
now
as
somnolent
and
dull
as
the
day
before
payday
.

Where
yuh
goin'
?
?

Halting
,
Pat
turned
to
survey
him
deliberately
.

Pat
moved
into
it
.

Small
rooms
,
probably
for
cards
,
opened
off
on
either
side
.

Pat
saw
Gyp
Carmer
staggering
forward
,
a
half-filled
bottle
upraised
as
if
to
strike
.

But
he
was
more
than
half-drunk
,
and
his
faculties
were
dulled
.

Cobb
unleashed
a
single
powerful
jab
that
sent
Gyp
reeling
wildly
and
crashing
down
with
a
whining
groan
.

Kneeling
,
Cobb
planted
a
sturdy
knee
in
the
small
of
his
back
,
holding
him
pinned
.

I've
drawn
his
fangs
,
he
snapped
.

That
is
,
if
we
can
be
sure
this
is
Colcord's
money
--

Where
else
would
he
get
it
?
?

Handing
the
money
over
,
Russ
wiped
his
hands
on
his
pants-legs
as
if
ridding
himself
of
something
unclean
.

His
glance
at
Gyp
Carmer
was
disdainful
.

Shall
we
get
out
of
here
?
?

He
and
Cobb
clattered
down
the
high
steps
to
the
street
.

Pat
paused
there
,
looking
across
at
the
young
fellow
.

But
I
still
think
Penny's
an
awful
nice
girl
,
Russ
--

At
the
first
restaurant
he
sensibly
pulled
up
to
go
in
for
his
dinner
,
and
as
a
consequence
did
not
see
Cobb
strike
the
open
range
at
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
and
head
straight
across
the
swells
for
Antler
.

Over
and
above
that
,
however
,
was
his
growing
suspicion
of
Chuck
Stober's
part
in
recent
events
.

So
far
as
he
knew
,
only
his
father
could
be
there
.

His
first
glimpse
of
the
ranch
house
across
the
brushy
swells
told
him
nothing
.

He
knew
now
what
he
was
up
against
.

If
he
wondered
whether
the
attackers
would
allow
him
to
pull
away
unmolested
,
he
had
his
answer
a
moment
later
.

He
ain't
gone
far
!
!

The
would-be
assassin
had
his
position
figured
pretty
close
.

Toward
the
west
this
depression
led
toward
a
draw
.

He
had
been
sighted
,
and
his
attacker
pumping
shot
after
shot
.

The
long
minute
before
he
reached
effective
cover
seemed
endless
.

Fleischman
with
eight
was
to
patrol
the
Leyte
Gulf
area
,
with
his
main
task
to
get
any
kamikaze
before
they
got
to
the
ships
.

It
was
a
rough
long
ride
through
the
mud
and
pot
holes
.

The
truck
dropped
them
off
at
the
various
revetments
spread
through
the
jungle
.

Don't
you
worry
,
chief
,
Greg
replied
,
wondering
if
he
himself
believed
it
.

From
the
time
the
chocks
were
pulled
until
the
plane
was
out
of
sight
,
he
knew
Donovan
would
keep
his
back
to
the
strip
.

He
dropped
down
to
five
hundred
feet
,
swinging
a
little
north
of
the
city
of
Tacloban
,
and
punched
into
the
opening
that
showed
against
the
mountain
.

The
ceiling
stayed
solid
above
them
at
about
eight
hundred
feet
,
and
at
times
the
sheer
cliffs
seemed
about
to
close
in
.

He
was
about
to
make
a
gas
check
on
his
flight
when
Todman's
voice
broke
in
:
Sweeneys
!
!

Todman
said
excitedly
,
and
hopefully
.

If
it
were
the
enemy
,
tactically
his
position
was
correct
.

But
it
also
made
him
conspicuous
to
the
enemy
,
if
it
was
the
enemy
,
and
he
hadn't
been
spotted
already
.

But
the
closing
aircraft
showed
no
sign
of
deviating
from
their
original
course
.

He
pushed
the
radio
button
.

The
planes
,
light
with
most
of
the
gas
burned
out
,
responded
beautifully
.

Greg
wished
the
Air
Corps
had
continued
to
camouflage
planes
.

Greg
slapped
his
hand
across
the
switches
that
turned
on
the
guns
and
gun
camera
and
gun
sight
.

If
the
turn
was
too
tight
,
a
barrel
roll
would
bring
them
out
.

Six
red
lines
etched
their
way
into
the
gray
and
vanished
.

As
if
drawn
by
a
wire
the
enemy
flew
into
them
.

A
large
piece
of
engine
cowling
vanished
.

If
he
spun
out
now
,
he
would
join
his
opponent
on
the
ground
.

Sweat
popped
out
over
him
and
he
felt
the
slick
between
his
palm
and
the
stick
grip
.

Cool
air
moving
slowly
through
the
open
or
smashed-out
side
windows
hinted
of
blooming
roadside
vegetation
,
and
occasionally
a
faint
fragrance
of
perfume
swirled
from
the
back
seat
.

Adios
,
I
said
,
exhausting
my
Spanish
vocabulary
on
my
host
and
exchanging
one
of
a
scarcely-tapped
store
of
smiles
with
my
host's
daughters
.

gauche
rainbow
shapes
replaced
the
poignant
ovals
of
gold
.

Just
as
I
straightened
up
with
my
duffel
bag
,
I
heard
:
Sahjunt
Yoorick
,
meet
Mrs.
Major
J.
A.
Roebuck
.

I
let
up
on
the
accelerator
,
only
to
gradually
reach
again
the
60
m.p.h.
which
would
,
I
hoped
,
overhaul
Herry
and
the
blonde
,
and
as
there
were
cars
whose
drivers
apparently
had
something
more
important
to
catch
than
had
I
,
Mrs.
Major
Roebuck
settled
down
to
practicing
on
Corporal
Johnson
the
kittenish
wiles
she
would
need
when
making
her
duty
call
on
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Somebody
in
Sante
Fe
.

Johnson
never
would
have
believed
she
had
a
son
that
age
.

No
,
I
don't
,
Johnson
said
.

I
am
a
good
Baptist
,
and
drinking

Hardly
had
Mrs.
Roebuck
driven
off
when
a
rusty
pick-up
truck
,
father
or
grandfather
of
Senor
Moriarty's
Ford
sedan
,
came
screeching
to
a
dust-swirling
stop
,
and
a
brown
face
appeared
,
its
nose
threatened
by
shards
of
what
had
once
been
the
side
window
.

Quickly
but
carefully
lowering
my
duffel
bag
over
the
low
side-rack
,
I
stepped
on
the
running
board
;
;

Maybe
I
would
beat
old
Herry
to
Siberia
after
all
.

Did
an
anteater
want
ants
?
?

We
were
in
a
field
,
in
a
tight
,
screeching
turn
.

Prairie
dogs
were
popping
up
and
popping
down
.

Tee-wah
,
the
driver
cackled
,
his
black
eyes
glittering
behind
dull
silver
chicken
fencing
.

That
was
Tee-wah
I
was
talking
.

Hell
,
that's
all
right
,
buddy
,
the
Indian
(
I
now
guessed
)
said
.

No
sooner
had
I
started
drinking
than
the
driver
started
zigzagging
the
truck
.

Suddenly
the
Spanish
became
an
English
in
which
only
one
word
emerged
with
clarity
and
precision
,
son
of
a
bitch
,
sometimes
hyphenated
by
vicious
jabs
of
a
beer
bottle
into
Johnson's
quivering
ribs
.

the
car's
far
windshield
panel
turned
into
a
silver
web
with
a
dark
hole
in
the
center
.

But
the
Indian
was
jabbing
another
bottle
toward
Johnson
.

And
what
eyes
they
were
.

I
said
,
Do
we
know
each
other
,
Miss
?
?

She
stood
up
,
pulled
the
coat
from
her
shoulders
and
started
to
slide
it
off
,
then
let
out
a
high-pitched
scream
and
I
let
out
a
low-pitched
,
wobbling
sound
like
a
muffler
blowing
out
.

I
forgive
--

I
mean
,
surely
we've
--

Ah
,
you
were
splendid
.

That
was
a
fun
one
.

It
was
fun
for
me
,
all
right
.

I
mean
:
Is
advertising
honest
?
?

I
never
wear
anything
at
all
.

They'd
peddled
the
soap
virtually
alone
,
and
without
much
success
,
until
about
a
year
ago
,
when
--
with
the
addition
of
SX-21
to
their
secret
formula
and
the
inauguration
of
a
high-powered
advertising
campaign
--
sales
had
soared
practically
into
orbit
.

The
finished
--
and
drastically
cut
--
product
would
begin
with
a
hazy
longshot
of
Joyce
entering
the
suds
,
then
bursting
above
the
pool's
surface
clad
in
layers
of
lavender
lather
,
and
I
had
a
hunch
this
item
was
going
to
sell
tons
and
tons
of
soap
;
;

Joyce
went
on
,
When
we'd
finished
,
Lou
--
Mr.
Thor
--
asked
me
to
stay
a
little
longer
.

A
man
was
holding
onto
Lou
,
holding
him
up
.

She
realized
I'd
have
to
notify
the
police
,
but
fervently
hoped
I
could
avoid
mentioning
her
name
.

The
commercials
have
just
been
for
money
,
there
hasn't
been
any
real
incentive
for
me
to
do
them
,
but
in
Underwater
Western
Eye
I'd
have
a
chance
to
act
.

I
could
show
what
I
can
do
.

You
might
as
well
wait
here
while
I
am
gone
,
so
you
can
use
my
shower
if
you'd
like
.

I
shook
my
head
.

Well
,
goodbye
,
I
said
.

Don't
hurry
too
much
.

But
suddenly
those
hot-honey
eyes
seemed
to
have
everything
but
swarms
of
bees
in
them
.

I
spun
about
and
clattered
through
the
front
room
to
the
door
.

She
wouldn't
be
taking
a
cold
shower
.

Hell
,
she
couldn't
.

But
the
scene
was
not
the
quiet
,
calm
scene
I'd
expected
.

How'd
you
hear
about
this
one
?
?

He
didn't
push
it
;
;

They
were
supposed
to
meet
Thor
at
nine
PM
for
a
conference
concerning
the
ad
campaign
for
their
soap
,
a
new
angle
based
on
this
SX-21
stuff
.

What
is
the
gunk
?
?

I
worked
for
my
Uncle
(
an
Uncle
by
marriage
so
you
will
not
think
this
has
a
mild
undercurrent
of
incest
)
who
ran
one
of
those
antique
shops
in
New
Orleans'
Vieux
Carre
,
the
old
French
Quarter
.

The
arrangement
I
had
with
him
was
to
work
four
hours
a
day
.

I
had
come
to
New
Orleans
two
years
earlier
after
graduating
college
,
partly
because
I
loved
the
city
and
partly
because
there
was
quite
a
noted
art
colony
there
.

I
loved
the
city
and
I
particularly
loved
the
gaiety
and
spirit
of
Mardi
Gras
.

the
calf
was
magnificent
,
the
ankle
perfect
.

When
she
appeared
at
the
store
to
help
out
for
a
few
hours
even
my
looking
at
her
was
surreptitious
lest
my
Uncle
notice
it
.

I
felt
that
her
eyes
were
undressing
me
as
if
she
were
a
painter
and
I
a
nude
model
.

The
cavernous
depth
,
cluttered
with
antiques
,
echoed
to
her
hard
heels
as
she
walked
directly
to
the
office
in
the
rear
and
took
the
seat
at
his
desk
.

Her
mouth
,
which
had
been
so
much
in
my
thoughts
,
was
warm
and
moist
and
tender
.

He
will
not
always
be
indisposed
.

I
don't
know
,
she
said
.

I
know
what
we
can
do
,
I
said
.

By
telling
him
you
are
making
passes
at
me
?
?

But
you
--
she
began
.

It
will
turn
out
all
right
.

No
,
I
chuckled
,
I
am
just
beginning
to
collect
dividends
on
my
investment
in
education
.

I
felt
that
he
looked
at
me
coldly
and
appraisingly
and
seemed
to
be
uncertain
what
his
attitude
towards
me
should
be
,
but
he
did
not
say
one
word
which
might
indicate
that
he
had
been
told
of
advances
to
his
wife
.

I
quit
work
at
my
usual
hour
as
if
this
day
was
no
different
from
other
days
.

A
few
minutes
later
I
saw
my
Uncle's
car
drive
up
and
a
woman's
figure
emerge
and
walk
to
the
corner
.

If
it
were
not
that
I
knew
who
it
was
I
could
have
mistaken
it
for
my
Aunt
so
well
did
her
clothes
fit
him
.

In
one
hand
he
gripped
firmly
a
parasol
though
there
had
been
no
indication
of
rain
.

He
had
better
write
a
postcard
to
Walter
.

A
card
to
Walter
would
get
him
an
introduction
to
this
Meredith
,
and
that
might
be
good
for
something
.

Nicolas
called
on
his
muse
,
a
line
came
back
:

And
indeed
,
his
postcard
did
draw
from
Walter
a
letter
recommending
his
friend
,
the
poet
Nicolas
Manas
,
to
his
friend
Meredith
Wilder
.

The
voice
crying
in
him
was
the
voice
of
guilt
.

He
had
returned
to
the
pension
a
week
ago
.

Should
she
wake
him
?
?

He
had
always
known
how
to
find
a
bed
,
and
on
his
own
terms
.

She
was
telling
herself
that
this
might
just
be
her
reward
at
the
end
of
a
long
meaningful
search
for
truth
.

That
long
night
with
Nicolas
and
marijuana
in
Venice
had
opened
her
eyes
.

Should
she
wake
him
?
?

Twenty
minutes
later
she
was
at
the
desk
of
the
Grafin's
pension
,
her
tears
dried
,
signing
a
hotel
form
and
asking
for
a
bath
.

She
had
retreated
to
this
world
.

And
then
we
shall
see
.

You
shall
see
her
at
dinner
.

In
the
small
gallery
used
as
the
guests'
dining
room
,
Meredith
sat
down
at
his
place
and
,
as
always
,
began
teasing
the
young
waitress
.

Mary
Jane
had
made
very
little
effort
.

She
had
touched
her
face
,
truly
a
noble
and
pure
face
,
only
with
a
lip
salve
which
made
her
lips
glisten
but
no
redder
than
usual
.

It
tastes
a
little
like
poppyseed
.

Steinhager
She
whispered
Steinhager
to
herself
,
several
times
,
memorizing
it
.

Meredith's
voice
was
always
deep
,
with
rough
bass
notes
in
it
;
;

She
repeated
Eurydice
.

For
three
days
,
their
stolid
oxen
had
plodded
up
a
blazing
valley
as
flat
and
featureless
as
a
dead
sea
.

As
cheerfully
as
possible
,
he
said
,
Well
,
I
guess
we
could
all
do
with
a
little
drink
.

Thank
the
Lord
,
they
still
had
water
!
!

She
took
it
grudgingly
,
her
dark
eyes
baleful
as
they
met
his
.

She
set
the
dipper
on
the
edge
of
the
deck
,
leaving
it
for
him
to
stretch
after
it
while
she
looked
on
scornfully
.

What
happens
when
there's
no
more
water
?
?

He
tilted
his
homely
face
toward
the
dry
bed
of
the
river
.

Or
do
you
want
to
see
if
I
can
stand
fever
,
too
?
?

We
can
boil
it
,
he
said
.

Hettie
,
he
said
as
gently
as
he
could
,
we
are
still
headed
west
.

Maybe
in
time
to
make
a
cross
and
dig
our
graves
.

His
wide
mouth
compressed
.

It
had
been
a
mistake
,
but
anything
would
have
been
a
mistake
,
as
it
turned
out
.

It
wasn't
the
roughness
and
crudity
and
discomfort
of
the
trip
that
had
frightened
her
.

The
bitterness
of
their
wedding
night
still
ripped
within
him
like
an
open
wound
.

She
had
jumped
away
from
his
shy
touch
like
a
cat
confronted
by
a
sidewinder
.

I
suppose
,
he
muttered
,
I
can
sell
the
outfit
for
enough
to
send
you
home
to
your
folks
,
once
we
find
a
settlement
.

They
wouldn't
have
sold
me
in
the
first
place
if
there'd
been
food
enough
to
go
around
.

I
might
have
starved
,
but
at
least
I
wouldn't
be
fried
to
a
crisp
and
soaked
with
dirt
!
!

He
had
never
seen
clouds
like
them
before
,
but
he
had
the
primitive
feel
of
danger
that
gripped
a
man
before
a
hurricane
in
Carolina
.

Walls
of
water
rushed
down
the
slopes
and
filled
the
hollows
like
the
crests
of
flash
floods
.

Through
the
splash
of
the
rising
waters
,
they
could
hear
the
roar
of
the
river
as
it
raged
through
its
canyon
,
gnashing
big
chunks
out
of
the
banks
.

Then
the
darkness
thinned
,
and
there
was
light
again
,
and
then
bright
sunlight
.

The
water
level
was
higher
than
their
hubs
.

She
was
watching
a
tree
ride
wildly
down
that
roiling
current
.

It
raced
closer
and
they
could
see
a
woman
with
white
hair
,
sitting
astride
an
upright
branch
.

They
watched
the
tree
until
it
twisted
sharply
on
a
bend
.

It
speared
up
into
the
air
,
then
sinking
back
,
the
up-jutting
branch
turned
slowly
.

There's
the
one
who's
lucky
!
!

Ben's
eyes
strained
with
the
bitter
hurt
,
his
homely
face
slashed
with
gray
and
crimson
.

Still
,
he
felt
better
.

A
tight
wagon
meant
so
much
.

He
found
a
jar
of
preserved
tomatoes
and
one
of
eggs
that
they
had
meant
to
save
.

Now
he
broke
them
open
,
hoping
a
good
meal
might
lessen
this
depression
crushing
Hettie
.

His
long
nose
wiggled
at
the
smells
of
frizzling
bacon
and
heating
java
,
but
the
fire
was
low
,
and
he
wanted
to
waste
no
time
.

He
looked
thoughtfully
at
his
wife's
trunk
,
holding
her
meager
treasures
.

If
you
want
to
get
them
aired

He
drew
a
long
breath
and
opened
the
trunk
and
hung
out
her
clothes
and
spoilables
upon
the
wagon
ribs
.

Sulphur
,
oil
,
and
copra
make
the
kind
of
tinder
any
firebug
dreams
of
.

The
lifeboats
were
stuck
fast
.

One
especially
bad
detonation
shook
Lifeboat
No.
3
which
trembled
violently
in
the
davits
.

We'd
be
in
real
trouble
then
.

I
was
puzzled
by
the
remark
,
then
I
recalled
the
voice
of
mild
Professor
Howard
Griggs
three
years
ago
in
a
university
lecture
on
primitive
societies
.

He
had
been
speaking
of
this
archipelago
:

There
had
been
classroom
guffaws
which
quickly
subsided
as
Professor
Griggs
said
dryly
:
I
see
your
point
,
Pauson
.

I
think
I
know
what
you
mean
,
Brassnose
,
I
said
.

I
know
something
about
Eromonga
.

Let's
hope
we
come
to
a
safer
place
.

It
is
Eromonga
--
look
hard
,
you
can
see
with
your
naked
eye
the
wooden
scaffolding
on
the
cliff
.

He
made
a
sound
of
despair
deep
in
his
throat
.

It
is
the
last
of
the
three
tests
of
manhood
which
the
women
impose
,
to
discover
if
a
male
is
worthy
of
survival
there
.

We
are
thirsty
and
hungry
;
;

I
noted
that
her
full
breasts
were
bare
and
that
she
wore
a
garland
of
red
pandanus
fruit
in
her
blue-black
hair
.

She
said
,
My
name
is
Songau
and
these
girls
are
Ponkob
and
Piwen
.

You
are
welcome
to
Eromonga
.

This
was
also
a
corpse
--
a
male
,
judging
from
the
coral
arm
bands
,
the
tribal
scars
still
discernible
on
the
maggoty
face
,
the
painted
bone
of
the
warrior
caste
which
still
pierced
the
septum
of
the
rotting
nose
.

As
if
divining
my
thoughts
,
the
girl
Songau
smiled
warmly
and
said
in
the
casual
tone
an
American
woman
might
use
in
describing
her
rose
garden
:

Is
it
not
well-made
?
?

The
maku
Frayne
has
inherited
this
strength
from
his
grandfather
.

They
despise
males
who
brag
of
their
strength
;
;

But
a
glance
at
Songau
and
the
other
women
confirmed
what
Brassnose
had
blurted
out
.

The
man
was
an
ox
and
he
put
up
a
creditable
struggle
;
;

My
last
impression
as
they
led
him
off
to
a
stockade
was
of
his
pale
face

Within
a
decade
or
less
,
few
men
were
left
and
a
feminist
society
had
sprung
up
.

All
men
went
away
from
here
.

Those
who
stayed
had
to
pass
tests
.

She
cackled
with
mirth
,
showing
the
stumps
of
betel-stained
teeth
.

In
the
shade
of
a
palm
tree
in
front
of
the
squalid
dwelling
I
saw
four
figures
in
a
semi-circle
on
the
ground
.

Benson
looked
up
and
saw
Ramey's
long
head
tilt
forward
to
rub
his
chin
on
the
stiff
edge
of
the
overall
bib
.

Nope
,
just
you
,
all
the
time
--
sometimes
I
think
it's
the
only
way
I'll
ever
get
a
decent
partner
.

Whenever
he
saw
someone
lying
in
the
dirt
,
Ramey
wondered
what
the
person
had
been
thinking
and
he
would
try
out
thoughts
in
his
own
mind
.

A
few
minutes
later
the
insurance
man
,
a
road
checker
,
drove
up
in
the
gray
coupe
with
license
plates
on
it
from
a
far-away
state
.

The
insurance
man
informed
them
that
he
had
talked
to
Crumley
who
was
all
right
and
that
he
would
watch
the
men's
personal
effects
until
they
towed
the
rig
back
to
town
.

Every
so
often
the
diminishing
sound
of
a
car
came
under
the
trailer
as
it
slowed
down
for
the
wreck
then
speeded
up
again
as
it
got
clear
.

When
they
were
ready
to
leave
,
Benson
and
Ramey
walked
back
around
the
rear
of
the
trailer
.

There's
a
body
you
won't
mind
looking
at
,
Benson
said
and
they
stopped
.

Their
work
was
lonely
.

She
began
to
watch
a
blonde-haired
man
,
also
in
shorts
,
standing
right
at
the
rear
of
the
wrecked
car
in
the
one
spot
that
most
of
the
crowd
had
detoured
slightly
.

What
had
caught
his
attention
was
obscured
by
the
car
itself
,
so
that
neither
the
girl
nor
the
truck
drivers
could
see
,
but
Benson
knew
what
it
was
.

The
girl
took
a
couple
of
steps
toward
the
man
in
shorts
when
Benson
,
in
that
barefoot
courtliness
Ramey
could
never
decide
was
real
,
said
,
You
don't
want
to
go
around
there
,
Ma'am
.

The
girl
stopped
but
did
not
turn
her
head
or
acknowledge
that
someone
had
spoken
to
her
.

With
Ramey
it
was
a
dusty
work
shoe
that
was
half-off
the
Indian's
foot
that
he
would
always
remember
.

There
was
nothing
in
particular
on
the
man's
face
.

But
what
is
it
?
?

The
man
had
spoken
only
once
.

The
sneaker
reached
out
once
more
to
tap
against
the
mass
and
Ramey's
vision
darkened
except
for
an
unreasonable
clarity
of
the
man's
leg
.

It
was
a
straight
,
solid
,
once-in-a-lifetime
shot
;
;

The
man
took
two
short
steps
backward
then
sat
down
heavily
on
the
pavement
.

As
he
watched
the
man
sit
suddenly
,
a
detached
part
of
his
mind
observed
how
very
difficult
it
was
,
really
,
to
knock
a
man
off
his
feet
.

With
a
thoughtful
look
,
the
man
sat
on
the
pavement
,
legs
straight
out
in
front
of
him
.

A
shine
in
her
eyes
suddenly
became
tears
and
she
turned
back
to
her
husband
again
.

Behind
Ramey
feet
scraped
beneath
sharp
questioning
whispers
.

Benson
moved
his
arms
,
gesturing
with
an
unfamiliar
vigor
and
talking
rapidly
.

He
saw
the
dark
sweat
spots
flip
in
and
out
of
sight
under
the
patrolman's
swinging
arms
and
in
the
leather
holster
that
swaggered
and
rolled
at
the
side
of
his
stocky
body
,
the
sun
left
a
smoky
shine
on
the
narrow
strip
of
blue
metal
that
ran
between
the
horned
handles
of
his
pistol
.

The
patrolman
said
to
no
one
in
particular
as
he
pushed
between
the
fat
man
in
the
baseball
cap
and
a
young
boy
in
levis
.

The
body
continued
to
lash
,
but
now
Keith
used
the
legs
of
the
chair
to
fork
the
loathsome
,
bloody
mass
out
of
the
bungalow
.

She
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
again
,
back
in
the
same
position
where
the
snake
had
found
her
.

You
love
this
village
and
these
stinking
brown
people
because
they
are
God's
creatures
,
too
.

All
of
us
,
that
is
,
except
me
.

He
knew
she
was
not
sulking
,
not
even
angry
at
him
.

But
Keith
looked
down
more
than
up
.

And
he
would
have
enjoyed
it
just
as
much
if
he
had
been
a
Nazi
.

It
was
a
war
of
nerves
,
of
stamina
,
of
dogged
endurance
in
which
the
stupid
insistence
of
the
British
on
their
right
to
their
own
country
became
ultimately
an
unsurmountable
obstacle
to
the
Nazis
,
who
were
better
organized
and
technically
superior
.

Penny
knew
him
better
,
on
her
part
.

They
don't
go
for
bull-like
muscle
,
as
a
rule
.

Keith
was
an
eagle
.

But
they
met
in
one
searing
moment
that
gave
them
to
one
another
instantly
.

But
there
hadn't
been
enough
time
to
build
it
for
keeps
.

There
was
a
shattering
,
cracking
sound
as
the
concrete
started
to
buckle
,
the
air
filled
with
dust
and
flying
debris
,
and
everyone
in
the
room
--
men
and
women
hit
the
floor
and
used
the
desks
as
turtlebacks
,
as
ordered
.

They
stood
there
,
just
the
two
of
them
,
in
the
rocking
,
shattering
blast
.

The
chaplain
married
them
,
on
the
next
day
.

And
in
the
hunting
land
,
this
hunger
was
considered
to
be
a
noble
thing
.

These
were
the
ones
Keith
sought
out
--
the
loners
,
the
ones
who
killed
for
the
joy
of
it
,
like
himself
.

He
and
Penny
would
go
out
on
tame
elephants
,
raised
from
babyhood
in
the
keddah
.

And
while
he
was
ever
alert
for
game
,
and
most
particularly
a
tiger
,
Penny
marvelled
at
the
Eden
they
were
traversing
.

All
I
have
to
do
to
set
the
record
is
to
go
on
down
.

He
stared
stonily
at
the
floor
.

Well
,
I
get
it
,
Artie
said
,
still
on
the
ladder
.

You
are
a
big
muscle-bound
ape
and
you
got
this
idea
about
setting
a
record
.

No
,
it
wasn't
that
,
Rob
said
.

A
note
of
awe
came
into
his
voice
.

I
was
expecting
it
,
sure
.

Anyway
,
Waddell
went
on
.

Hell
,
I
gave
him
the
first
decent
job
he
ever
had
,
six
,
seven
--
how
many
years
ago
was
it
,
Rob
?
?

He
was
thinking
,
big
deal
:
skipper
on
his
drunken
fishing
parties
for
seven
years
and
no
better
off
than
when
I
started
.

He
went
down
the
steps
to
the
galley
and
sleeping
quarters
;
;

When
you
gotta
go
,
you
gotta
go
,
Mrs.
Forsythe
said
.

He
was
disturbed
by
what
had
happened
on
the
dive
and
by
what
he
remembered
of
a
conversation
he
had
had
the
night
before
with
the
German
,
who
had
come
out
of
the
head
while
he
was
fixing
himself
a
drink
in
the
galley
.

Waddell
had
looked
the
man
over
,
trying
to
size
him
up
.

He
was
in
his
early
forties
,
rather
short
and
very
compactly
built
,
and
with
a
manner
that
was
reserved
and
stiff
despite
his
efforts
to
adapt
himself
to
American
ways
.

Yes
,
Herr
Schaffner
had
said
.

I
like
that
kid
.

Waddell
turned
to
face
him
.

I
have
in
Europe
a
gross
business
of
seven
million
dollars
the
year
.

I
must
have
a
powerful
representative
here
,
a
firm
with
a
national
distribution
and
ten
,
twenty
thousand
dollars
to
advertise
my
products
.

But
surely
you
have
misunderstood
Mr.
Roy
.

We
spoke
of
the
need
for
advertising
,
and
I
agreed
that
the
deep
dive
would
be
most
useful
for
publicity
.

of
course
,
I
was
willing
.

There
was
the
end
of
his
front-page
feature
story
,
with
byline
.

I
know
this
from
my
talks
with
him
.

Well
,
let's
let
him
make
up
his
own
mind
,
OK
?
?

He
took
a
big
swig
of
his
drink
.

I
guess
you
are
right
.

Thank
you
,
the
German
had
said
courteously
.

Fear
and
relief
mingled
in
his
churning
emotions
.

Let
me
set
the
record
this
time
,
and
let
me
get
back
OK
,
so
the
German
will
give
me
the
exclusive
.

Anyway
,
I
wasn't
down
long
enough
to
matter
.

For
a
while
he
was
content
to
let
events
develop
in
their
good
time
.

His
superiors
had
emphasized
that
marines
tortured
others
for
the
sheer
pleasure
.

Besides
the
belt
he
wore
a
loin
cloth
.

Fresh
on
his
mind
were
events
of
the
past
day
when
his
whole
regiment
was
destroyed
in
the
hills
.

Even
now
,
like
a
ringing
in
his
ears
,
he
heard
the
wooooosh
of
flame-throwers
squirting
great
orange
billows
.

A
wave
of
flame
rippling
through
their
cave
had
reached
Nagamo
,
his
friend
,
and
with
a
shriek
the
man
bolted
through
the
entrance
,
then
slowed
to
the
jerky
walk
of
a
puppet
,
his
uniform
blazing
.

When
he
sank
on
his
knees
,
they
had
allowed
him
to
char
without
administering
the
stroke
of
mercy
.

At
nightfall
he
had
been
able
to
sneak
down
a
hillside
and
into
the
jungle
,
reeking
of
death
.

Cautious
feet
stepping
on
leafmold
;
;

Humiliation
made
Matsuo
tremble
.

The
jungle
did
not
retort
.

Five
or
so
minutes
later
the
marine
abruptly
pulled
up
and
stepped
into
sunlight
,
immediately
throwing
his
hands
over
his
eyes
.

The
marine
was
alone
,
for
they
were
impatient
people
and
by
now
would
have
vied
to
knock
him
from
the
tree
.

Matsuo
jumped
when
the
hidden
arm
flopped
out
.

He
squatted
by
the
head
,
gently
placing
the
rifle
on
the
ground
.

around
the
hole
,
blood
glistened
in
a
little
patch
.

One
by
one
he
tossed
the
objects
aside
.

He
didn't
smoke
and
could
not
light
fires
with
a
flintless
lighter
;
;

Too
bad
the
marine
had
no
water
.

The
cap
was
stuck
and
made
a
thin
rusty
squeaking
as
he
applied
pressure
.

Some
odor
made
him
lean
over
the
man
.

He
sniffed
and
recognized
it
.

When
he
rolled
on
the
left
side
,
propping
on
his
left
elbow
,
Matsuo
seized
his
hair
and
pulled
him
back
over
.

Matsuo
took
the
small
knife
from
its
scabbard
and
laid
it
on
the
ground
,
out
of
the
marine's
reach
and
away
from
their
shadows
.

He
waited
in
his
squat
,
gripping
the
hair
.

The
sun
was
noon
high
and
Matsuo
perspired
until
his
body
was
dripping
.

He
must
have
saturated
himself
in
the
drink
,
for
the
bullet
not
to
shock
him
out
of
his
drunken
haze
.

The
marine
yelled
and
flung
the
hand
away
.

The
man
tilted
back
his
head
and
went
through
the
pantomime
of
drinking
from
a
container
.

He
performed
the
act
twice
more
,
and
the
begging
in
his
tone
grew
more
distinct
.

The
marine
slumped
forward
into
a
bow
like
a
priest
before
an
idol
.

One
swallow
was
all
he
would
have
;
;

He
began
to
uncap
the
bottle
,
the
rusty
cap
squealing
on
its
threads
.

And
when
this
was
gone
,
he
hadn't
even
a
little
bitter
tablet
to
purify
other
water
if
he
were
to
discover
some
stagnant
jungle
pool
.

He
capped
the
bottle
and
replaced
it
.

There
is
nothing
for
you
,
Matsuo
said
.

I've
nothing
for
you
.

He
reminded
Matsuo
of
a
similar
thing
he
had
witnessed
in
China
.

Chairs
scraped
back
and
customers
hastily
vacated
their
tables
as
the
tall
young
buffalo
hunter
pushed
open
the
swing
doors
and
walked
towards
the
bar
.

Stay
right
here
where
you
are
,
kid
,
he
called
.

The
kid
has
no
manners
,
boys
.

Tilghman
flung
himself
aside
,
dropped
on
one
knee
and
pulled
his
own
gun
.

The
Colt
roared
twice
and
two
men
dropped
,
writhing
.

He
fired
again
,
and
somewhere
in
the
gloom
a
man
screamed
.

Somebody
brought
a
light
.

I've
come
for
Pat
Conyers'
body
.

In
two
minutes
the
body
of
Tilghman's
former
comrade
,
who
had
been
killed
by
Blue
Throat
in
a
gambling
brawl
the
previous
night
,
was
carried
into
the
town's
funeral
parlor
to
be
prepared
for
decent
burial
.

The
prediction
was
correct
.

There's
only
one
thing
to
move
him
fast
,
and
we
have
it
right
here
in
this
very
store
.

Billy
returned
with
six
sticks
of
dynamite
.

He
slipped
outside
,
hugging
the
walls
of
buildings
and
dodging
into
doorways
.

Led
by
Bill
Doolin
,
these
mobsters
specialized
in
train
robberies
but
as
a
sideline
they
looted
stores
and
robbed
banks
,
making
liberal
use
of
their
guns
.

Tilghman
knew
that
some
ranchers
were
hand-in-glove
with
the
Doolin
gang
.

On
a
bitterly
cold
day
in
January
,
1895
,
accompanied
only
by
Neal
Brown
as
his
deputy
,
Tilghman
left
the
township
of
Guthrie
and
headed
for
Rock
Fort
and
Dunn's
ranch
.

The
only
evidence
of
occupation
came
from
the
chimney
,
which
was
belching
out
thick
smoke
.

If
I
don't
come
out
within
half
an
hour
ride
back
to
town
and
bring
out
a
posse
.

The
rancher
grunted
an
acknowledgement
but
didn't
move
.

Along
each
side
of
the
room
were
six
tiered
bunks
,
each
one
screened
off
with
a
curtain
.

He
walked
right
up
to
the
fire
as
though
blissfully
unaware
of
the
guns
covering
him
.

If
he
showed
signs
of
collecting
his
rifle
and
going
back
with
his
deputy
to
the
ranch
he
would
be
shot
down
instantly
.

Don't
say
or
do
anything
,
he
said
softly
.

We'll
let
him
go
.

When
she
would
do
these
things
,
he
would
turn
blind
for
an
instant
and
become
sick
at
his
stomach
.

When
he
awoke
in
the
mornings
,
she
was
in
his
mind
and
he
could
hardly
wait
to
get
to
school
to
be
near
her
in
the
flesh
.

All
,
that
is
,
except
Jack
.

He
didn't
look
back
and
he
ran
until
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
schoolhouse
and
out
of
breath
;
;

then
he
slowed
to
a
walk
.

I'll
get
her
yet
,
he
muttered
to
himself
.

No
,
I
am
not
hungry
,
he
said
,
pushing
back
the
bacon
and
eggs
.

Don't
you
play
hard
today
then
.

Jack
knew
of
course
that
the
tale
to
be
unfolded
would
involve
a
girl
and
probably
be
dirty
,
because
girls
were
Charles'
only
apparent
interest
.

I
got
Margaret
Rider
in
one
of
them
old
box
cars
down
there
by
the
quarry
.

His
heart
beat
faster
.

He
said
,
lapsing
into
the
profanity
he
often
used
when
away
from
his
parents
and
especially
when
he
was
with
Charles
.

Hell
,
I
jist
got
on
top
of
--

Hell
,
I
jist
ask
her
.

Besides
I
heard
her
old
uncle
that
stays
there
has
been
doin'
it
.

Oh
,
come
on
Miss
Langford
,
play
with
us
just
onct
,
one
of
the
little
girls
begged
,
smiling
wistfully
.

Occasionally
he
would
look
across
the
aisle
at
Margaret
,
fourteen
and
demure
in
a
fresh
green
organdy
dress
,
sitting
in
the
sixth-grade
row
,
and
he
could
hardly
believe
she
would
do
what
Charles
had
said
she
did
.

At
noontime
,
remembering
what
the
teacher
had
said
about
maybe
playing
with
the
kids
,
Jack
stayed
close
to
the
schoolhouse
while
all
the
other
big
boys
,
except
Charles
,
went
off
out
the
road
to
play
ball
.

Why
ain't
you
playin'
ball
?
?

Maybe
some
of
'em
will
fall
down
and
we'll
see
up
their
dress
.

Presently
she
came
out
of
the
schoolhouse
.

Let's
play
with
'em
,
Jack
said
,
rising
from
where
he
sat
on
the
ground
and
dusting
off
his
overall
pants
.

While
she
was
struggling
to
get
her
skirt
down
and
get
on
her
feet
again
,
Jack
ran
over
,
offered
her
his
hand
and
said
,
Gosh
,
I
am
sorry
,
Miss
Langford
.

That's
all
right
,
she
said
,
tossing
her
head
back
to
get
the
hair
out
of
her
eyes
.

Thank
you
,
she
said
,
dusting
herself
off
.

Will
you
play
with
us
again
,
Miss
Langford
?
?

When
he
came
back
to
the
schoolhouse
,
his
mind
was
made
up
.

He
scarcely
saw
them
.

On
the
fringe
of
the
amused
throng
of
white
onlookers
stood
a
young
woman
of
remarkable
beauty
and
poise
.

The
youth
with
the
snake
had
a
natural
pride
and
joy
of
life
which
appealed
to
the
woman
.

Lithe
and
muscular
,
he
had
well-molded
features
,
and
his
light
color
told
of
the
European
ancestors
who
had
been
intimate
with
the
slave
women
of
his
family
.

The
slaves
ran
gaily
to
the
center
of
Congo
Square
and
gathered
around
a
sweaty
youth
they
called
Johnny
No-Name
.

The
dance
was
of
Haitian
origin
.

He
proudly
wore
the
blue
livery
of
her
house
,
for
the
girl
was
Madame
Delphine
Lalaurie
,
wife
of
the
prominent
surgeon
,
Dr.
Louis
Lalaurie
,
who
bore
one
of
the
South's
oldest
and
most
cherished
names
.

Delphine
was
a
pace-setter
in
high
society
.

Madame
Lalaurie
gestured
with
her
riding
crop
toward
the
20-year-old
youth
who
was
stomping
and
writhing
with
the
king
snake
still
draped
over
his
bare
shoulders
.

The
slender
,
handsome
fellow
was
called
Dandy
Brandon
by
the
other
slaves
.

He
was
gifted
with
animal
magnetism
and
a
potent
allure
for
women
of
any
race
.

What
is
your
name
,
boy
?
?

Then
he
smiled
shyly
.

She
said
with
intense
feeling
:
Come
near
,
let
me
feel
your
arms
.

Lifting
her
skirts
,
she
climbed
in
,
never
relinquishing
her
grip
on
his
arm
.

Another
youth
,
Madame
?
?

Dr.
Louis
Lalaurie
stood
on
the
veranda
at
the
head
of
the
driveway
and
watched
his
carriage
as
it
approached
the
pillared
mansion
.

The
lad's
once
superb
body
was
a
mass
of
scars
and
welts
.

You
did
this
you
like
to
hurt
to
beat
people
I
want
to
go
home
.

Guests
stared
with
horror
at
Madame
Lalaurie
and
made
speedy
departures
.

After
I
paid
Monsieur
Prieur
for
Dandy
,
I
brought
him
home
,
but
he
was
ill
at
ease
and
ran
away
the
same
night
.

He
must
have
fallen
in
with
evil
companions
,
for
he
was
a
simple
youth
and
quite
trusting
and
inexperienced
.

Ruffians
must
have
robbed
and
beaten
him
before
bringing
him
back
to
our
house
to
die
.

Moreover
,
runaway
slaves
frequently
got
into
serious
trouble
in
New
Orleans'
dives
.

It
had
been
a
very
long
time
that
had
no
form
and
no
end
.

He
was
--
as
he
told
himself
in
the
vernacular
of
a
trade
no
longer
his
own
--
riding
the
dark
train
out
.

Out
and
out
and
never
to
return
again
.

He
was
pressed
far
back
into
the
corner
of
the
car
on
his
hay
sacks
,
the
rattling
and
tinning
of
the
wheels
on
the
rails
almost
covering
the
sound
of
his
ocarina
.

The
train
slowed
at
a
road
crossing
,
and
the
big
door
slid
open
;
;

A
poet
,
yet
!
!

Then
the
boy
straight-armed
himself
up
,
twisting
at
the
last
moment
so
he
landed
sitting
.

The
boy
yanked
her
back
hard
,
tugging
her
off
her
feet
,
and
gathered
her
into
the
crook
of
his
arm
.

Now
stay
with
me
,
Kitty
,
he
snapped
irritably
.

Feathertop
inquired
,
lounging
against
the
freight's
vibrating
wall
.

We
--
we
eloped
,
Cappy
said
.

Well
,
congratulations
.

They
couldn't
have
much
dough
,
but
then
none
of
the
freight-bums
Feathertop
rolled
had
much
.

That
was
gonna
be
fun
collecting
!
!

Come
sit
,
he
repeated
,
motioning
to
the
piled
hay
bags
,
over
the
pig
leavings
.

it
had
been
a
long
,
hot
while
since
he'd
seen
anything
as
nice
as
this
within
grabbin'
distance
.

He
had
it
all
doped
,
of
course
.

Slug
the
kid
,
grab
his
dough
--
at
least
enough
to
get
to
Philadelphia
--
and
then
have
a
rockin'
ball
with
the
doll
.

Where
from
?
?

He
reached
once
more
into
the
carpet
bag
and
brought
up
a
package
of
wieners
.

Not
the
greatest
,
but
they
stick
to
your
belly
insides
.

Nice
kid
,
Ernie
thought
,
too
bad
.

Cappy
looked
down
at
his
wide
hands
,
and
did
not
reply
.

Your
fault
,
hell
!
!

What's
the
matter
?
?

The
girl
still
did
not
raise
her
eyes
,
but
she
added
simply
,
I
am
pregnant
.

He
thought
,
Pull
out
of
it
,
old
son
.

You
gonna
give
me
a
drink
,
fella
?
?

Sure
,
he
said
,
and
lifted
the
pint
to
his
own
lips
.

The
man
stalked
toward
them
,
his
big
boots
heavy
on
the
wooden
flooring
.

The
kid
hit
the
bigger
man
with
an
audible
thwump
!
!

He
held
the
knife
aloft
an
instant
--
an
instant
enough
to
press
the
stud
.

But
this
was
not
unusual
,
because
youth
in
these
quarters
was
always
pushed
at
a
distance
from
its
elders
.

The
only
thing
unusual
about
the
Old
Man
had
long
since
happened
.

But
the
past
was
dead
here
as
the
present
was
dead
.

Once
the
Old
Man
had
had
a
wife
.

And
once
she
,
too
,
ignored
him
.

Puttana
!
!

For
all
he
saw
or
cared
to
see
,
this
could
have
been
a
town
in
Italy
,
not
the
outskirts
of
Philadelphia
.

Or
that
the
tiny
creek
spun
its
silent
course
toward
the
Schuylkill
?
?

It
swayed
with
the
wicker
swings
and
screeched
with
the
rusted
hinges
of
screen
doors
.

And
the
coffee
shop
on
Drexel
Street
,
where
the
men
spent
their
evenings
and
Sundays
playing
cards
,
had
a
rose
hedge
beneath
its
window
.

The
hedge
reeked
of
coffee
dregs
thrown
against
it
.

It
squatted
low
and
square
upon
the
sidewalk
with
a
heavy
iron
grating
supporting
a
glass
facade
.

That
was
Bartoli's
shop
.

Love
and
hatred
and
fear
were
one
here
,
shaded
only
by
fig
trees
and
grape
vines
.

They
kept
him
alive
,
waiting
.

He
was
holding
out
for
something
.

He
was
determined
to
hold
out
.

At
fifteen
he
didn't
care
that
he
had
no
mother
,
that
he
couldn't
remember
her
face
or
her
touch
;
;

neither
did
he
care
that
Aunt
Rose
provided
for
him
.

He
was
named
Pompeii
as
a
tribute
to
his
heritage
,
and
he
couldn't
have
cared
less
about
that
either
.

He
would
not
ride
the
eight-thirty
local
to
the
city
each
morning
.

He
would
sit
inside
the
coffee
shop
and
pound
a
gloved
fist
upon
the
table
and
a
girl
would
hear
him
and
come
running
,
bowing
with
her
running
,
calling
out
in
her
bowing
,
At
your
service
.

She
was
only
ten
months
older
than
he
.

One
lithe
leg
straddled
the
railing
and
swung
loosely
before
the
creaking
,
torn
pales
.

He
was
never
sure
they
fully
took
him
in
.

Pompeii
called
again
,
Laura
!
!

Above
him
slid
the
evasive
shadow
of
a
storm
cloud
.

But
the
boy
could
see
only
the
goat's
belly
.

There
would
be
time
enough
,
perhaps
the
Old
Man
reassured
himself
,
to
pay
the
devil
his
due
.

He
knew
at
a
glance
that
the
biggest
sandals
belonged
to
Niobe
,
the
neatest
ones
to
Concetta
,
and
the
laced
ones
to
Romeo
,
Concetta's
idiot
brother
.

she
developed
a
peaches
and
cream
complexion
and
a
sunny
disposition
,
and
she
asked
for
nothing
more
of
life
than
that
she
be
kept
dry
and
comfortable
and
fed
huge
amounts
of
food
at
stated
intervals
and
be
carried
to
where
she
could
watch
activity
going
on
around
her
.

Maggie
and
Stuart
pored
over
figures
every
night
,
trying
to
find
how
they
could
squeeze
out
a
few
pennies
more
.

She
had
been
watching
Maggie
go
from
the
washing
machine
to
the
baby
to
the
stove
and
back
again
.

It's
too
elaborate
.

Oh
,
I
am
sure
I
could
do
that
,
Maggie
said
.

And
then
whenever
I
have
a
minute
I
can
be
working
at
it
,
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
baby
and
the
stove
at
the
same
time
.

What
are
you
going
to
do
with
your
feet
so
you
don't
waste
anything
?
?

It
grew
bitterly
cold
toward
the
end
of
November
,
contributing
to
the
miseries
of
countless
numbers
of
people
.

The
government
offices
were
being
opened
but
they
weren't
being
opened
fast
enough
and
meanwhile
the
cold
penetrated
everything
.

Something
had
to
be
done
about
the
furnace
,
the
fuel
bills
,
the
washing
machine
,
the
doctor
and
dentist
bills
,
about
making
money
stretch
for
food
,
for
the
mortgage
,
for
taxes
,
for
shoes
,
for
half
soles
,
for
overshoes
,
for
clothes
,
for
the
new
leaks
in
the
roof
,
for
gas
and
light
bills
;
;

about
keeping
warm
,
about
keeping
well
,
about
meeting
the
minor
emergencies
that
came
up
once
,
twice
,
fifty
times
a
day
.

Just
dropping
the
baby's
bottle
and
breaking
it
became
a
catastrophe
,
and
Stuart
wore
out
his
shoes
so
fast
that
he
was
termed
a
major
disaster
.

The
pipes
burst
and
they
all
laughed
and
stood
in
ice
water
to
their
ankles
while
they
swabbed
the
bathrooms
.

You
said
a
mouthful
,
Eugenia
said
grimly
.

Plenty
of
people
are
poor
all
their
lives
.

I
know
you
when
you
start
talking
about
brains
and
talent
,
Maggie
said
.

You
are
working
up
to
something
,
and
if
you
don't
watch
out
you'll
ruin
your
whole
life
one
of
these
days
just
to
prove
that
the
Abernathy
family
is
superior
to
everything
,
even
a
depression
.

She
didn't
want
to
be
the
only
one
with
a
stove
in
her
room
,
especially
as
her
life
span
was
nearly
run
out
anyway
,
and
she
insisted
that
Hope
have
the
heater
.

Laban
had
more
to
say
.

Tolley
had
gone
to
live
in
California
.

Kizzie
turned
to
go
inside
.

Let
me
stay
and
take
the
pictures
you
wanted
,
Mamma
.

The
sun's
right
--

Indeed
you
are
!
!

Hurry
,
Frank
!
!

I
was
so
cruel
to
Tolley
,
so
unfair
.

I
marry
this
man
and
woman
together
.

He
questioned
God's
taking
time
to
telegraph
the
message
,
but
he
felt
better
about
Kizzie
,
and
he
took
the
sealed
envelope
from
its
pigeonhole
,
wondering
why
he
had
preserved
it
.

It
was
simply
his
necessity
to
confess
which
had
made
him
write
and
keep
this
thing
.

Surely
now
his
beloved
son
could
rest
in
peace
.

A
beautiful
and
haunting
line
,
a
subtle
genius
,
Swinburne
,
difficult
not
to
envy
a
gifted
man
,
and
perhaps
he
did
.

Beyond
his
window
were
the
greening
trees
,
new
spring
,
eternal
hope
,
eternal
life
.

But
this
last
time
he
drank
not
to
Brace
but
To
Tolley
!
!

And
if
I
ever
hear
you
say
'
Mist
Laban
'
again
I'll
scream
.

He
,
with
fifteen
or
twenty
horses
or
mares
or
geldings
or
what-nots
out
there
in
the
barn
,
was
reverent
only
of
the
Mare
,
the
Racin'
Mare
,
the
revolting
Gunny
.

She
musn't
annoy
Gunny
whose
foal
was
due
then
too
!
!

Tillie
was
a
fine
midwife
and
could
get
here
quick
,
he
suggested
.

Jenny's
aversion
to
having
Dr.
Dunne
,
a
former
admirer
,
seemed
silly
to
him
,
but
he
would
humor
her
,
get
anybody
she
wanted
,
the
best
never
being
too
good
for
her
.

The
chances
were
against
his
being
here
to
humor
her
when
her
time
came
,
she
was
sure
.

Night
after
night
he
stayed
with
Gunny
in
the
dead
of
winter
,
rubbing
her
with
quarts
of
expensive
liniment
,
fussing
over
her
bran
mash
as
the
cook
did
over
charlotte
russe
,
tracking
manure
on
the
pretty
new
carpet
when
he
did
come
to
the
house
.

Handsomest
colt
in
all
Kentucky
.

Those
elegant
At
Home
cards
she
sent
out
,
now
she
could
wear
her
pretty
clothes
again
,
and
had
the
house
all
trimmed
up
,
hadn't
brought
many
callers
in
two
whole
months
.

Miss
Kizzie
had
been
right
snippy
ever
since
they
were
married
,
though
you'd
have
thought
a
namesake
would
have
brought
her
round
.

More
and
more
,
these
days
,
she'd
been
driving
that
pretty
little
mare
that
looked
like
her
,
over
to
Tillie's
and
Nick's
--
his
own
old
square
frame
box
on
posts
,
chickens
and
cats
and
pups
under
the
house
,
everybody
friendly
inside
,
making
a
to-do
over
the
babies
dressed
like
dollies
.

Though
he
was
glad
she
got
on
well
with
his
young
folks
,
she
ought
to
be
welcome
at
the
finest
house
in
the
land
,
too
.

She
hoped
they
were
well
.

We'll
have
oystchers
--
couple
bar'l
oystchers'll
fetch
in
a
crowd
any
time
.

Miss
Kiz
won't
care
your
comin'
,
will
she
?
?

He
must
have
forgiven
me
,
Henrietta
murmured
to
the
room
.

Adelia
was
the
good
one
,
or
,
if
not
always
good
,
less
frequently
tempted
.

In
winter
,
in
the
city
,
there
had
been
the
Maneret
School
,
which
taught
excellently
with
a
kind
of
austere
passion
for
knowledge
;
;

Mama
had
died
before
the
corruption
of
the
family
circle
,
the
interruption
of
Charles
.

But
I
would
have
gone
anyway
,
thought
Henrietta
.

No
temptation
,
no
virtue
?
?

Before
anything
else
,
she
would
go
to
Doaty's
grave
with
flowers
from
Doaty's
forgotten
garden
.

Everything
must
wait
upon
this
mission
,
this
sentimental
duty
of
a
pilgrim
whose
nature
avoided
graveyards
.

She
closed
her
eyes
,
remembering
the
small
French
cemetery
,
enclosed
by
stone
walls
.

After
the
sad
impatient
moment
,
waiting
for
comfort
which
could
not
come
,
she
slipped
out
of
bed
and
went
to
the
open
window
.

The
garden
below
was
lacy
with
dew
and
enchanting
in
its
small
wildness
.

Folly
danced
,
eager
for
whatever
lay
beyond
the
door
.

She
smiled
and
bowed
,
recalling
the
princess-in-a-carriage
feeling
she
had
enjoyed
when
she
was
a
child
.

Now
,
some
of
the
acknowledgments
were
cautious
,
but
all
were
interested
.

It's
my
dryin'
out
time
.

It's
dryin'
myself
out
that
does
it
.

Every
month
,
f'r
three
days
,
he
said
happily
,
I
take
no
water
into
my
system
,
no
water
whatsoever
.

Henrietta
murmured
that
she
could
quite
see
how
it
would
,
and
he
nodded
approval
of
her
womanly
good
sense
.

She
did
suddenly
,
through
the
link
of
memory
with
his
father
,
old
Titus
,
who
must
have
been
in
his
nineties
when
Henrietta
ran
away
.

It
must
be
that
son
who
sat
before
her
now
,
shriveled
to
half
his
size
and
half
his
senses
.

She
said
gently
,
Of
course
I
remember
you
.

I
know
all
about
you
.

Any
harm
in
that
?
?

You'd
be
the
one
to
say
,
he
observed
,
and
she
found
herself
liking
his
approval
none
too
well
,
but
she
could
not
defend
herself
and
say
that
her
actions
were
different
,
since
all
actions
had
their
own
laws
.

Milk
and
sops
!
!

He's
got
this
idea
about
drying
out

The
children
are
eating
,
and
Miss
Blackwell's
on
her
way
somewheres
.

To
the
graveyard
.

The
woman
(
she
must
have
been
a
tiny
baby
when
Hetty
and
Delia
had
stood
arm
in
arm
,
watching
great
age
grow
small
)
answered
the
nod
with
her
own
.

Come
on
now
.

He
mumbled
at
her
but
let
himself
be
led
off
inside
the
house
,
shuffling
mightily
to
make
it
clear
how
weak
and
aged
he
was
and
how
he
was
buffeted
about
by
those
who
still
had
their
wicked
strength
.

Henrietta
looked
down
at
her
bouquet
,
still
lively
with
its
color
and
scent
,
and
set
her
feet
on
their
journey's
way
again
,
leaving
the
village
street
and
crossing
the
first
field
,
Folly
dancing
ahead
of
her
.

At
the
edge
of
the
field
,
the
wild
rolling
land
took
over
,
dotted
with
fat
round
bushes
like
sheep
.

She
felt
mindless
,
walking
,
and
almost
easy
until
the
church
spire
told
her
she
was
near
the
cemetery
,
and
she
caught
herself
wondering
what
she
would
say
to
Doaty
.

A
small
,
rock-carved
angel
watched
her
from
a
nearby
tomb
,
the
only
angel
in
the
cemetery
.

The
Ainus
were
a
primitive
people
,
already
living
on
the
island
before
the
principal
ancestors
of
the
Japanese
came
from
Southern
Asia
.

Apparently
they
were
of
Caucasian
blood
.

all
their
men
were
bearded
,
and
many
of
their
women
were
beautiful
.

She
had
changed
into
a
cocktail
dress
,
and
the
whole
evening
should
have
been
before
her
,
but
already
she
was
beginning
to
get
a
tight
feeling
at
the
back
of
her
neck
.

When
he
saw
Tommy
sitting
alone
,
the
tinkling
sound
stopped
.

He
was
perhaps
a
trifle
tipsy
,
having
been
long
at
sea
where
drinking
is
not
permitted
,
and
consequently
out
of
practice
;
;

he
wore
a
brown
tweed
sports
jacket
obviously
tailored
in
Hong
Kong
,
and
he
was
of
an
age
that
marked
him
as
a
lieutenant
.

You
see
,
I
thought
--
I
mean
I
really
had
no
idea
--

Uh
--
sorry
!
!

It
hadn't
been
this
way
in
college
,
or
in
nurses'
training
;
;

Everybody
but
Tommy
seemed
to
think
it
was
charming
when
they
called
,
Bifutek-san
!
!

For
a
steak
sandwich
,
or
Kohi
Futotsu
!
!

One
was
with
a
whitehaired
and
doting
lieutenant
commander
;
;

Seeing
these
did
nothing
for
Tommy's
mood
.

And
tomorrow
she
would
take
time
to
shop
for
the
kimono
her
mother
wanted
to
present
to
the
young
wife
of
a
faculty
member
as
a
hostess
gown
.

The
lieutenant
was
not
entirely
wrong
in
the
belief
.

The
war
found
him
much
too
early
,
and
its
perils
--
and
especially
its
awful
boredom
--
were
best
forgotten
in
horseplay
and
elaborate
practical
jokes
,
and
even
now
Doc
had
never
found
any
stabilizing
,
sobering
influence
.

He
may
not
rise
to
the
heights
,
but
he
can
get
by
,
and
eventually
be
retired
.

Come
over
and
have
a
drink
.

See
you
in
about
an
hour
.

How
,
he
wondered
,
does
one
enjoy
one's
spare
time
?
?

I
could
,
he
thought
,
take
a
long
walk
--
but
where
?
?

Strippers
,
but
scrumptious
,
and
Toodle
Williams
and
her
all-lesbian
band
.

He
laughed
and
laughed
.

Buzz
was
a
tireless
instigator
who
never
let
his
victims
rest
.

He
was
disappointed
to
find
a
nervous
,
scrawny
woman
with
a
big
hat
standing
at
the
door
.

She
said
,
semi-professionally
.

We
call
them
lay-sisters
and
they
go
among
the
Eskimos
making
friends
and
bringing
the
light
.

They
are
up
there
in
that
freezing
climate
and
all
of
us
have
to
try
and
help
them
.

Several
people
passed
in
the
hall
and
stared
as
he
slowly
retreated
,
trying
to
close
the
door
a
little
,
and
she
slowly
leaned
toward
him
and
raised
her
voice
.

I
am
sure
the
hotel
doesn't
know
you
are
wandering
around
the
corridors
,
knocking
on
strangers'
doors
and
talking
down
Eskimos
.

Owen
was
aware
he
was
getting
overexcited
but
he
couldn't
help
himself
.

Not
that
religion
isn't
big
business
;
;

Our
key
salesmen
are
in
appliances
and
cosmetics
.

More
people
were
passing
;
;

Probably
down
at
the
bar
.

Can't
you
help
them
?
?

I
have
no
card
,
she
said
bitterly
.

She
looked
crestfallen
,
as
if
he
had
somehow
disappointed
the
whole
human
race
.

There
was
a
check
from
his
company
,
and
the
usual
enthusiastic
bulletins
on
new
lines
they
always
issued
.

He
ate
breakfast
in
a
sullen
mood
,
but
afterwards
,
when
he
walked
out
onto
Virginia
Street
,
he
felt
braced
.

There
were
more
women
than
men
in
the
place
,
but
he
couldn't
find
a
flowerpot
.

The
women
had
a
bright
shining
expectancy
as
they
leaned
out
from
the
wall
and
gazed
splendidly
into
the
distance
,
while
the
men
were
stern
but
hopeful
.

He
sat
down
next
to
a
heavily-upholstered
blonde
,
but
she
was
cleaned
out
in
twenty
minutes
.

She
sighed
a
dirty
word
and
left
.

She
sat
down
and
played
two
slots
at
once
,
looking
grim
,
as
if
bested
by
mechanical
devices
,
and
Owen
felt
sorry
for
the
lay-sisters
depending
on
her
support
.

What
you
need
is
a
steady
martingale
,
the
cowboy
announced
after
watching
Owen
play
.

What
are
you
playing
?
?

Well
,
of
course
I
do
.

I
am
with
the
Bar-H
,
pushing
a
horse
called
Sparky
.

He's
a
pinto
and
he
photographs
wonderfully
.

There
was
no
cash
around
;
;

Owen
went
over
to
the
crap
table
and
the
dice
were
hot
,
but
he
couldn't
pyramid
with
any
consecutive
success
.

How's
your
luck
,
honey
?
?

She
looked
well-fed
and
prosperous
,
but
he
didn't
get
the
impression
he
was
being
propositioned
the
way
he'd
been
hoping
.

I'll
make
them
dance
the
tango
.

We'll
get
it
in
a
hurry
and
get
it
out
.

If
you
go
broke
,
she
said
,
smiling
up
at
him
,
I'll
leave
you
.

My
name's
Gisele
,
the
blonde
said
after
she
ordered
a
Scotch
.

Spencer
was
quiet
for
a
moment
longer
,
then
he
said
,
There
is
nothing
I
want
to
say
,
Captain
.

Naval
procedure
,
he
thought
,
had
its
moments
of
grim
humor
.

More
arrests
,
I
fear
.

He
is
the
oldest
and
most
experienced
of
the
lot
.

Heiser
,
breathless
and
wild-eyed
,
brought
the
chilling
news
that
the
handspikes
,
heavers
and
holystones
had
been
mysteriously
removed
from
their
customary
places
.

And
also
,
sir
,
two
articles
which
were
considered
souvenirs
now
must
be
regarded
in
another
light
entirely
.

Alexander
guessed
that
they
had
planned
confusion
and
turmoil
,
thinking
it
the
ideal
climate
in
which
to
begin
battle
and
bloodshed
.

Their
strategy
was
sound
enough
and
,
he
reasoned
,
had
been
defeated
only
by
Philip
Spencer's
unwillingness
to
sanction
an
idea
he
had
not
originated
.

Tillotson
had
reported
the
man
to
Gansevoort
and
an
hour
later
,
with
back
turned
,
had
been
attacked
by
Wilson
,
brandishing
the
weapon
.

Besides
,
suppose
we
hold
a
court
of
inquiry
,
then
what
?
?

The
instinct
of
discipline
has
been
lost
.

And
we
are
positive
of
so
few
and
suspicious
of
so
many
.

Those
of
us
present
,
the
Perry
brothers
,
Deslonde
and
the
other
midshipmen
now
have
the
responsibility
of
the
Somers
.

And
when
he
was
alone
again
in
the
cabin
,
Alexander
lowered
his
head
into
his
arms
and
wept
,
for
he
knew
full
well
what
must
be
done
,
what
in
the
end
would
be
done
.

With
all
his
heart
he
had
loved
the
Navy
and
now
he
must
act
in
accordance
with
the
Navy's
implacable
laws
.

He
said
,
Captain
,
may
I
speak
,
please
?
?

Before
God
I
swear
I
am
innocent
.

I
cannot
speak
for
others
,
sir
,
but
I
am
innocent
.

He
leaned
closer
to
Alexander
,
squinting
up
at
him
from
the
deck
.

No
,
Cromwell
,
I
did
not
find
your
name
.

He
is
innocent
.

There
was
good
fortune
and
there
was
bad
and
Philip
Spencer
,
in
handcuffs
and
ankle
irons
,
knew
it
to
be
a
truth
.

But
he
could
not
have
done
so
,
could
not
have
found
the
way
,
had
fortune
favored
him
.

I
tell
you
he
is
innocent
.

And
do
you
think
there
is
a
reason
why
I
should
accept
your
word
?
?

The
boatswain
was
as
guilty
as
any
.

A
young
man
appeared
out
of
a
side
alley
and
walked
toward
us
with
quick
strides
.

Rachel
had
seen
me
watching
the
young
man
.

I
swallowed
hard
and
looked
down
at
my
feet
plodding
along
beside
Rachel
.

An
old
man
with
a
white
beard
and
dressed
in
a
long
shabby
coat
,
baggy
trousers
,
and
a
black
skullcap
greeted
us
.

Rachel
talked
to
him
.

He
nodded
,
clasping
and
unclasping
his
hands
over
his
paunch
,
and
flicked
glances
at
me
.

His
toes
pointed
out
toward
the
walls
.

He
stopped
in
front
of
a
door
,
placed
a
finger
on
his
lips
,
and
,
still
peering
down
into
his
beard
,
pushed
open
the
door
to
a
classroom
.

The
boys
were
tiny
.

The
teacher
plunged
the
children
into
a
new
portion
,
this
time
in
Hebrew
,
rapping
the
stick
incessantly
.

In
the
center
of
his
brilliant
curls
sat
a
small
black
skullcap
.

I
stared
at
him
for
a
long
time
.

Some
of
them
ignored
the
texts
and
had
apparently
memorized
the
words
long
ago
.

They
had
turned
numb
and
prickly
in
the
classroom
.

Rachel
said
,
He
asks
for
money
.

She
passed
by
him
.

Then
I
picked
it
up
again
and
handed
it
to
the
old
man
.

She
smiled
to
herself
.

You
had
to
have
convictions
to
lie
down
in
the
road
in
all
those
clothes
and
appear
as
though
you
might
wish
to
turn
yourself
out
of
your
own
home
.

You
had
to
be
stupid
or
crazy
or
immortal
.

She
said
,
Sometimes
I
think
they
are
keeping
religion
for
us
while
we
play
around
.

I
said
quietly
,
respectfully
,
What
did
she
do
here
?
?

But
when
she
saw
the
children
you
have
just
visited
,
she
wanted
to
take
them
away
and
put
them
out
in
the
country
,
in
the
kibbutzim
.

She
was
a
strange
woman
,
your
mother
.

But
she
loved
danger
.

It
was
an
impulse
when
she
was
here
in
Me'a
She'arim
--
I
was
with
her
--
that
led
her
to
stay
in
Israel
.

I'd
like
to
know
that
very
much
.

But
she
sighed
and
her
face
relaxed
.

There
was
a
refugee
who
was
able
to
come
here
because
of
her
.

Often
he
was
terribly
despondent
and
talked
to
no
one
.

Then
he
would
walk
off
for
a
few
days
alone
in
the
direction
of
Europe
.

All
his
family
was
dead
,
except
for
his
son
.

We
were
sitting
together
,
talking
.

No
one
saw
her
except
the
man
Reuveni
.

she
was
terribly
alone
.

And
I'll
take
you
with
me
.

But
now
the
dream
was
over
.

What
did
I
imagine
?
?

Or
maybe
poling
up
the
south
fork
of
the
Forked
Deer
River
braving
the
wastes
dumped
in
it
?
?

And
I'll
take
you
with
me
.

You
could
wish
that
.

And
every
sound
that
might
be
the
rain
also
might
be
the
man
who
thinks
after
he
has
raped
you
he
has
to
beat
your
brains
out
with
a
tire
tool
so
you
won't
tell
,
a
combination
like
ham
and
eggs
,
rape
her
and
kill
her
,
and
that
is
being
an
old
maid
too
.

For
you
don't
share
him
,
not
even
with
God
.

And
in
a
way
the
promise
works
out
true
,
for
whether
he
wants
you
or
not
,
you
go
with
him
in
your
heart
.

It
dawns
on
you
that
instead
of
a
lump
to
fill
the
seat
across
the
bridge
table
from
you
,
he
was
a
man
,
and
that
because
Gratt
Shafer
was
making
you
miserable
,
you
were
passing
it
down
to
him
,
to
Gratt
Shafer's
substitute
,
that
other
guy
.

And
you
wonder
if
that
is
why
the
little
man
lost
his
job
and
his
car
and
stayed
drunk
about
a
year
before
he
straightened
out
and
moved
to
St.
Louis
,
where
he
got
to
be
a
big
unhappy
success
.

The
bands
were
impatient
,
but
they
were
the
only
ones
.

You
were
sorry
when
he
finished
talking
because
while
he
was
up
there
you
were
someone
else
and
the
world
was
something
else
too
.

I
should
have
stayed
at
the
store
,
she
thought
.

There
was
no
lock
because
Herman
didn't
allow
a
lock
.

She
could
not
count
the
times
Herman
had
rapped
on
the
door
,
just
a
couple
of
bangs
that
shook
the
whole
damned
closet
and
might
,
someday
,
break
away
the
pipe
connections
from
the
wall
.

in
the
second
place
,
it
doesn't
look
authentic
;
;

They
know
from
their
researches
into
television
and
the
movies
that
knights
in
the
middle
ages
had
beautiful
flowing
haircuts
like
Little
Lord
Fauntleroy
,
and
only
the
villains
had
beards
.

In
the
end
,
I
did
the
same
old
picture
,
the
naked
girl
and
the
guy
in
the
doorway
,
only
I
put
a
Lord
Byron
shirt
on
the
guy
,
gave
him
a
sword
instead
of
a
pistol
,
and
painted
in
furniture
from
the
stills
of
a
costume
movie
.

We
all
painted
in
our
spare
time
,
and
we
had
all
started
as
easel
painters
with
scholarships
,
but
he
was
the
only
one
of
us
who
made
any
regular
money
at
it
.

It
was
all
gravy
,
and
Donald
didn't
need
much
to
live
on
;
;

This
set
his
tone
:
richness
of
texture
and
color
,
and
another
kind
of
richness
as
well
,
for
his
clothing
and
decorations
would
have
paid
the
Brush-off's
rent
for
a
year
.

Life
had
included
him
in
its
Modern
American
Artists
series
and
had
photographed
him
at
his
studio
in
the
East
Sixties
;
;

In
the
course
of
our
talk
,
Askington
mentioned
that
he
spent
part
of
each
week
studying
.

By
yourself
?
?

I
don't
think
I've
reached
the
point
,
yet
,
where
I
can
say
I
know
everything
I
ought
to
know
about
the
craft
.

The
artist
is
like
a
fragment
of
a
mosaic
--
no
,
he
is
more
than
that
,
a
virtuoso
performer
in
some
vast
philharmonic
.

I
am
studying
anatomy
with
Burns
,
he
replied
.

Still
painting
,
still
a
kind
of
modern
impressionist
,
beautiful
canvases
of
mountains
and
farms
.

He
even
makes
the
city
look
like
one
of
Thoreau's
hangouts
.

It
was
mostly
for
the
benefit
of
the
mailman
,
because
hardly
anybody
else
ever
visited
us
.

Partly
,
it
was
because
Pendleton
himself
wasn't
what
I
anticipated
.

Ida
,
where
is
the
car
license
?
?

Had
she
forgotten
she
had
signed
the
car
away
,
that
whatever
they
mutually
owned
had
been
divided
among
the
children
?
?

I
didn't
want
to
stir
things
up
.

She
must
have
taken
the
registration
when
she
went
to
Walter's
.

I
want
nothing
of
Via's
.

Had
she
been
in
such
a
turmoil
that
this
had
slipped
her
mind
?
?

I
was
so
sure
it
was
all
temporary
that
we
would
all
embrace
,
and
then
the
lawyer
would
tear
up
all
those
things

So
I
went
about
my
business
.

I
made
a
lemon
sponge
,
a
light
dessert
,
roasted
a
chicken
,
parboiled
some
frozen
vegetables
,
so
there
would
be
something
nice
in
the
icebox
for
the
weekend
.

I
have
these
appointments
in
town
for
Saturday
,
and
I'll
probably
spend
Sunday
with
Dolly
or
the
Thaxters
.

With
this
movie-to-be
in
London
,
and
new
faces
about
her
there
,
she
would
soon
be
a
more
tranquil
,
a
wiser
person
,
all
the
better
for
her
stay
out
here
.

I
felt
more
cheerful
,
as
if
I
had
had
a
part
in
bringing
her
through
to
a
greater
tolerance
of
herself
.

Even
at
a
car's
length
I
could
sense
that
something
was
wrong
,
and
so
I
followed
her
up
to
the
turnaround
in
front
of
the
house
.

And
then
I
remembered
a
few
years
before
after
their
return
from
a
short
trip
to
Rome
I
had
heard
her
boast
,
over
and
over
again
,
On
the
boat
people
liked
me
for
myself
.

Hanging
on
and
on
past
any
man's
patience
some
final
stab
of
conclusion
?
?

When
a
fisherman
brought
her
up
in
his
arms
,
still
,
small
,
as
if
she
were
a
child
asleep
,
I
began
to
shudder
with
a
terrible
excitement
,
almost
triumphant
,
that
I
still
cannot
account
for
.

That
at
last
the
vigilance
,
the
will
gives
way
?
?

Everyone
stared
at
me
and
drew
back
.

Their
eyes
turned
cold
and
accusing
,
even
Via's
.

And
they
have
never
changed
.

At
the
time
I
was
filled
with
self-pity
at
this
separation
,
but
in
the
years
since
I
have
come
to
understand
that
the
sight
of
me
was
painful
to
them
after
that
outcry
.

No
,
I
forget
Mrs.
Mathias
,
who
had
been
away
visiting
a
married
daughter
when
it
happened
.

She
haunted
me
;
;

Mr.
Salter
came
home
.

By
the
time
we
arrived
and
entered
the
building
sacred
music
was
already
swelling
out
into
the
chapel-like
auditorium
with
its
discreet
symbols
of
religious
faiths
.

I
had
a
rather
small
place
of
my
own
.

I
think
I
was
what
you
might
call
a
convivial
man
,
and
yet
it
was
when
I
was
alone
in
my
studio
,
doing
my
work
,
that
I
really
felt
alive
.

But
I
think
a
man
needs
at
least
one
intimate
friend
to
communicate
with
.

Did
you
make
friends
easily
?
?

What
is
this
?
?

She
asked
,
turning
suddenly
.

This
is
my
town
.

He
straightened
up
,
ready
to
vent
his
exasperation
,
then
grew
afraid
.

What's
the
matter
?
?

What's
the
matter
with
them
?
?

I
like
them
.

I'll
get
an
elegant
pair
of
thin-soled
Italian
shoes
tomorrow
,
Carla
.

Changing
his
clothes
,
he
put
on
his
dark-blue
flannel
suit
,
and
laid
away
the
gray
jacket
with
the
feeling
that
he
might
be
putting
it
aside
for
good
.

She
had
some
amusing
scandal
about
the
Farneses
in
the
old
days
.

Then
they
took
a
taxi
to
Trastevere
.

He
let
her
tell
him
all
about
the
church
.

Then
they
had
dinner
.

All
evening
she
was
eloquent
and
pleased
with
herself
.

Come
on
,
you'll
be
late
.

She
would
have
been
better
off
if
she
had
stuck
to
her
Bible
.

As
for
himself
,
he
just
didn't
have
the
temperament
for
it
.

Being
a
woman
though
,
she
would
take
only
what
she
needed
from
church
.

It
was
all
too
wearying
.

A
half
hour
later
he
got
her
up
to
go
out
for
breakfast
so
the
Ferraros
,
hearing
them
hurrying
down
the
stairs
,
would
think
they
were
going
to
a
late
mass
.

It
seemed
to
him
that
if
the
Ferraros
felt
sure
of
them
,
could
place
them
,
it
would
help
him
to
feel
more
sure
of
himself
with
Carla
.

And
he
waited
for
her
to
say
,
Oh
,
no
,
I
can
do
it
,
Sam
.

I
am
not
good
at
that
kind
of
thing
.

Watching
her
,
he
felt
like
a
spectator
at
a
tennis
game
,
with
the
ball
being
bounced
back
and
forth
.

Did
many
of
Sam's
countrymen
live
in
boxcars
in
the
bush
?
?

And
Sam
thanked
her
,
and
hoped
he
might
meet
her
nephew
back
home
,
and
asked
her
if
she
had
any
further
news
of
the
Pope
.

Yes
,
the
Pope
could
die
and
quickly
be
made
a
saint
.

Nodding
approvingly
and
swelling
with
importance
,
the
old
lady
whispered
confidentially
.

There
would
be
changes
made
,
and
Signor
Raymond
should
understand
that
when
the
Pope
died
it
was
like
the
end
of
a
regime
in
Rome
.

Jobs
would
be
lost
and
new
faces
would
become
prominent
.

But
one
night
Dookiyoon
moved
in
the
direction
of
the
women's
lodge
,
where
Shades
of
Night
had
gone
to
purify
herself
.

He
saw
her
emerge
suddenly
,
coming
in
her
unhesitant
fashion
,
her
back
stiff
,
her
head
erect
,
facing
with
contempt
the
night
and
whatever
she
would
encounter
,
as
if
in
her
extreme
disdain
and
indifference
she
would
pass
by
all
the
outraged
looks
of
those
whom
she
might
approach
.

In
her
dark
,
scornful
fashion
she
proceeded
to
her
destination
,
afraid
of
nothing
,
not
even
the
evil
spirits
which
kept
her
company
in
her
time
of
bleeding
.

Early
Spring
came
from
her
bed
,
from
beside
her
half-drunk
husband
,
Walitzee
,
and
stood
at
the
entrance
way
to
her
lodge
hearing
the
mild
commotion
,
the
sound
of
hushed
voices
.

But
the
girl
said
only
,
Tell
him
I
am
here
,
that
I
have
come
.

Telling
you
!
!

You
bring
only
wickedness
,
she
said
and
it
was
not
to
a
child
any
longer
but
to
another
woman
who
had
come
to
skirt
her
lodge
with
the
cunning
hunger
of
a
wild
animal
.

Go
take
helsq'iyokom
,
your
evil
spirit
,
to
the
young
boys
,
the
woman
said
.

Now
go
!
!

Drive
the
demons
out
of
her
and
teach
her
to
stay
away
from
my
husband
!
!

But
the
old
man
turned
on
her
,
jerking
the
whip
from
her
hand
.

Get
into
your
hovel
!
!

I
thought
I
dreamed
of
wolves
fighting
.

She
said
,
There
is
nothing
that
concerns
you
here
.

Lie
back
and
go
to
sleep
.

Do
not
let
the
wicked
spirits
enter
your
brain
.

She
said
to
him
,
her
father
,
How
was
I
begotten
,
in
pain
or
joy
?
?

The
sounds
of
an
animal
in
rage
and
despair
.

He
said
,
Let
me
take
her
blows
,
for
there
are
demons
in
me
too
.

Then
,
without
knowing
why
,
she
found
herself
running
from
them
,
fleeing
wildly
through
the
trees
,
dodging
her
own
shadows
until
she
came
to
a
little
hollow
in
the
rocky
ground
with
a
big
stone
in
the
center
behind
which
she
knelt
and
hid
,
listening
to
the
madness
of
her
heart
and
wanting
for
once
to
cry
.

But
they
could
taste
the
appeasement
of
violence
and
retribution
through
his
antics
.

They
went
into
the
sun
together
and
paraded
grandly
in
their
war
clothes
,
painting
their
faces
with
the
sacred
attis
dug
far
off
in
the
cave
of
skeletons
.

All
the
young
men
,
Alokut
among
them
,
challenged
them
in
matched
racing
.

They
raced
and
maneuvered
for
war
,
swinging
their
horses
in
single
file
and
then
abreast
like
cavalry
.

Walitzee
whitened
his
leggings
with
clay
,
knowing
the
girl
watched
from
her
place
in
the
trees
.

She
stood
,
once
more
listening
.

She
felt
as
if
some
dark
,
totally
unfamiliar
shape
would
clutch
at
her
arm
;
;

This
room
was
like
a
prison
.

He
shivered
,
and
then
tore
away
the
blood-soaked
parts
and
wound
the
rest
around
his
neck
like
a
scarf
.

He
found
a
lump
rising
in
his
throat
because
of
that
one
simple
act
of
tidiness
.

Alex
Poldowski
--
in
a
fashion
he
owed
a
debt
to
that
effete
gentleman
.

At
least
Alex
had
told
him
he
wasn't
dying
.

Strange
,
it
was
still
running
.

A
quarter
to
seven
.

He
was
kneeling
to
tie
his
shoelaces
.

He'd
have
to
think
,
but
the
main
thing
,
the
imperative
necessity
,
was
to
leave
before
Sam
Bentley
was
up
and
about
,
and
before
Millie
detained
him
with
sympathy
.

Who's
there
?
?

For
a
moment
he
felt
like
a
thief
discovered
.

He
was
trying
to
smile
at
her
.

I
am
just
finishing
breakfast
.

He
leaned
his
head
against
the
wood
paneling
behind
him
,
but
the
vivid
red
images
of
pain
inserted
themselves
against
his
eyelids
.

I
have
to
say
good-bye
upstairs
.

As
a
great
favor
,
Julie
,
he
said
,
please
don't
mention
you've
seen
me
.

I'll
call
your
mother
as
soon
as
I
get
home
.

Outside
the
Lincoln
was
parked
.

but
that
didn't
matter
.

He
had
never
felt
particularly
close
to
her
.

That's
in
the
opposite
direction
.

I
wish
I
wasn't
wearing
this
ridiculous
costume
,
and
that
we
could
go
to
a
theater
together
,
or
a
nice
restaurant
,
forget
we
knew
He
stopped
speaking
.

Yes
,
perhaps
.

Are
you
positive
you'll
be
all
right
by
yourself
?
?

Take
care
of
yourself
then
.

No
,
please
--
no
visit
today
--
I'll
be
asleep
.

There
was
one
more
call
to
make
.

Look
,
sweetheart
,
some
fool
was
.

I'd
win
hands
down
.

I'll
take
you
out
to
dinner
.

She
lived
alone
in
the
older
part
of
the
city
,
in
one
of
those
renovated
houses
whose
brick
facade
some
early
settler
had
constructed
.

Remember
what
happened
the
last
time
?
?

but
she
had
stayed
all
winter
,
and
Cathy
had
stayed
all
winter
too
--
with
them
.

But
she
promised
--
This
will
be
different
,
he
said
at
last
.

Remembering
that
succession
of
disasters
,
she
now
considered
Cathy
,
an
ominous
child-cloud
on
her
horizon
.

Myra
loved
big
cities
;
;

Lucy
knew
her
too
well
to
find
it
impossible
.

Jim
was
so
indignant
it
was
obvious
that
no
matter
what
he
said
,
he
too
had
seen
the
looming
specter
of
a
forever-Cathy
.

There
isn't
a
chance
of
Myra's
letting
anything
like
that
happen
.

The
only
thing
that
had
ever
come
between
them
was
that
worthless
,
selfish
sister
of
his
.

Do
you
need
that
big
bundle
?
?

Susan
stared
at
him
with
hurt
blue
eyes
that
gushed
an
instant
grief
;
;

And
when
you
get
back
from
Grandma's
,
Cathy
will
be
here
to
play
with
you
.

That
was
one
more
reason
she
didn't
look
forward
to
Cathy's
visit
,
short
or
long
;
;

the
sly
female
cowbirds
took
instant
advantage
of
nests
without
sentinels
.

Well
,
Lucy
?
?

She
said
to
herself
,
abandoning
the
cardinals
and
the
cowbirds
.

among
them
,
she
had
to
prepare
the
guest
room
.

As
long
as
the
unscrupulous
Myra
chose
?
?

A
row
of
little
hangers
waited
for
a
child's
clothes
in
the
neatly
empty
closet
;
;

since
Myra
had
always
put
most
of
Greg's
money
on
her
own
back
,
Lucy
suspected
that
no
more
than
a
few
of
that
long
row
would
be
needed
.

Out
in
the
hall
,
the
upstairs
phone
shrilled
,
and
the
small
ghost
vanished
.

I
just
thought
I'd
let
you
know
.

I'd
have
phoned
sooner
but
I've
been
busy
.

You
could
think
yourself
as
grown
up
as
Methuselah
,
yet
the
maternal
voice
still
kept
its
comforting
magic
.

Just
for
a
couple
of
weeks
,
till
Myra
finds
a
place
for
them
.

her
mother
was
forthright
;
;

Again
there
was
that
curious
pause
,
and
then
her
mother
said
,
I
guess
I
do
.

Then
she
jumped
to
her
feet
,
the
elastic
phone
cord
uncoiling
like
a
black
snake
.

Myra
had
no
intention
whatever
of
sending
for
Cathy
in
two
weeks
.

For
a
moment
,
anger
darkened
the
hallway
about
her
,
and
when
she
found
her
voice
,
anger
thickened
it
.

That
does
it
!
!

As
she
hung
up
,
she
saw
through
the
hall's
open
window
the
purple-black
flying
of
the
cowbirds'
wings
,
and
heard
their
grotesque
singing
.

She
opened
the
door
.

Quint
couldn't
blame
Maggie
for
disbelieving
.

For
eleven
days
they'd
done
the
same
thing
,
leaving
the
cottage
quietly
before
breakfast
,
before
Esperanza
Beach
got
jammed
with
tourists
and
beach
balls
and
show-offy
lifeguards
.

The
swirling
sand
made
Quint's
limp
more
pronounced
.

They
walked
slowly
past
the
sherbet-colored
cottages
--
eleven
lemon
,
nine
mint
,
seven
orange
--
around
the
curve
to
a
deserted
stand
with
an
Eats
sign
jiggling
in
the
wind
.

Here
he
was
enclosed
and
safe
.

A
dark
bathroom
can
be
pretty
scary
,
and
he'd
creep
back
to
bed
,
proud
of
himself
,
thinking
:
Tomorrow
,
for
sure
,
I'll
go
down
to
the
rock
and
keep
my
promise
to
Dad
.

He
says
you
are
limping
more
than
you
need
to
.

When
you
get
back
I'll
probly
be
swimming
better
than
Victoria
.

Wait
and
see
,
Dad
.

He
called
her
Fatso
.

Or
,
what
was
worse
,
she
prayed
for
him
out
loud
at
bedtime
:
Please
,
Lord
Gord
,
please
give
my
brother
the
strength
to
go
swimming
like
he
promised
.

The
wind
bored
a
hole
between
his
shoulder
blades
,
and
when
he
looked
at
the
choppy
waves
coming
and
going
and
crossing
each
other
he
could
see
his
head
down
there
,
bleeding
,
wedged
between
the
rocks
and
the
waves
.

I
am
scared
of
the
nightmare
.

They
started
with
the
Kansas-Nebraska
Bill
of
eighteen
--

Mister
Big
Britches
,
aren't
you
?
?

I
said
Quint
.

If
I
was
your
mama
,
I'd
wop
your
tail
off
.

She
seemed
so
unimpressed
that
he
was
obliged
to
roll
up
his
blue
jeans
so
she
could
see
his
brace
.

Or
say
a
waiter
brings
you
a
bowl
of
soup
with
a
dead
fly
in
it
--
all
you
got
to
do
is
bannnnnng
,
stooooomp
your
cane
on
the
floor
.

Holy
mackerel
,
that's
the
most
unique
dog
I
ever
saw
,
she
said
firmly
.

He's
been
sick
lately
.

Come
home
or
I'll
come
find
you
.

Even
though
this
is
my
rock
,
you
can
use
it
sometimes
.

I
come
early
in
the
morning
.

Her
name
was
Sabella
,
and
the
strip
of
seaweed
around
her
neck
was
an
emerald
necklace
the
King
gave
her
as
a
token
of
his
undying
love
.

You
going
to
marry
the
King
?
?

My
hair
is
what
he's
nuts
about
.

Naturally
curly
hair
runs
in
my
family
.

As
for
dancing
--
holy
mackerel
,
he
ought
to
see
the
gypsies
in
Jerez
;
;

She
made
better
pictures
than
any
book
he'd
read
,
but
he
didn't
say
so
.

)
Encouraged
by
her
giggles
he
imitated
Maggie
who
was
crazy
about
ham
.

He
snuck
up
on
the
ham
like
Maggie
,
gumming
it
with
soft
,
stumpy
teeth
,
then
panting
with
thirst
,
lapping
up
the
water
in
the
lagoon
,
swelling
up
like
a
balloon
,
staggering
home
to
be
sick
,
while
his
mother
said
,
That
does
it
.

Better
make
up
your
mind
,
son
,
Sabella
said
.

Thank
you
,
Quint
.

Her
face
turned
pink
with
pleasure
and
a
smothered
cough
.

Once
when
she
asked
why
he
never
went
swimming
and
he
answered
,
Don't
feel
like
it
,
he
was
tempted
to
tell
her
about
being
scared
.

It
had
started
two
years
ago
when
he
was
in
an
iron
lung
.

When
Bobbie
Evans
smashed
up
his
car
,
the
Jaguar
his
wife
Linda
had
given
him
for
his
last
birthday
,
and
himself
quite
thoroughly
with
it
,
driving
back
from
an
afternoon's
golf
at
Oakmont
,
it
seemed
to
mark
the
end
of
a
long
,
miswritten
chapter
in
the
social
life
of
the
community
.

Hadn't
Linda
been
a
perfect
wife
to
Bobbie
,
who
was
the
least
bit
of
a
disappointment
all
these
years
?
?

Wasn't
it
adult
and
realistic
to
look
at
it
that
way
?
?

Then
there
was
a
spat
over
something
,
as
there
had
been
lovers'
spats
before
;
;

Mousie
Chandler
had
been
to
school
with
her
someplace
near
Baltimore
and
tried
to
explain
rather
than
defend
her
to
the
gang
having
lunch
at
Horne's
.

As
if
he
were
choking
,
she
said
.

Her
hair
never
seemed
to
be
in
place
and
her
skirts
were
never
quite
the
correct
length
.

She
didn't
have
a
bad
shape
when
you
caught
her
at
the
pool
at
Longue
Vue
,
but
her
bathing
suits
were
far
from
smart
.

And
you
didn't
see
her
much
at
Longue
Vue
or
anywhere
,
for
John
had
drifted
away
from
the
gang
.

John
was
good
at
his
job
.

Being
an
intelligent
man
,
John
must
have
guessed
what
everyone
thought
about
Edythe
,
but
he
never
let
on
by
so
much
as
a
brave
smile
.

Bobbie
had
been
successful
,
too
,
though
he
didn't
match
John's
pace
,
and
after
all
he
didn't
need
to
,
with
all
the
Stuart
money
.

And
then
came
the
hairpin
turn
,
the
smashed
Jaguar
and
Linda
,
mourning
alone
and
lovely
.

It
was
up
to
her
to
save
Poor
John
,
dear
John
,
to
undo
the
wrong
she
had
done
,
but
she
trembled
at
the
decision
as
at
the
brink
of
a
cold
stream
.

Linda
would
have
to
wait
,
she
knew
.

Of
course
,
he
had
done
wonders
.

Bobbie
had
been
head
of
the
alloy
division
,
while
John
was
just
another
good
salesman
in
the
regular
branch
.

For
Linda
knew
how
to
help
her
husband
,
not
just
the
Stuart-family
contacts
but
also
the
little
dinners
for
Reuben
Lovejoy
.

Linda
dragooned
her
uncle
,
Donald
Murkland
,
into
a
lunch
the
next
day
to
find
out
what
had
happened
.

Bobbie
will
take
the
job
as
his
just
reward
and
work
hard
at
it
;
;

Poor
John
will
take
it
as
a
miracle
and
have
every
other
independent
steel
company
sitting
up
nights
worrying
about
us
.

The
job
at
Funk
wasn't
particularly
better
,
but
it
got
him
away
from
being
subordinate
to
John
and
assured
him
steady
advancement
,
since
Funk
was
owned
to
a
large
degree
by
various
branches
of
Linda's
family
.

She
called
then
to
say
she
had
a
baby-sitter
for
that
night
.

I
answered
to
find
Nadine
at
the
other
end
.

Oh
,
she
wouldn't
do
that
,
I
said
.

Janice
,
could
you
possibly
go
over
and
make
sure
everything's
all
right
?
?

I'll
call
you
there
in
ten
minutes
--

I
can't
make
it
in
ten
minutes
--
Wondering
,
as
I
said
it
,
why
I
should
make
it
at
all
.

I'll
be
glad
to
pay
you
--

And
Nadine
insisted
that
her
sitters
be
reliable
!
!

I
have
to
get
up
early
for
church
tomorrow
,
she
went
on
.

There
was
a
ragged
edge
to
her
voice
now
,
as
if
she'd
been
crying
.

The
receiver
clicked
in
my
ear
.

She
didn't
even
give
me
a
chance
to
refuse
.

So
I
told
her
Mrs.
Roberts
would
pay
her
in
the
morning
,
and
she
scooted
off
to
her
own
apartment
.

Nadine's
,
shrill
with
anger
--
Wally's
loud
and
thick
--
As
I
went
to
the
door
I
heard
the
clock
strike
two
.

I
opened
the
door
,
and
Wally
stumbled
in
--
fast
--
as
if
Nadine
had
pushed
him
.

We
are
ruined
and
he's
going
to
get
out
if
I
have
to
throw
him
down
the
stairs
--

you'd
better
simmer
down
,
I
said
nervously
.

Now
you
just
take
it
easy
,
and
I'll
make
you
some
tea
--

How
can
you
be
so
damn
stupid
?
?

Ken
will
never
forgive
him
--
never
!
!

You'll
wake
up
the
whole
building
.

In
the
morning
you
and
Wally
can
talk
things
out
--

I
got
her
into
bed
,
and
sat
with
her
until
she
had
sobbed
herself
out
.

I
left
her
,
a
limp
bundle
of
self-pity
,
shivering
with
terror
because
her
bubble
had
burst
around
her
.

But
Ken
got
coy
and
wouldn't
make
any
promises
.

But
she
was
beyond
caring
what
she
said
.

But
I
couldn't
help
thinking
that
Nadine
and
Wally
were
getting
just
what
they
deserved
.

They
had
not
only
spent
every
cent
--
they
were
in
debt
up
to
their
necks
,
owing
on
everything
they
owned
.

I
said
I
wished
we
were
,
too
.

It
was
easy
enough
to
say
it
,
because
of
course
we
couldn't
spare
a
cent
.

Well
,
now
she
can
sleep
in
the
street
for
all
I
care
!
!

To
my
way
of
thinking
,
he
was
scared
sick
.

While
I
worked
,
Nadine
sat
and
cried
.

But
it
couldn't
go
on
forever
--
A
couple
of
weeks
,
Chris
had
said
.

He
set
out
every
morning
looking
for
work
,
and
come
home
around
noon
,
full
of
alibis
and
excuses
.

Wendell
Thom
had
black-balled
him
.

You
can
get
a
job
working
in
a
grocery
store
,
if
nothing
else
.

It
was
just
going
to
be
one
of
those
days
.

For
the
thousandth
time
,
I
wished
I'd
chosen
some
nice
,
nine-to-five
,
five-days-a-week
profession
.

I
was
lucky
in
lots
of
ways
,
no
doubt
about
it
.

Growing
up
without
a
mother
from
the
time
she
was
three
--
it
wasn't
a
good
thing
for
a
child
,
even
knowing
the
kind
of
mother
Alice
had
been
.

But
I
mustn't
start
on
Alice
.

As
usual
,
Gladdy's
bright
smile
greeted
me
at
the
breakfast
table
.

If
she
and
Pete
were
really
getting
serious
,
I'd
have
to
do
some
hard
thinking
.

Should
I
tell
him
the
truth
about
Alice
?
?

Pete
was
down
on
Seven
,
Dick
told
me
,
and
he'd
meet
us
there
.

It
was
thought
wiser
to
keep
them
segregated
from
the
patients
in
the
regular
charity
ward
.

The
moment
I
walked
in
,
the
whole
miserable
feeling
of
the
day
seemed
to
focus
on
the
woman
in
the
bed
.

I
looked
at
the
chart
for
reassurance
.

She
looked
about
sixty
,
though
I
recalled
that
the
chart
gave
her
age
as
forty-four
.

An
ugly
scar
disfigured
the
somewhat
familiar
puffy
face
,
already
marred
by
the
tell-tale
network
of
broken
red
veins
that
heavy
drinkers
carry
.

No
,
no
it
was
an
unfortunate
resemblance
,
that
was
all
it
was
,
and
I
turned
to
Dick
,
forcing
myself
to
put
my
disquiet
out
of
my
mind
.

In
a
low
voice
,
Dick
filled
us
in

I
tell
you
,
it
took
every
ounce
of
control
I
had
to
be
able
to
speak
.

This
was
one
time
I'd
have
gladly
broken
my
own
rule
,
but
habit
was
too
strong
.

Have
you
spoken
to
a
doctor
about
it
?
?

I
told
Miss
Groggins
to
move
her
down
the
hall
where
we
had
an
examining
table
.

Pete
stood
by
with
a
slide
and
took
the
smear
,
sent
it
down
to
the
lab
with
a
request
for
the
test
.

One
of
my
private
patients
was
being
admitted
and
I
went
in
to
see
her
settled
.

On
my
way
to
the
elevator
,
I
ran
into
Pete
.

Maybe
it's
nothing
,
maybe
it's
intraepithelial
or
in
situ
--
can't
take
any
chances
.

Wants
to
get
to
her
booze
,
I
guess
.

I
grimaced
in
distaste
.

We'd
been
standing
right
outside
Miss
Bancroft's
door
and
as
I
went
to
turn
the
knob
to
enter
,
I
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
door
was
slightly
ajar
.

I
just
got
through
seeing
one
of
you
guys
.

There
was
something
almost
insulting
in
her
tone
,
but
I
disregarded
it
.

But
we
would
like
your
permission
to
do
--
that
is
,
to
go
further
if
it
proves
necessary
.

I
looked
at
her
in
amazement
.

She
smiled
,
a
smile
without
humor
.

I
am
not
going
to
be
one
of
your
guinea
pigs
.

I
don't
know
what
you
heard
that
would
make
you
think
so
,
but
I
assure
you
I
don't
even
know
myself
,
so
how
can
you
be
so
sure
?
?

And
even
if
--

I
gaped
at
her
.

Guess
I've
changed
,
haven't
I
?
?

Alice
--
I
stammered
through
dry
lips
.

The
last
thing
I
remember
is
a
bar
in
San
Diego
--

I
looked
at
the
pathetic
wreck
of
a
woman
before
me
.

If
I
let
her
go
,
she'd
disappear
once
more
.

the
many
little
tricks
she
knew
made
her
embrace
the
ultimate
one
--
the
ever
more
fantastic
pressures
deeper
in
her
body
squeezed
not
me
but
the
air
I
breathed
into
a
nitrogen
anesthetic
.

Only
the
dive
itself
had
any
meaning
.

While
a
hazy
part
of
my
mind
concentrated
on
swimming
down
,
a
clear
part
sorted
over
recent
events
,
among
them
my
only
positive
act
in
a
long
time
.

Wild
kicks
never
are
,
but
I
hoped
to
dig
up
a
better
frame
of
mind
.

That
first
time
was
good
and
it
stuck
with
me
.

And
so
off
we
went
to
her
apartment
.

Now
it
was
nine
years
later
,
and
it
wasn't
spring
but
winter
when
I
returned
.

I
got
there
on
a
Saturday
evening
.

The
place
was
busy
but
I
didn't
feel
like
a
Hun
.

All
that
day
and
Monday
I
drank
just
enough
to
orbit
but
not
make
deep
space
.

My
head
was
clear
,
my
thinking
sober
and
I
was
reconciled
to
this
Paris
idea
as
a
flop
on
top
of
all
my
others
.

A
good
binge
has
that
kind
of
therapeutic
value
.

Sometime
earlier
the
weather
had
turned
cold
and
it
was
snowing
.

I
went
out
into
it
.

I
walked
around
breathing
the
cold
wine
of
the
air
until
I
found
a
park
,
and
I
sat
down
on
a
snowy
bench
where
the
light
was
dim
and
came
from
the
sky
.

I
was
just
miserable
.

Pretty
soon
a
woman
came
along
carrying
a
folded
umbrella
as
a
walking
stick
.

It
gave
her
poise
and
posture
.

It
gave
her
propriety
.

(
I
didn't
have
on
a
hat
.

She
must
have
seen
the
ring
on
my
left
hand
.

Ah
,
Monsieur
,
it
is
not
my
business
to
wager
it
.

This
took
me
so
funny
I
had
to
look
at
her
.

I
could
see
she
was
shocked
.

Non
,
non
,
she
said
,
taking
the
bottle
,
not
for
that
be
sorry
.

She
tilted
up
and
drank
,
and
then
I
drank
.

Not
good
looking
,
but
self-confident
and
wise
so
that
it
made
her
attractive
.

We
seemed
to
be
drowsing
,
sadly
,
soberly
,
in
the
cold
,
cold
air
while
the
snow
fell
.

I
felt
wonderful
,
the
absolute
opposite
of
last
night's
melancholy
.

I
was
hungry
as
a
wolf
,
and
my
body
felt
lean
and
vital
.

She
looked
good
,
with
her
short
tousled
hair
and
no
make-up
.

J'ai
faim
!
!

The
toothbrush
Monsieur
,
he
said
,
presenting
it
.

I
gave
it
to
the
woman
.

I
said
with
round
eyes
.

The
coffee
wasn't
very
hot
though
,
made
in
a
filter
pot
,
but
it
was
good
.

We
sent
the
waiter
away
and
ate
a
tremendous
amount
of
cold
ham
,
hot
hard-boiled
eggs
and
hot
garlic
bread
.

Um
?
?

Yes
,
because
you
didn't
run
off
to
use
that
new
toothbrush
.

I
know
men
never
kiss
les
putains
.

We
were
not
rushed
.

What
is
this
from
?
?

A
bullet
,
she
answered
.

She
would
not
stop
to
read
them
in
American
Express
,
as
many
were
doing
,
sitting
on
benches
or
leaning
against
the
walls
,
but
pushed
her
way
out
into
the
street
.

An
enormous
sky
of
the
most
delicate
blue
arched
overhead
.

She
would
see
them
,
looking
just
as
they
had
in
the
books
,
and
this
would
make
up
a
part
of
her
delight
.

Cars
,
taxis
,
buses
,
and
motorscooters
all
went
plunging
at
once
down
the
narrow
length
of
it
or
swerving
perilously
around
a
fountain
.

Something
special
was
going
on
here
just
now
--
the
annual
display
of
azalea
plants
.

She
had
heard
about
it
the
night
before
at
her
hotel
.

Theresa
sat
with
her
letters
in
her
lap
,
breathing
Mediterranean
air
.

Somebody
had
scrawled
American
Express
,
Piazza
di
Spagna
?
?

,
across
the
envelope
,
and
now
Theresa
had
it
,
all
as
easily
as
if
she
had
been
the
President
of
the
Republic
or
the
Pope
.

His
own
children
had
suffered
from
the
weakening
of
those
values
which
he
and
Theresa
had
always
taken
for
granted
,
and
as
for
his
grandchildren
(
he
had
one
so
far
,
still
in
diapers
)
,
he
shuddered
to
think
that
the
true
meaning
of
character
might
never
dawn
on
them
at
all
.

They
all
surrounded
him
,
the
family
circle
,
Theresa
and
George
as
solemn
as
if
they
were
watching
the
cat
have
kittens
,
and
Cousin
Emma
running
back
and
forth
with
a
kettle
of
hot
water
which
she
poured
steaming
into
a
white
enamelled
pan
.

Now
,
here
they
both
were
,
still
the
same
,
George
full
of
round-eyed
woe
,
and
Cousin
Emma
in
despair
.

But
there
is
more
in
this
than
meets
the
eye
.

A
new
bathroom
would
certainly
have
to
be
put
in
.

The
wallpaper
in
the
back
bedroom
is
literally
crumbling
off
.

(
Theresa
skipped
a
page
of
details
about
the
house
.

I'll
start
sneezing
in
a
minute
,
sitting
on
these
cold
steps
.

Yet
here
they
were
obviously
thought
to
be
handsome
,
and
felt
themselves
to
be
so
.

Theresa
turned
away
to
escape
,
and
climbed
to
a
higher
landing
where
the
steps
divided
in
two
.

She
cast
about
as
though
looking
for
a
policeman
:
this
really
shouldn't
be
allowed
!
!

Theresa
Stubblefield
,
still
holding
the
family
letters
in
one
hand
,
realized
that
her
whole
trip
to
Europe
was
viewed
in
family
circles
as
an
interlude
between
Cousin
Elec's
death
and
doing
something
about
Cousin
Emma
.

The
trouble
is
,
Theresa
thought
,
that
while
everything
that
happens
there
is
supposed
to
matter
supremely
,
nothing
here
is
supposed
even
to
exist
.

They
would
not
care
if
all
of
Europe
were
to
sink
into
the
ocean
tomorrow
.

She
became
aware
that
two
Italian
workmen
,
carrying
a
large
azalea
pot
,
were
standing
before
her
and
wanted
her
to
move
so
that
they
could
begin
arranging
a
new
row
of
the
display
.

She
indicated
a
spot
a
little
distance
away
.

I
knew
it
as
surely
as
everybody
in
Westfield
--
that
Lucille
was
a
husband
stealer
.

Just
as
it
has
its
Susan
Dolan
,
though
nobody'd
ever
bothered
to
tell
me
that
.

They
were
good-living
religious
people
,
and
I
can
truthfully
say
I
never
heard
them
spread
any
gossip
about
anybody
.

Even
if
they
ever
did
say
anything
about
people
like
Lucille
Warren
,
I
know
they
wouldn't
have
dreamed
of
saying
it
in
front
of
me
.

I
asked
him
about
it
one
night
while
we
were
sitting
in
his
truck
.

My
love
for
Johnnie
was
young
and
clean
--
how
could
I
possibly
compete
with
a
woman
like
that
,
who
didn't
hesitate
to
use
her
sex
.

Johnnie
was
a
trucker
with
a
small
lumber
outfit
in
a
town
about
twenty
miles
away
,
and
he
was
also
pretty
good
at
anything
in
the
carpentry
line
.

I
wasn't
in
the
habit
of
batting
my
eyes
at
delivery
men
,
but
the
moment
I
saw
Johnnie
,
I
knew
he
was
different
.

He
wasn't
only
different
--
he
was
it
.

And
now
Lucille
Warren
had
gotten
a
look
at
him
.

She
wouldn't
have
,
even
if
he'd
asked
her
.

And
he
wouldn't
leave
her
either
--
he'd
told
me
that
.

And
you
fall
for
a
lumber
jockey
.

Don't
you
dare
.

And
never
show
my
face
or
my
truck
around
here
again
.

He
still
wasn't
looking
at
me
.

I
might
.

But
what
had
I
done
,
trying
to
keep
us
pure
?
?

I
wanted
him
,
with
a
terrifying
fierceness
.

It
can't
be
wrong
,
can
it
?
?

I
took
great
comfort
from
his
words
,
and
smiled
to
myself
in
the
darkness
.

Idiot's
delight
,
I
later
discovered
.

I
felt
no
conflict
between
what
I
was
doing
and
my
strict
religious
upbringing
.

I
had
also
thought
a
lot
about
how
God
must
look
on
true
love
,
and
so
in
a
way
I
was
keeping
my
promise
to
God
,
my
promise
to
remain
pure
until
I
was
married
.

It
wasn't
Johnnie's
fault
that
he
was
hopelessly
tied
down
to
that
frightful
woman
who
did
her
best
to
make
his
life
unbearable
.

No
price
is
too
high
when
true
love
is
at
stake
.

She'd
have
gotten
him
,
if
I
hadn't
stopped
her
.

After
all
,
Lucille
Warren
was
a
husband-stealer
from
way
back
.

From
the
entire
eastern
half
of
the
nation
they'd
be
coming
,
members
of
the
Young
Christians'
League
,
and
I'd
been
chosen
to
represent
our
chapter
.

The
first
meeting
was
held
in
Faneuil
Hall
,
a
great
big
place
where
we
were
able
to
meet
members
from
all
the
other
states
.

I
thought
so
,
and
he
mentioned
it
,
and
Alma
said
so
too
.

Outside
the
hall
,
I
anxiously
looked
around
for
her
,
then
all
at
once
there
was
a
hand
on
my
elbow
.

A
couple
of
the
girls
were
laughing
rather
shrilly
and
I
realized
they
were
drinking
.

My
folks
wouldn't
dream
of
having
alcohol
in
the
house
,
so
my
first
taste
of
it
had
been
--
of
course
--
with
Johnnie
.

I
don't
see
Alma
anywhere
,
I
said
.

Not
for
me
.

Under
normal
circumstances
,
he
had
a
certain
bright-eyed
all-American-boy
charm
,
with
great
appeal
for
young
ladies
,
old
ladies
,
and
dogs
.

Share
bath
,
maybe
--
but
share
refrigerator
?
?

He
remembered
seeing
it
last
night
,
when
he
put
away
his
small
store
of
bachelor-type
eatables
.

Charlie
downed
his
orange
juice
and
one
of
the
long
,
skinny
green
pills
,
his
spirits
as
damp
as
the
day
.

Take
a
full
month
,
the
doctor
had
said
.

This
is
a
sleeping
capsule
.

You
young
men
get
to
be
my
age
,
you
won't
take
flu
so
lightly
.

The
doctor
could
call
it
anything
from
flu
to
beriberi
;
;

He
had
caught
,
too
,
like
an
ailment
,
a
confirmed
distrust
of
women
.

In
these
damp
circumstances
,
he
was
an
odds-on
bet
to
develop
pneumonia
.

Three-day
blow
!
!

He
could
imagine
her
at
this
minute
,
honeymooning
in
Nassau
with
what's-his-name
,
lounging
on
golden
sands
,
looking
forward
to
a
life
of
unalloyed
bliss
.

All
Charlie
could
look
forward
to
was
a
yellow
pill
at
noon
,
a
salami
sandwich
for
lunch
,
and
a
lonely
old
age
--
if
he
lived
that
long
.

He
thought
about
it
for
a
minute
,
could
find
no
reasonable
explanation
for
the
presence
of
a
sweater
in
the
refrigerator
,
got
the
salami
,
bread
,
and
a
Bermuda
onion
,
and
put
the
whole
thing
out
of
his
mind
.

Next
morning
,
he
found
a
note
in
the
refrigerator
.

The
smell
permeates
everything
!
!

Not
onions
,
came
the
answer
the
following
day
.

Pink
,
Vivian
once
had
told
him
,
was
for
baby
girls
,
and
grown-up
girls
who
wore
pink
were
subconsciously
clinging
to
their
infancy
.

Be
a
scorcher
by
afternoon
.

I
hope
so
.

Charlie
looked
in
the
mirror
.

He
got
a
red
pill
and
a
beer
and
then
,
on
impulse
,
transferred
the
rest
of
his
salami
to
her
side
of
the
refrigerator
and
scrawled
Be
my
guest
on
the
wrapping
.

It
gave
him
a
good
feeling
.

I've
got
this
cold
,
he
wrote
.

I
mean
,
she's
still
living
,
and
she's
ninety-six
.

By
the
next
morning
,
she
had
turned
the
paper
over
.

Gee
,
neither
do
I
.

She
didn't
sound
like
a
pale
girl
.

She
sounded
a
little
like
a
redhead
.

She's
got
browny
hair
.

Finally
,
in
desperation
,
he
opened
the
refrigerator
,
filched
her
hand
lotion
,
and
left
a
note
.

Now
Vivian
,
for
instance
,
was
not
too
long
on
sympathy
.

He
didn't
know
what
was
so
tough
about
Vivian's
world
,
slopping
around
Nassau
with
what's-his-name
.

Correspondence
passed
back
and
forth
.

The
only
thing
,
this
lotion
has
glycerin
in
it
,
and
that
whitens
the
skin
,
so
if
you
are
so
anxious
to
get
a
tan
,
you
may
not
want
to
use
it
.

Do
you
have
anything
to
read
while
you
are
shut
up
?
?

but
the
picture
of
Tom
Swift
is
pretty
sinister
.

Eddie
Lee
,
Riverside's
redheaded
playing
manager
,
ran
after
the
ball
but
it
rolled
past
him
.

Eddie
caught
up
with
the
ball
near
the
fence
and
threw
it
to
Phil
.

Mike
caught
the
ball
just
as
the
catcher
slid
into
the
bag
.

The
Anniston
catcher
screamed
.

Phil
Rossoff
,
coming
in
from
left
field
,
stopped
at
the
water
fountain
for
a
drink
.

Mike
Deegan
was
standing
beside
it
,
facing
the
field
.

Maybe
the
answer
was
in
his
eyes
.

By
the
time
the
fielder
got
his
hands
on
the
ball
Deegan
was
rounding
third
base
and
heading
for
home
.

The
left
fielder
threw
and
it
was
a
good
one
.

But
Mike
had
no
chance
of
being
tagged
.

Both
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
.

They
poured
water
over
their
catcher's
face
.

Then
,
quickly
,
and
a
little
nervously
,
the
doctor
ordered
a
couple
of
ballplayers
to
carry
the
catcher
into
the
dressing
room
.

Mike
sat
quietly
watching
the
manager
come
nearer
.

No
one
said
a
word
.

That
was
a
rotten
thing
to
do
.

For
God's
sake
,
Mike
said
,
waving
the
manager
away
.

Stop
it
,
will
you
?
?

Everyone
in
the
ball
park
seemed
to
be
standing
and
shouting
.

He
arose
slowly
and
brushed
himself
off
.

Listen
!
!

Mike
Deegan
pounded
the
rubber
plate
with
the
end
of
his
bat
.

Phil
Rossoff
and
two
other
Riverside
players
did
not
go
out
on
the
field
when
the
fighting
started
.

Mike
went
over
to
Phil
and
stood
over
him
.

You
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
.

You
trying
to
say
I
started
the
fight
?
?

He
sat
down
before
Eddie's
desk
.

I
am
doing
you
a
favor
,
Eddie
said
quickly
.

Sit
down
,
sit
down
,
Eddie
said
.

I
am
not
saying
you
are
yellow
.

I
am
not
steering
you
wrong
.

Dazed
,
Phil
said
:
I
don't
get
it
.

What
difference
does
your
batting
average
make
?
?

Or
even
the
way
you
run
bases
.

What
the
hell
do
you
think
baseball
is
?
?

It's
a
way
of
life
,
goddamit
!
!

Phil
shut
the
door
behind
him
.

What
happened
?
?

You
crazy
?
?

I
don't
know
,
Phil
said
.

Phil
started
to
take
his
clothes
off
and
Frankie
sat
down
on
the
bench
again
.

Phil
did
not
answer
.

Why
not
try
another
club
?
?

What
the
hell
right
did
Eddie
have
saying
a
thing
like
that
?
?

Springfield's
in
tomorrow
,
Frankie
said
.

Talk
to
Whitey
Jackson
.

Ask
Whitey
for
a
job
.

Atta
boy
.

That's
the
way
to
talk
.

He
was
enormously
happy
with
her
gift
and
smiled
,
then
went
to
his
room
to
read
.

Through
quiet
laughter
his
mother
said
,
Don't
speak
to
your
father
like
that
,
Richard
.

She
seemed
to
work
to
grow
close
to
her
son
in
the
few
days
he
spent
at
home
,
talking
to
him
about
some
of
the
more
pleasant
moments
of
his
childhood
and
then
trying
to
talk
to
him
about
those
things
in
which
he
alone
was
interested
.

Richard
left
America
with
his
clothes
,
his
biwa
and
his
image
of
Acala
and
,
on
the
freighter
which
took
him
to
Japan
,
he
plucked
at
the
biwa
,
trying
to
make
the
sounds
he
wrought
resemble
an
ancient
Japanese
tune
he
had
once
heard
.

It
was
as
though
the
biwa
had
been
eaten
up
by
the
wind
.

I
was
thoroughly
startled
.

He
wasn't
the
least
bit
disturbed
by
my
watching
him
,
said
Charlotte
.

I've
heard
about
it
,
Samuel
Burns
said
.

And
the
man
who
brought
sweet
potatoes
into
Kanto
is
buried
there
,
next
to
a
beautiful
seated
statue
of
Fudo
.

It
would
kill
one
of
us
.

But
the
point
is
,
Charlotte
said
,
there
he
was
,
freezing
,
naked
in
a
little
stream
of
water
at
Ryusenji
,
all
in
worship
of
Fudo
,
the
god
of
fire
.

He
had
almost
given
up
when
he
realized
that
the
dropping
of
his
biwa
into
the
icy
jowls
of
the
black
Pacific
was
the
memory
for
which
he
had
been
searching
.

That
night
,
after
leaving
Charlotte's
apartment
,
Richard
walked
about
for
a
time
before
returning
to
his
room
.

He
was
surprised
by
the
sharp
sensation
he
experienced
as
he
approached
the
pool
which
Charlotte
had
mentioned
.

He
went
through
a
gate
to
stand
at
the
edge
of
the
water
and
gazed
at
the
two
thin
falls
which
dropped
from
large
spigots
high
at
the
back
of
the
pool
.

He
stayed
home
,
reading
and
refusing
to
think
about
his
frightening
experience
at
Ryusenji
.

But
the
process
of
refusing
to
think
about
it
was
an
active
reminder
in
itself
and
he
couldn't
rid
himself
of
a
consciousness
of
it
throughout
the
day
.

The
cold
lingered
,
making
sleep
difficult
that
night
,
and
he
remained
in
bed
still
the
next
morning
,
now
unable
to
keep
from
thinking
about
the
inexplicable
sight
of
burning
metal
,
the
wretched
sound
,
the
unbearable
feeling
of
having
been
to
a
remote
Tokyo
temple
at
some
earlier
time
in
his
life
.

The
snake
slid
slowly
and
with
great
care
from
the
new
ridge
the
plow
had
made
,
into
the
furrow
and
did
not
go
any
further
.

I
had
never
liked
snakes
much
,
I
still
had
that
kind
of
quick
panic
that
I'd
had
as
a
child
whenever
I
saw
one
,
but
this
snake
was
clean
and
bright
and
very
beautiful
.

I
pulled
the
throttle
of
the
tractor
in
and
out
,
hoping
to
frighten
him
with
the
noise
,
but
the
snake
only
flicked
its
black
,
forked
tongue
and
faced
the
huge
tractor
wheel
,
without
fright
or
concern
.

I
let
the
engine
idle
then
,
and
I
got
down
and
went
around
the
wheel
and
stood
beside
it
.

You
beauty
,
I
said
,
I
couldn't
kill
you
.

I
picked
him
up
,
and
the
length
of
him
arched
very
carefully
and
gracefully
and
only
a
little
wildly
,
and
I
could
feel
the
coolness
of
that
radiant
,
fire-colored
body
,
like
splendid
ice
,
and
I
knew
that
he
had
eaten
only
recently
because
there
were
two
whole
and
solid
little
lumps
in
the
forepart
of
him
,
like
fieldmice
swallowed
whole
might
make
.

The
snake
worked
away
very
slowly
and
delicately
and
with
a
gorgeous
kind
of
dignity
and
beauty
,
and
he
carried
his
head
a
little
above
the
rolled
clods
.

I
felt
good
and
satisfied
,
looking
at
the
snake
.

I
could
see
the
hunched-up
shoulders
,
the
savage
determination
,
the
dance
of
his
feet
as
he
ground
the
snake
with
his
heels
,
and
the
pirouette
of
his
arms
as
he
whipped
at
it
with
the
stick
.

I
drove
the
tractor
on
,
not
looking
down
there
;
;

I
was
afraid
to
look
for
fear
the
evil
might
still
be
going
on
.

I
knew
the
boy
well
.

Can
I
ride
around
with
you
?
?

You
saw
the
colors
of
it
,
didn't
you
?
?

They
eat
chickens
sometimes
,
the
boy
said
.

I
wrenched
the
stake
out
,
that
the
boy
had
driven
through
it
in
the
thickest
part
of
its
body
,
between
the
colored
diamond
crystals
.

I
took
the
broken
length
of
it
around
the
tractor
and
I
took
one
of
the
wrenches
from
the
tool-kit
and
I
struck
its
head
,
not
looking
at
it
,
to
kill
it
at
last
,
for
it
could
never
live
.

It's
a
big
snake
,
isn't
it
?
?

Don't
,
I
said
.

I
wanted
to
slap
his
face
,
to
wipe
forever
the
insolence
and
brutal
glee
from
his
mouth
,
and
I
decided
then
,
very
suddenly
,
what
I
would
do
.

Cady
didn't
come
unglued
easily
,
but
this
had
not
been
a
day
of
glad
tidings
.

Maybe
he
should
have
kept
in
touch
.

But
he
had
been
busy
building
a
business
,
being
a
big
man
in
his
own
town
just
as
he
had
been
a
big
man
at
Hanford
,
Class
of
1935
.

Good
solid
B
average
with
a
sprinkling
of
A's
in
math
and
science
.

Getting
elected
president
of
the
student
body
took
a
lot
of
time
and
politicking
.

He
put
down
his
pipe
and
started
to
type
.

David
had
the
same
gray
eyes
,
high
cheekbones
,
dark
hair
and
a
certain
rugged
ugliness
.

Mr.
Partlow
banged
his
fist
on
the
keyboard
,
ruining
the
letter
.

How
do
you
tell
a
college
like
Hanford
that
your
son
has
a
vast
potential
,
that
he
will
find
himself
?
?

Anne
had
a
way
with
words
.

He
could
take
the
advice
or
leave
it
.

You
look
like
you
just
heard
a
real
gasser
,
Mr.
Partlow
.

As
he
drove
home
through
the
thinning
traffic
,
Cady
felt
the
unease
growing
.

Work
to
do
.

Can
I
have
the
car
,
Dad
?
?

Cady
,
deep
in
thought
,
neither
heard
nor
answered
.

Dave
ate
two
pieces
of
pie
as
he
did
everything
else
,
slowly
,
methodically
and
with
interest
.

Hear
anything
from
Hanford
yet
,
Dad
?
?

Dave
shrugged
on
his
sports
coat
and
picked
up
the
car
keys
.

Anne
said
it
wasn't
surprising
because
Charles
was
antisocial
,
a
lone
wolf
,
and
completely
one-sided
.

He
looks
a
little
bit
frayed
.

Anne
waited
until
the
door
had
slammed
and
picked
up
the
coffeepot
.

Here's
what
I
wrote
.

I
know
you
wrote
this
in
a
hurry
,
but
,
Cady
,
Dave
was
only
acting
president
of
the
student
forum
for
a
few
days
.

No
,
Cady
,
he
made
second
team
.

Just
missed
the
first
.

Those
aren't
his
interests
now
.

Yes
,
he's
just
there
.

Did
you
know
he
is
advertising
his
ham-radio
equipment
for
sale
this
weekend
?
?

It's
Dave
who
is
applying
to
Hanford
College
.

Why
don't
you
ask
him
?
?

I
have
talked
to
him
,
but
you
know
I've
never
tried
to
push
him
into
any
profession
.

I
won't
be
guilty
of
trying
to
run
his
life
.

Just
because
your
father
tried
to
make
a
banker
out
of
you
,
you've
leaned
over
backward
to
keep
your
hands
off
.

But
subconsciously
you've
wanted
him
to
conform
to
your
mold
.

Dave
has
qualities
of
leadership
.

Give
him
time
.

He
had
always
been
a
messy
and
negligent
man
.

But
,
at
the
start
,
his
new
life
felt
invigorating
.

I
think
you'll
get
tired
of
them
there
.

She'll
rush
to
the
bedroom
when
the
doorbell
rings
.

A
glissade
of
giggles
slid
over
their
voices
.

At
last
there
was
a
void
no
one
could
fill
.

If
the
situation
had
been
bad
,
it
now
got
worse
.

About
this
time
people
began
dropping
in
,
considering
that
the
newly
married
had
been
left
alone
long
enough
.

They
entered
the
bedroom
,
and
Dolores
said
nothing
.

With
her
eyes
Dolores
dared
him
for
the
truth
,
ready
to
begin
:
It's
a
little
contest
--

What
to
talk
about
?
?

We
were
up
to
visit
them
and

Everyone
would
know
why
;
;

he
would
cut
a
supremely
ridiculous
figure
.

Nothing
would
change
,
nothing
would
ever
change
.

On
the
other
hand
,
if
she
didn't
remove
her
own
things
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
to
the
parade
of
guests
which
traversed
the
apartment
.

The
tale
,
he
thought
,
would
become
less
gay
.

He
saw
that
in
a
moment
she
had
grasped
all
the
implications
of
a
plot
which
had
been
weeks
in
occurring
to
him
.

Well
,
Martin
thought
,
That'll
save
.

Good
old
A-Z
,
Cap
said
.

Isn't
his
racket
down
your
alley
?
?

A
rush
of
memory
swept
him
back
,
and
he
forgot
Cap
.

Willis
listened
patiently
,
and
once
in
a
while
William
was
exposed
to
them
at
a
family
gathering
;
;

Another
factor
must
have
been
the
eventual
disposal
of
Willis'
fortune
;
;

Feeling
his
power
,
Freddy
looked
for
additional
worlds
to
conquer
.

I
know
a
guy
named
Jack
Hamrick
,
a
very
bright
young
engineer
who
was
with
Chrysler
,
and
I
took
him
with
me
to
Allstates
.

It's
his
expert
opinion
that
the
plant
isn't
well
suited
to
what
you
have
in
mind
.

Willis
glanced
at
the
bound
pages
given
him
and
shrugged
.

Freddy
is
deeply
committed
to
our
plans
already
.

He
assures
me
he
has
people
to
handle
the
money
raising
,
and
Ham
Richert
,
my
lawyer
,
says
the
legal
aspects
of
the
wedding
of
Zenith
and
Allstates
are
no
problem
.

Let
me
think
about
it
.

Not
to
William's
surprise
,
Freddy
,
Adam
and
Hamilton
Richert
prevailed
;
;

Once
more
Willis
summoned
William
.

I
wish
I
was
younger
and
less
timid
.

You
have
the
controlling
interest
and
the
principal
expenditure
is
yours
--
and
,
besides
,
nobody
else
is
going
to
have
the
courage
.

We
are
here
to
transact
business
.

Can't
we
put
an
end
to
this
,
Arthur
?
?

Nothing
has
been
lost
.

Sweat
started
out
on
William's
forehead
,
whether
from
relief
or
disquietude
he
could
not
tell
.

Hello
,
boss
,
he
said
,
and
grinned
.

Mills
secured
Barco's
photograph
from
the
gentleman
in
charge
,
rushed
to
the
Hollywood
police
station
to
report
the
theft
,
and
less
than
five
minutes
later
,
detectives
with
his
picture
in
hand
were
on
the
trail
of
Cal
Barco
.

On
their
way
,
they
stopped
at
every
gas
station
along
the
main
boulevards
to
question
the
attendants
.

They
headed
in
that
direction
and
,
at
San
Juan
Capistrano
By-the-Sea
came
upon
Barco
sitting
in
the
quaint
old
Spanish
Mission
Drive-in
,
eating
a
hot
tamale
.

At
the
moment
,
Barco's
back
was
to
the
road
so
he
didn't
see
the
detectives
close
in
on
his
convertible
which
,
in
their
quest
for
the
stolen
lap
rug
,
they
proceeded
to
search
.

However
while
in
his
cell
awaiting
trial
for
theft
,
Barco
,
in
a
fit
of
apprehension
,
made
an
attempt
to
take
his
own
life
.

The
jail
authorities
--
attaching
no
particular
significance
to
the
episode
--
offered
Barco
whisky
to
revive
him
;
;

It
was
reported
to
Welch's
office
that
a
thief
in
the
city
jail
had
attempted
suicide
.

The
suicide
attempt
looked
to
him
like
an
opportunity
to
put
his
theory
to
the
test
.

It
required
strength
,
bravado
,
daring
to
commit
murder
.

That
worm
a
murderer
?
?

Then
,
for
the
first
time
since
his
arrest
,
a
glint
of
spirit
lit
Barco's
eyes
.

His
manhood
had
been
attacked
.

I
can
lead
you
to
every
one
of
the
bodies
,
and
there
ain't
four
,
nor
five
,
nor
six
of
'em
--
there's
seven
!
!

Stopping
the
cars
at
a
fork
in
the
road
,
he
got
out
,
paced
off
a
certain
distance
to
a
spot
between
two
shrub-covered
sand
hills
,
and
indicated
a
location
.

Orders
were
given
to
dig
.

Joking
stopped
and
everyone
gathered
around
.

Although
it
was
a
mere
fragment
of
the
victim's
remains
,
it
was
enough
.

It
went
to
his
head
,
and
his
ambition
increased
.

It
was
apparent
that
Welch
was
in
cahoots
with
Marshall
and
would
use
his
power
as
D.A.
to
drag
every
possible
sensation
into
the
case
.

It
wasn't
long
before
I
sensed
that
there
was
something
deeper
than
overvaulting
ambition
back
of
his
desire
for
Viola's
destruction
.

A
dreadful
fear
entered
my
consciousness
that
perhaps
he
had
entertained
aspirations
toward
Viola's
favors
--
or
,
even
more
serious
perhaps
,
that
he
had
attained
a
share
of
them
and
had
then
been
superseded
by
some
luckier
chap
.

I
did
not
rest
until
I
had
tracked
the
mystery
down
.

Viola
had
been
urged
to
attend
,
by
telephone
,
and
not
knowing
the
host
or
the
character
of
the
party
,
she
had
gone
.

the
air
was
thick
with
smoke
,
empty
bottles
were
in
evidence
,
and
several
of
the
guests
were
somewhat
the
worse
for
liquor
.

And
here
it
was
!
!

But
Mother
insisted
,
for
it
is
seldom
indeed
that
anyone
remotely
connected
with
the
cinema
is
ever
received
in
their
exclusive
midsts
.

I
was
saved
from
making
the
decision
as
the
phone
rang
,
and
the
girls
were
upon
me
instantly
.

Under
the
circumstances
,
I
had
difficulty
keeping
up
with
the
conversation
on
the
phone
,
but
when
I
hung
up
I
was
reasonably
certain
that
Francesca
had
wanted
to
remind
me
of
our
town
meeting
the
next
evening
,
and
how
important
it
was
that
Hank
and
I
be
there
.

Resolving
to
get
something
done
,
I
started
in
on
the
dishes
.

I
am
not
saying
it
right
.

They
were
personalities
.

I
admired
their
easy
way
of
doing
things
but
I
couldn't
escape
an
uneasiness
at
their
way
of
always
doing
the
right
things
.

It
was
all
set
up
so
there
would
be
no
dust
anywhere
and
so
that
their
children
would
color
in
the
coloring
room
,
paint
in
the
painting
room
,
play
with
blocks
in
the
block
house
,
and
do
all
the
other
things
in
the
proper
rooms
at
exactly
the
right
time
.

Their
two
boys
were
well
adjusted
and
,
like
their
parents
,
always
did
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
and
damn
the
consequences
.

No
one
could
dislike
them
,
I
thought
.

I
wouldn't
have
wasted
time
puzzling
over
this
couple
were
it
not
for
my
fear
that
all
the
other
inhabitants
of
Catatonia
were
equally
unreal
.

After
five
minutes
with
Blanche
,
one
might
welcome
the
astringency
of
Grazie
,
who
was
a
sort
of
Gwen
Cafritz
to
Francesca's
Perle
Mesta
.

Grazie
was
mean
:
quietly
mean
,
and
bitterly
,
unfunnily
sarcastic
.

I
wouldn't
have
missed
it
for
anything
.

They
were
sincere
--
men
of
the
too-hearty
handclasp
and
the
urgent
smile
.

I
made
plans
for
the
afternoon
--
doing
the
breakfast
and
luncheon
dishes
all
at
once
,
making
the
beds
,
and
then
maybe
painting
the
kitchen
.

Bananas
!
!

Then
Jennie
closed
her
eyes
,
stretched
forth
her
arms
,
and
said
:
Take
my
hand
,
Louise
;
;

Needless
to
say
,
I
was
furious
at
this
unparalleled
intrusion
upon
free
enterprise
.

It
is
as
though
,
I
said
on
the
historic
three-hour
,
coast-to-coast
radio
broadcast
which
I
bought
(
following
Father
Coughlin
and
pre-empting
the
Eddie
Cantor
,
Manhattan
Merry-go-round
and
Major
Bowes
shows
)
That
Man
in
the
White
House
,
like
some
despot
of
yore
,
insisted
on
reading
my
diary
,
raiding
my
larder
and
ransacking
my
lingerie
!
!

Presidential
coercion
had
succeeded
not
only
in
poisoning
the
courtiers
,
toadies
and
sycophants
of
the
bench
against
me
,
but
it
had
been
so
far-reaching
as
to
discourage
any
lawyer
in
the
nation
from
representing
me
!
!

I
was
,
it
seemed
,
persona
non
grata
in
every
quarter
,
but
not
entirely
without
a
staunch
following
of
noted
political
thinkers
and
students
of
jurisprudence
.

Could
it
do
otherwise
?
?

Having
(
through
my
unflagging
effort
and
devotion
)
achieved
stardom
,
a
fortune
and
a
world-renowned
wife
at
an
age
when
most
young
men
are
casting
their
first
vote
,
Letch
proceeded
to
neglect
them
all
.

)
As
for
his
private
monies
,
they
were
rapidly
dissipated
in
drinking
,
gaming
and
carousing
.

Ah
,
you
are
too
old
,
was
invariably
his
ungallant
and
untrue
retort
whenever
I
suggested
starting
a
family
.

I
now
felt
it
wiser
to
keep
Baby-dear
in
school
and
--
during
the
summers
--
at
a
camp
run
by
the
Society
of
Friends
all
year
around
.

Our
last
joint
venture
,
Sainted
Lady
,
a
deeply
religious
film
based
on
the
life
of
Mother
Cabrini
,
and
timed
so
that
its
release
date
would
coincide
with
the
beatification
of
America's
first
saint
in
November
,
1938
,
was
a
fiasco
from
start
to
finish
.

By
the
time
the
film
was
released
we
were
three
million
dollars
over-spent
,
war
was
imminent
and
the
public
apparently
had
forgotten
all
about
Mother
Cabrini
.

At
the
same
time
,
however
,
I
availed
myself
of
the
services
of
that
great
English
actor
and
master
of
make-up
,
Sir
Gauntley
Pratt
,
to
do
a
quickie
called
The
Mystery
of
the
Mad
Marquess
,
in
which
I
played
a
young
American
girl
who
inherits
a
haunted
castle
on
the
English
moors
which
is
filled
with
secret
passages
and
sliding
panels
and
,
unbeknownst
to
anyone
,
is
still
occupied
by
an
eccentric
maniac
.

It
was
a
potboiler
made
on
a
shoestring
and
not
the
sort
of
film
I
like
,
as
all
I
had
to
do
was
look
blank
and
scream
a
great
deal
.

Once
he
disposed
of
these
items
which
screamed
so
harshly
for
attention
,
he
could
undertake
the
things
which
really
counted
.

Then
,
at
last
,
his
day
would
fall
into
an
ordered
pattern
and
he
would
be
free
to
read
,
or
garden
or
just
wander
through
the
woods
in
the
late
afternoon
,
accompanied
by
his
dogs
.

Was
it
possible
that
as
people
grow
older
the
nature
of
time
changed
?
?

Did
it
take
a
man
of
sixty-five
longer
to
write
a
letter
,
shave
,
clean
out
a
barn
,
read
a
newspaper
,
than
a
man
of
thirty
?
?

There
was
no
compulsion
behind
them
.

During
all
his
busy
life
he
had
only
done
things
which
had
to
be
done
.

He
turned
over
impatiently
and
pulled
the
sheet
over
his
head
against
the
treacherous
encroachment
of
the
dawn
.

He
went
down
to
Mills
and
Bradley's
Hardware
Store
and
bought
a
full
set
of
carpenter's
tools
,
including
a
rotary
power
saw
and
several
other
pieces
of
power
machinery
that
Mr.
Mills
said
were
essential
for
babbiting
and
doweling
,
whatever
they
were
.

Add
things
as
you
find
you
need
'em
.

When
he
returned
home
,
the
station
wagon
loaded
with
tools
,
Jinny
had
gone
with
a
friend
to
some
meeting
in
the
village
,
using
the
recently
purchased
second
car
.

He
had
made
such
a
fuss
about
buying
that
second
car
that
he
knew
he
was
vulnerable
.

The
old
nightmare
which
had
caused
him
so
many
wakeful
hours
came
charging
in
on
him
once
more
,
only
this
time
he
couldn't
pacify
it
with
a
sleeping
pill
and
send
it
away
.

But
then
,
when
you
stuck
things
into
the
holes
,
why
didn't
they
come
right
out
again
?
?

He
turned
his
attention
to
the
workbench
.

To
his
amazement
he
reached
him
.

Mr.
Crumb
was
laid
up
with
a
bad
cold
.

The
only
trouble
was
that
he
himself
was
tied
up
on
the
school
job
.

No
,
he
didn't
know
of
any
handyman-carpenter
.

Mr.
Crumb
would
probably
see
him
at
Lodge
Meeting
the
next
night
.

While
Mr.
Blatz
was
putting
up
the
pegboards
and
starting
the
workbench
,
Mr.
Crombie
told
him
of
this
idea
about
paneling
the
whole
end
of
the
cellar
.

Without
further
discussion
he
appeared
the
next
morning
with
a
pile
of
boards
sticking
over
the
end
of
his
light
truck
and
proceeded
with
the
paneling
,
which
he
then
stained
and
waxed
according
to
his
taste
.

then
a
couple
of
fluorescent
lamps
over
the
workbench
an'
I
guess
we
are
about
through
down
here
.

I
guess
you
know
about
that
.

He
oughta
be
able
to
build
a
new
house
with
all
them
contraptions
.

Mr.
Crombie
watched
his
wife
with
an
anxious
expression
.

Mr.
Crombie
couldn't
remember
his
saying
any
such
thing
.

But
those
are
the
things
I
built
the
workshop
for
,
protested
Mr.
Crombie
.

I've
been
waiting
to
get
these
things
done
for
months
,
she
said
.

You
explain
English
by
Greek
.

There
are
many
types
of
ambiguity
and
many
of
them
have
been
described
by
rhetoricians
under
such
names
as
amphibology
,
parisology
,
and
other
ologies
.

Another
case
involves
a
newspaper
reporter
who
tripped
up
a
politician
.

Mr.
Jones
,
you
may
recall
that
we
printed
last
week
your
denial
of
having
retracted
the
contradiction
of
your
original
statement
.

Questions
like
this
,
framed
in
verbal
fog
,
are
perhaps
the
only
kind
that
have
ever
stumped
an
experienced
politician
.

Similarly
,
when
a
reporter
once
questioned
Lincoln
in
cryptic
fashion
,
Lincoln
refused
to
make
any
further
statement
.

I
fear
explanations
explanatory
of
things
explained
,
he
said
,
leaving
the
biter
bit
--
and
bitter
.

Good
!
!

I
see
the
girl
but
I
don't
see
the
car
with
slacks
on
.

In
one
cartoon
a
family
is
shown
outside
a
theater
with
the
head
of
the
family
addressing
the
doorman
:
Excuse
me
,
but
when
we
came
out
we
found
that
we
had
left
my
daughter's
handbag
and
my
wife's
behind
.

Classified
ads
are
also
chockfull
of
misrelated
constructions
.

Officials

The
newspaper
too
is
the
favorite
habitat
of
the
anatomical
.

In
news
items
a
man
is
less
often
shot
in
the
body
or
head
than
in
the
suburbs
.

But
since
the
gourmet
insisted
that
it
is
done
that
way
at
the
most
fashionable
dinners
,
the
girl
reluctantly
agreed
.

This
saleslady
was
a
failure
in
the
dress
department
and
was
transferred
to
the
shoe
department
.

An
old-fashioned
mother
said
to
her
modern
daughter
,
You
must
have
gotten
in
quite
late
last
night
,
dear
.

A
blue
suit
,
he
answered
.

That's
one
thing
I've
never
done
,
she
said
promptly
.

In
the
comedy
of
indefinite
reference
,
it-wit
occupies
a
prominent
place
because
of
its
frequent
occurrence
.

It-wit
is
a
misnomer
because
it
covers
slips
as
well
as
wit
.

After
Gagarin
became
the
Greatest
Man
in
the
World
,
for
a
nation
that
does
not
believe
in
the
cult
of
personality
or
in
careerism
,
Moreland
wrote
me
a
letter
in
which
he
said
:
I
am
not
interested
in
how
long
a
bee
can
live
in
a
vacuum
,
or
how
far
it
can
fly
.

The
Zeitgeist
is
not
crazy
as
a
loon
or
mad
as
a
March
hare
;
;

Just
barely
,
he
said
,
and
repeated
his
paraphrase
:
The
time
has
come
,
the
walrus
said
,
To
speak
of
manic
things
,
Of
shots
and
shouts
,
and
sealing
dooms
Of
commoners
and
kings
.

I
took
a
deep
breath
and
an
even
deeper
swallow
of
my
drink
,
and
said
,
I
admit
that
going
back
to
Ralph
Waldo
Emerson
for
humor
is
like
going
to
a
modern
musical
comedy
for
music
and
comedy
.

Speaking
of
nonism
:
the
other
day
,
in
a
story
about
a
sit-down
demonstration
,
the
Paris
Herald
Tribune
wrote
,
'
The
non-violence
became
noisier
.

If
we
cannot
tell
evil
,
horror
,
and
insanity
from
nonsense
,
what
is
the
future
of
humor
and
comedy
?
?

The
heart
,
I
said
finally
,
is
now
either
in
the
throat
or
the
mouth
or
the
stomach
or
the
shoes
.

You
have
visited
England
five
times
in
the
past
quarter-century
,
I
believe
,
my
host
said
.

It
now
means
ominous
,
as
when
one
speaks
of
a
funny
sound
in
the
motor
;
;

The
sound
mockery
of
sheep
is
like
the
salubrious
horse
laugh
.

That
is
only
partly
non-nonsense
,
he
began
.

If
you
saw
the
drama
called
Rhinoceros
,
I
said
,
think
of
the
effect
it
would
have
on
an
audience
of
rhinos
when
the
actor
on
stage
suddenly
begins
turning
into
a
rhinoceros
.

--
if
that
can
be
screamed
in
their
language
.

It
consists
in
saying
,
'
That
would
be
sending
the
goat
to
look
after
the
cabbage
.

In
our
age
of
Science
and
Angst
it
seems
to
me
more
brave
to
stay
on
Earth
and
explore
inner
man
than
to
fly
far
from
the
sphere
of
our
sorrow
and
explore
outer
space
.

The
other
day
Arnold
Toynbee
spoke
against
the
inveterate
tendency
of
our
species
to
believe
in
the
uniqueness
of
its
religions
,
its
ideologies
,
and
its
virtually
everything
else
.

I
wrote
a
few
years
ago
that
one
of
the
cardinal
rules
of
writing
is
that
the
reader
should
be
able
to
get
some
idea
of
what
the
story
is
about
.

One
day
,
the
children
had
wanted
to
get
up
onto
General
Burnside's
horse
.

Arlene
was
boosting
them
up
when
the
policeman
came
by
.

The
policeman's
eyes
rather
popped
for
a
second
;
;

but
then
Arlene
got
another
tone
in
a
hurry
,
and
she
said
,
If
it
wasn't
for
these
dear
children
--
.

The
policeman
got
a
confused
,
funny
look
on
his
face
,
and
he
had
answered
kind
of
politely
,
Now
,
look
here
,
lady
:
I
know
you
got
to
entertain
these
kids
and
all
.

and
so
they
were
consistently
true
to
their
principles
.

I
know
something
that
is
much
more
fun
that
we
can
do
on
our
little
lawn
.

Maybe
that
was
why
they
were
cordial
and
loyal
towards
the
unpredictability
of
Arlene
.

First
,
Arlene
had
put
them
through
some
rapid
somersaults
.

She
would
sometimes
even
get
a
little
hard
on
you
,
she
took
you
so
seriously
.

Then
,
Arlene
threw
herself
backwards
and
wiggled
in
a
way
that
was
just
wonderful
.

She
held
herself
that
way
and
turned
her
head
towards
them
and
laughed
and
winked
.

It
all
has
something
to
do
with
General
Burnside
and
his
horse
.

His
legs
shook
,
and
the
shaking
went
right
on
up
his
body
through
his
hips
to
his
shoulders
.

It
wasn't
very
funny
.

But
that
wasn't
very
funny
,
either
.

And
Arlene
showed
them
how
to
begin
.

I
suppose
you
all
were
playing
and
forgot
?
?

But
do
you
know
something
curious
?
?

I
opened
the
window
and
threw
the
radish
out
.

nobody
could
have
told
why
.

A
friend
of
my
father's
came
to
dinner
.

As
a
matter
of
fact
,
this
happened
every
four
or
five
months
.

Sometimes
,
as
at
this
juncture
,
he
did
not
.

But
he
was
always
persuaded
out
.

the
two
youngest
in
our
family
always
had
to
be
brought
in
and
put
through
tricks
for
his
entertainment
.

They
were
pushed
gently
into
the
room
by
Arlene
--
whose
only
part
appearing
were
hands
that
crept
quickly
back
around
to
the
kitchen
side
of
the
door
.

But
,
at
the
beginning
,
this
stayed
just
in
the
air
.

We
don't
.

the
hostess
in
her
took
over
.

He
would
not
look
up
.

He
was
very
funny
about
the
whole
thing
.

Marcellus
,
the
hero
,
is
beset
from
all
sides
by
the
problems
of
approaching
manhood
.

An
unusual
,
if
not
extraordinary
,
rendering
of
the
classic
myth
that
involves
the
rescue
of
Prometheus
from
the
rock
by
the
U.S.
Cavalry
was
given
last
week
in
the
warehouse
of
the
Albany
Leather
Conduit
Company
amid
cheers
of
Hubba
hubba
and
Yalagaloo
pip
pip
!
!

After
a
busy
overture
,
the
curtain
rises
on
a
farm
scene
--
the
Ranavan
Valley
in
northern
Maine
.

As
we
find
out
at
the
end
,
it
is
not
the
stool
(
symbolizing
Doris
,
therefore
the
English
)
that
he
is
punishing
but
the
piece
of
Venetian
blind
.

and
it
is
not
unlikely
that
,
even
as
the
great
Bach
lay
dormant
for
so
many
years
,
so
has
the
erudite
,
ingenious
SalFininistas
passed
through
his
purgatory
of
neglect
.

As
he
leads
the
Neurenschatz
Skolkau
Orchestra
,
Schlek
gives
a
tremendously
inspired
performance
of
both
the
Baslot
and
Rattzhenfuut
concertos
,
including
the
controversial
Tschilwyk
cadenza
,
which
was
included
at
the
conductor's
insistence
.

For
the
last
two
years
,
this
frontier
of
the
arts
has
produced
a
number
of
so-called
non-dramas
which
have
left
indelible
,
bittersweet
impressions
on
the
psyche
of
this
veteran
theatregoer
.

Although
the
play
does
show
a
certain
structural
amateurishness
(
there
are
eleven
acts
varying
in
length
from
twenty-five
seconds
to
an
hour
and
a
half
)
,
the
statement
it
makes
concerning
the
ceaseless
yearning
and
searching
of
youth
is
profound
and
worthy
of
our
attention
.

They
are
relentlessly
rebuffed
on
all
sides
by
a
waitress
,
the
police
,
and
an
intruding
government
tutor
.

The
innocence
that
they
tried
to
conceal
at
the
beginning
is
clearly
destroyed
forever
when
one
of
them
,
asking
for
a
piece
of
lemon-meringue
pie
,
gets
a
plate
of
English
muffins
instead
.

Petite
,
lovely
Yvette
Chadroe
plays
the
nymphomaniac
engagingly
.

It
is
not
an
entirely
happy
book
,
as
Mrs.
Fink
soon
becomes
jealous
of
Alicia
and
,
in
retaliation
,
refuses
to
continue
to
scrape
the
algae
off
her
glass
.

This
brief
resume
hardly
does
the
book
justice
,
but
I
heartily
recommend
it
to
all
those
who
are
engages
with
the
major
problems
of
our
time
.

Dear
Sirs
:
Let
me
begin
by
clearing
up
any
possible
misconception
in
your
minds
,
wherever
you
are
.

The
collective
by
which
I
address
you
in
the
title
above
is
neither
patronizing
nor
jocose
but
an
exact
industrial
term
in
use
among
professional
thieves
.

Since
the
latter
obviously
require
an
audacity
you
do
not
possess
,
you
may
perhaps
suppose
that
I
am
taunting
you
as
socially
inferior
.

Far
from
it
;
;

As
you've
doubtless
forgotten
the
circumstances
in
the
press
of
more
recent
depredations
,
permit
me
to
recapitulate
them
briefly
.

Well
,
ordinarily
he
is
,
except
(
as
the
Wheel
of
the
Law
specifies
)
toward
impious
folk
who
steal
,
disturb
,
or
maltreat
the
Presence
.

The
cycle
of
disaster
starts
the
moment
they
touch
any
belonging
of
ours
,
and
dogs
them
unto
the
forty-fifth
generation
.

Sort
of
remorseless
,
isn't
it
?
?

Now
,
you
no
doubt
regard
the
preceding
as
pap
;
;

you
are
tooling
around
full
of
gage
in
your
hot
rods
,
gorging
yourselves
on
pizza
and
playing
pinball
in
the
taverns
and
generally
behaving
like
Ubermenschen
.

Well
,
the
odious
little
toad
went
along
chivying
animals
and
humans
who
couldn't
retaliate
,
and
in
due
course
,
as
was
inevitable
,
overreached
himself
.

He's
really
asking
for
it
.

he
had
aged
thirty
years
,
and
his
face
,
the
color
of
tallow
,
was
crisscrossed
with
wrinkles
,
as
though
it
had
been
wrapped
in
chicken
wire
.

The
grocery
the
youth
worked
for
soon
tired
of
his
depressing
effect
on
customers
,
most
of
whom
were
sufficiently
neurotic
without
the
threat
of
incubi
,
and
let
him
go
.

Reduced
to
beggary
,
he
at
last
got
a
job
as
office
boy
to
a
television
producer
.

His
hubris
,
deficiency
of
taste
,
and
sadism
carried
him
straightaway
to
the
top
.

Not
long
ago
,
I
rode
down
with
him
in
an
elevator
in
Radio
City
;
;

See
that
guy
?
?

The
operator
asked
pityingly
.

I
wouldn't
be
in
his
shoes
for
all
the
rice
in
China
.

There's
some
kind
of
a
nemesis
haunting
his
footsteps
.

However
one
looks
at
it
,
therefore
,
I'd
say
that
your
horoscope
for
this
autumn
is
the
reverse
of
rosy
.

you
can't
very
well
sidle
up
to
people
on
the
street
and
ask
if
they
want
to
buy
a
hot
Bodhisattva
.

As
you
can
count
on
me
to
do
the
same
.
