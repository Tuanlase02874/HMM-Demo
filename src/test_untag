The
jury
further
said
in
term-end
presentments
that
the
City
Executive
Committee
,
which
had
over-all
charge
of
the
election
,
``
deserves
the
praise
and
thanks
of
the
City
of
Atlanta
''
for
the
manner
in
which
the
election
was
conducted
.

Merger
proposed

However
,
the
jury
said
it
believes
``
these
two
offices
should
be
combined
to
achieve
greater
efficiency
and
reduce
the
cost
of
administration
''
.

The
City
Purchasing
Department
,
the
jury
said
,
``
is
lacking
in
experienced
clerical
personnel
as
a
result
of
city
personnel
policies
''
.

``
Failure
to
do
this
will
continue
to
place
a
disproportionate
burden
''
on
Fulton
taxpayers
.

Four
additional
deputies
be
employed
at
the
Fulton
County
Jail
and
``
a
doctor
,
medical
intern
or
extern
be
employed
for
night
and
weekend
duty
at
the
jail
''
.

Fulton
legislators
``

with
city
officials
to
pass
enabling
legislation
that

the

State
Party
Chairman
James
W.
Dorsey
added
that
enthusiasm
was
picking
up
for
a
state
rally
to
be
held
Sept.
8
in
Savannah
at
which
newly
elected
Texas
Sen.
John
Tower
will
be
the
featured
speaker
.

In
the
Blue
Ridge
meeting
,
the
audience
was
warned
that
entering
a
candidate
for
governor
would
force
it
to
take
petitions
out
into
voting
precincts
to
obtain
the
signatures
of
registered
voters
.

Despite
the
warning
,
there
was
a
unanimous
vote
to
enter
a
candidate
,
according
to
Republicans
who
attended
.

When
the
crowd
was
asked
whether
it
wanted
to
wait
one
more
term
to
make
the
race
,
it
voted
no
--
and
there
were
no
dissents
.

The
largest
hurdle
the
Republicans
would
have
to
face
is
a
state
law
which
says
that
before
making
a
first
race
,
one
of
two
alternative
courses
must
be
taken
:
1

Sam
Caldwell
,
State
Highway
Department
public
relations
director
,
resigned
Tuesday
to
work
for
Lt.
Gov.
Garland
Byrd's
campaign
.

Vandiver
likely
will
mention
the
$100
million
highway
bond
issue
approved
earlier
in
the
session
as
his
first
priority
item
.

The
department
apparently
intends
to
make
the
Rural
Roads
Authority
a
revolving
fund
under
which
new
bonds
would
be
issued
every
time
a
portion
of
the
old
ones
are
paid
off
by
tax
authorities
.

The
Highway
Department
source
told
The
Constitution
,
however
,
that
Vandiver
has
not
been
consulted
yet
about
the
plans
to
issue
the
new
rural
roads
bonds
.

A
similar
resolution
passed
in
the
Senate
by
a
vote
of
29-5
.

Colquitt

--
After
a
long
,
hot
controversy
,
Miller
County
has
a
new
school
superintendent
,
elected
,
as
a
policeman
put
it
,
in
the
``
coolest
election
I
ever
saw
in
this
county
''
.

I
didn't
smell
a
drop
of
liquor
,
and
we
didn't
have
a
bit
of
trouble
''
.

The
campaign
leading
to
the
election
was
not
so
quiet
,
however
.

He
told
the
committee
the
measure
would
merely
provide
means
of
enforcing
the
escheat
law
which
has
been
on
the
books
``
since
Texas
was
a
republic
''
.

His
contention
was
denied
by
several
bankers
,
including
Scott
Hudson
of
Sherman
,
Gaynor
B.
Jones
of
Houston
,
J.
B.
Brady
of
Harlingen
and
Howard
Cox
of
Austin
.

Cox
argued
that
the
bill
is
``
probably
unconstitutional
''
since
,
he
said
,
it
would
impair
contracts
.

He
also
complained
that
not
enough
notice
was
given
on
the
hearing
,
since
the
bill
was
introduced
only
last
Monday
.

--
Senators
unanimously
approved
Thursday
the
bill
of
Sen.
George
Parkhouse
of
Dallas
authorizing
establishment
of
day
schools
for
the
deaf
in
Dallas
and
the
four
other
largest
counties
.

There
was
no
debate
as
the
Senate
passed
the
bill
on
to
the
House
.

A
House
committee
which
heard
his
local
option
proposal
is
expected
to
give
it
a
favorable
report
,
although
the
resolution
faces
hard
sledding
later
.

Money
for
its
construction
will
be
sought
later
on
but
in
the
meantime
the
State
Hospital
board
can
accept
gifts
and
donations
of
a
site
.

Instead
,
retailers
would
sign
a
certificate
of
correctness
,
violation
of
which
would
carry
a
penalty
of
one
to
five
years
in
prison
,
plus
a
$1,000
fine
.

Under
Formby's
plan
,
an
appointee
would
be
selected
by
a
board
composed
of
the
governor
,
lieutenant
governor
,
speaker
of
the
House
,
attorney
general
and
chief
justice
of
the
Texas
Supreme
Court

Paradise

Thursday
.

Statements
by
other
legislators
that
Dallas
is
paying
for
all
its
water
program
by
local
bonds
,
and
that
less
populous
places
would
benefit
most
by
the
pending
bill
,
did
not
sway
Cotten's
attack
.

``
A
person
with
a
master's
degree
in
physics
,
chemistry
,
math
or
English
,
yet
who
has
not
taken
Education
courses
,
is
not
permitted
to
teach
in
the
public
schools
''
,
said
Grover
.

College
teachers
in
Texas
are
not
required
to
have
the
Education
courses
.

Fifty-three
of
the
150
representatives
immediately
joined
Grover
as
co-signers
of
the
proposal
.

He
also
received
a
Master
of
Science
degree
from
Texas
A
&
I
College
and
a
Bachelor
of
Science
degree
from
Southwestern
State
College

has
studied

``
We
must
solve
the
problems
which
have
forced
these
people
to
depend
upon
ADC
for
subsistence
''
,
Martin
said
.

The
volume
of
ADC
cases
will
decrease
,
Martin
reported
,
when
the
community
is
able
to
deal
effectively
with
two
problems
:
Relatively
limited
skills
and
discrimination
in
employment
because
of
color
.

Extension
of
the
ADC
program
to
all
children
in
need
living
with
any
relatives
,
including
both
parents
,
as
a
means
of
preserving
family
unity
.

The
disclosure
by
Charles
Bellows
,
chief
defense
counsel
,
startled
observers
and
was
viewed
as
the
prelude
to
a
quarrel
between
the
six
attorneys
representing
the
eight
former
policemen
now
on
trial
.

Fears
prejudicial
aspects

The
President
spent
much
of
the
week-end
at
his
summer
home
on
Cape
Cod
writing
the
first
drafts
of
portions
of
the
address
with
the
help
of
White
House
aids
in
Washington
with
whom
he
talked
by
telephone
.

Asked
to
elaborate
,
Pierre
Salinger
,
White
House
press
secretary
,
replied
,
``
I
would
say
it's
got
to
go
thru
several
more
drafts
''
.

The
last
10
cases
in
the
investigation
of
the
Nov.
8
election
were
dismissed
yesterday
by
Acting
Judge
John
M.
Karns
,
who
charged
that
the
prosecution
obtained
evidence
``
by
unfair
and
fundamentally
illegal
means
''
.

Karns
said
it
was
a
``
wrongful
act
''
for
Wexler
to
take
statements
``
privately
and
outside
of
the
grand
jury
room
''
.

He
said
this
constituted
a
``
very
serious
misuse
''
of
the
Criminal
court
processes
.

The
case
of
the
judges
in
the
58th
precinct
of
the
23d
ward
had
been
heard
previously
and
taken
under
advisement
by
Karns
.

Washington
,
Feb.
9

Similar
payroll
tax
boosts
would
be
imposed
on
those
under
the
railroad
retirement
system
.

Officials
estimated
the
annual
tax
boost
for
the
medical
plan
would
amount
to
1.5
billion
dollars
and
that
medical
benefits
paid
out
would
run
1
billion
or
more
in
the
first
year
,
1963
.

Both
figures
would
go
higher
in
later
years
.

The
aged
care
plan
carries
these
benefits
for
persons
over
65
who
are
under
the
social
security
and
railroad
retirement
systems
:
1

Full
payment
of
hospital
bills
for
stays
up
to
90
days
for
each
illness
,
except
that
the
patient
would
pay
$10
a
day
of
the
cost
for
the
first
nine
days
.

2

Full
payment
of
nursing
home
bills
for
up
to
180
days
following
discharge
from
a
hospital
.

The
President
noted
that
Congress
last
year
passed
a
law
providing
grants
to
states
to
help
pay
medical
bills
of
the
needy
aged
.

It
is
a
program
of
prepayment
of
health
costs
with
absolute
freedom
of
choice
guaranteed
.

Moreover
,
he
said
,
many
qualified
young
people
are
not
going
into
medicine
and
dentistry
because
they
can't
afford
the
schooling
costs
.

Contributions
to
schools

In
addition
,
the
government
would
pay
a
$1,000
``
cost
of
education
''
grant
to
the
schools
for
each
$1,500
in
scholarship
grants
.

He
further
proposed
grants
of
an
unspecified
sum
for
experimental
hospitals
.

Asks
research
funds

The
President
said
he
will
ask
Congress
to
increase
grants
to
states
for
vocational
rehabilitation
.

A
number
of
scattered
``
ayes
''
and
``
noes
''
was
heard
.

Explosion
avoided

In
the
case
of
Portugal
,
which
a
few
weeks
ago
was
rumored
ready
to
walk
out
of
the
NATO
Council
should
critics
of
its
Angola
policy
prove
harsh
,
there
has
been
a
noticeable
relaxation
of
tension
.

There
should
even
be
no
more
bitter
surprises
in
the
UN
General
Assembly
as
to
NATO
members'
votes
,
since
a
new
ad
hoc
NATO
committee
has
been
set
up
so
that
in
the
future
such
topics
as
Angola
will
be
discussed
in
advance
.

Exploratory
mood

A
certain
vagueness
may
also
be
caused
by
tactical
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
the
present
council
meeting
is
a
semipublic
affair
,
with
no
fewer
than
six
Soviet
correspondents
accredited
.

The
Secretary
of
State
has
also
solemnly
repeated
a
warning
to
the
Soviet
Union
that
the
United
States
will
not
stand
for
another
setback
in
Berlin
,
an
affirmation
once
again
taken
up
by
the
council
as
a
whole
.

Conflict
surveyed

The
Kennedy
administration
moves
haltingly
toward
a
Geneva
conference
on
Laos
just
as
serious
debate
over
its
foreign
policy
erupts
for
the
first
time
.

But
it
is
apparent
that
no
acceptable
formula
has
been
found
to
prevent
such
a
possibility
.

This
is
another
of
the
modifications
of
policy
on
Laos
that
the
Kennedy
administration
has
felt
compelled
to
make
.

One
Republican
senator
told
this
correspondent
that
he
was
constantly
being
asked
why
he
didn't
attack
the
Kennedy
administration
on
this
score
.

But
he
further
said
that
it
was
better
politics
to
let
others
question
the
wisdom
of
administration
policies
first
.

Detente
urged

Mr.
Nixon
,
for
his
part
,
would
oppose
intervention
in
Cuba
without
specific
provocation
.

But
he
did
recommend
that
President
Kennedy
state
clearly
that
if
Communist
countries
shipped
any
further
arms
to
Cuba
that
it
would
not
be
tolerated
.

Very
early
in
his
administration
he
informed
the
Kremlin
through
diplomatic
channels
,
a
high
official
source
disclosed
,
that
the
new
administration
would
react
even
tougher
than
the
Eisenhower
administration
would
during
the
formative
period
of
the
administration
.

But
thus
far
there
has
been
no
response
in
kind
.

Foreign
aid
programs
were
revamped
to
give
greater
emphasis
to
economic
aid
and
to
encourage
political
reform
in
recipient
nations
.

But
the
Communists
never
gave
sufficient
provocation
at
any
one
time
for
the
United
States
to
want
to
risk
a
limited
or
an
all-out
war
over
Laos
.

)

The
pro-Western
government
,
which
the
United
States
had
helped
in
a
revolt
against
the
Souvanna
Phouma
``
neutralist
''
government
,
never
did
appear
to
spark
much
fighting
spirit
in
the
Royal
Lao
Army
.

In
an
important
assertion
of
national
leadership
in
this
field
,
he
has
issued
an
executive
order
establishing
the
President's
committee
on
Juvenile
Delinquency
and
Crime
,
to
be
supported
and
assisted
by
a
Citizens
Advisory
Council
of
recognized
authorities
on
juvenile
problems
.

The
President
asks
the
support
and
cooperation
of
Congress
in
his
efforts
through
the
enactment
of
legislation
to
provide
federal
grants
to
states
for
specified
efforts
in
combating
this
disturbing
crime
trend
.

East
Providence
should
organize
its
civil
defense
setup
and
begin
by
appointing
a
full-time
director
,
Raymond
H.
Hawksley
,
the
present
city
CD
head
,
believes
.

One
advantage
that
would
come
to
the
city
in
having
a
full-time
director
,
he
said
,
is
that
East
Providence
would
become
eligible
to
apply
to
the
federal
government
for
financial
aid
in
purchasing
equipment
needed
for
a
sound
civil
defense
program
.

Matching
funds
also
can
be
obtained
for
procurement
of
such
items
as
radios
,
sirens
and
rescue
trucks
,
he
said
.

Speaking
of
the
present
status
of
civil
defense
in
the
city
,
Mr.
Hawksley
said
he
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
not
more
than
one
person
in
a
hundred
would
know
what
to
do
or
where
to
go
in
the
event
of
an
enemy
attack
.

If
the
city
council
fails
to
consider
appointment
of
a
full-time
CD
director
,
Mr.
Hawksley
said
,
then
he
plans
to
call
a
meeting
early
in
September
so
that
a
civil
defense
organization
will
be
developed
locally
.

One
of
the
first
things
he
would
do
,
he
said
,
would
be
to
organize
classes
in
first
aid
.

Mr.
Notte
was
responding
to
a
resolution
adopted
by
the
Central
Falls
City
Council
on
July
10
and
sent
to
the
state
house
by
Miss
Grant
.

The
governor
wrote
Miss
Grant
that
he
has
been
concerned
for
some
time
``
with
the
continuous
problem
which
confronts
our
local
and
state
law
enforcement
officers
as
a
result
of
the
laws
regulating
Sunday
sales
''
.

The
small
shops
``
must
be
retained
,
for
they
provide
essential
service
to
the
community
''
,
according
to
the
resolution
,
which
added
that
they
``
also
are
the
source
of
livelihood
for
thousands
of
our
neighbors
''
.

It
declares
that
Sunday
sales
licenses
provide
``
great
revenue
''
to
the
local
government
.

The
council
advised
the
governor
that
``
large
supermarkets
,
factory
outlets
and
department
stores
not
be
allowed
to
do
business
''
on
Sunday
.

Liberals
and
conservatives
in
both
parties
--
Democratic
and
Republican
--
should
divorce
themselves
and
form
two
independent
parties
,
George
H.
Reama
,
nationally
known
labor-management
expert
,
said
here
yesterday
.

That
,
he
added
,
was
when
he
was
``
a
very
young
man
,
a
machinist
and
toolmaker
by
trade
.

Some
of
my
fellow
workers
were
grooming
me
for
an
office
in
the
Socialist
Party
.

He
steered
me
to
the
right
track
--
the
free
enterprise
track
''
.

He
said
that
when
he
was
a
Socialist
in
1910
,
the
party
called
for
government
operation
of
all
utilities
and
the
pooling
of
all
resources
.

Mr.
Reama
,
far
from
really
being
retired
,
is
engaged
in
industrial
relations
counseling
.

The
law
which
governs
home
rule
charter
petitions
states
that
they
must
be
referred
to
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
canvassers
for
verification
of
the
signatures
within
10
days
and
Mr.
Martinelli
happens
to
hold
that
post
.

``
After
inspiring
this
,
I
think
we
should
certainly
follow
through
on
it
''
,
he
declared
.

He
said
he
would
not
be
surprised
if
some
of
the
more
than
30
members
of
the
group
are
interested
in
running
on
the
required
non-partisan
ballot
for
posts
on
the
charter
commission
.

pay
fines
at
the
local
police
station
may
be
taken
at
Monday's
special
North
Providence
Town
Council
meeting
.

Council
president
Frank
SanAntonio
said
yesterday
he
may
ask
the
council
to
formally
request
Town
Solicitor
Michael
A.
Abatuno
to
draft
the
ordinance
.

Nothing
has
been
done
yet
to
take
advantage
of
the
enabling
legislation
.

Hughes
said
Monday
,
``
It
is
the
apparent
intention
of
the
Republican
Party
to
campaign
on
the
carcass
of
what
they
call
Eisenhower
Republicanism
,
but
the
heart
stopped
beating
and
the
lifeblood
congealed
after
Eisenhower
retired
.

``
How
can
a
man
with
any
degree
of
common
decency
charge
this
''
?
?

Mitchell
said
the
closeness
of
the
outcome
in
last
fall's
Presidential
election
did
not
mean
that
Eisenhower
Republicanism
was
a
dead
issue
.

The
audience
last
night
did
not
respond
with
either
applause
or
boos
to
mention
of
Hughes'
remark
.

``
He
calls
for
help
while
saying
he
is
against
centralization
,
but
you
can't
have
it
both
ways
''
,
Jones
said
.

Defends
Ike

Sandman
said
:
``
The
announcement
that
Sen.
Clifford
Case
Aj
,
has
decided
to
spend
all
his
available
time
campaigning
for
Mr.
Mitchell
is
a
dead
giveaway
.

It
is
a
desperate
effort
to
prop
up
a
sagging
candidate
who
has
proven
he
cannot
answer
any
questions
about
New
Jersey's
problems
.

That
failed
.

In
October
1944
,
he
was
appointed
state
warden
and
chief
of
the
Forest
Fire
Section
.

He
promised
nearly
200
Democratic
county
committee
members
at
the
meeting
in
the
Puddingstone
Inn
:
``
When
I
come
back
here
after
the
November
election
you'll
think
,
'
You're
my
man
--
you're
the
kind
of
governor
we're
glad
we
elected
'
''
.

He
said
,
``
We
Democrats
must
resolve
our
issues
on
the
test
of
what
is
right
and
just
,
and
not
what
is
expedient
at
the
time
''
.

In
his
only
attack
on
the
Republicans
,
Hughes
said
,
``
The
three
Republican
candidates
for
governor
are
tripping
over
their
feet
for
popular
slogans
to
win
the
primary
.

``
We'll
take
the
truth
to
the
people
,
and
the
people
will
like
the
truth
and
elect
their
candidate
and
party
in
November
''
.

He
said
,
``
You
can
see
signs
of
the
Republicans'
feeble
attack
on
the
Meyner
administration
.

He
called
for
a
greater
attraction
of
industry
and
a
stop
to
the
piracy
of
industry
by
Southern
states
,
and
a
strong
fight
against
discrimination
in
business
and
industry
.

``
We
must
keep
the
bloodstream
of
New
Jersey
clean
''
,
the
former
Superior
Court
judge
said
.

The
other
$15
million
is
to
be
alloted
to
municipalities
on
a
matching
fund
basis
.

Hughes
said
,
``
This
is
not
a
plan
to
conquer
space
--
but
to
conserve
it
''
,
pointing
out
the
state
population
has
increased
125,000
each
year
since
1950

She
served
one
four-year
term
on
the
national
committee
.

Some
anti-organization
Democrats
saw
in
the
program
an
opportunity
to
end
the
bitter
internal
fight
within
the
Democratic
party
that
has
been
going
on
for
the
last
three
years
.

The
resentment
among
Democratic
organization
leaders
to
the
reported
Wagner
plan
was
directed
particularly
at
the
Mayor's
efforts
to
name
his
own
running
mates
without
consulting
the
leaders
.

In
an
apparent
effort
to
head
off
such
a
rival
primary
slate
,
Mr.
Wagner
talked
by
telephone
yesterday
with
Representative
Charles
A.
Buckley
,
the
Bronx
Democratic
leader
,
and
with
Joseph
T.
Sharkey
,
the
Brooklyn
Democratic
leader
.

The
Mayor
spoke
yesterday
at
the
United
Irish
Counties
Feis
on
the
Hunter
College
Campus
in
the
Bronx
.

The
Mayor
said
:

--
A
wave
of
public
resentment
against
corruption
in
government
is
rising
in
Massachusetts
.

``
The
hand
is
out
''
.

Leadership
is
hopeful

It
also
provides
for
funds
to
clear
slums
and
help
colleges
build
dormitories
.

Mr.
Delaney
and
Mr.
O'Neill
are
not
willing
to
vote
on
the
public-school
measure
until
the
defense
education
bill
clears
the
House
Education
and
Labor
Committee
.

About
half
of
all
Peace
Corps
projects
assigned
to
voluntary
agencies
will
be
carried
out
by
religious
groups
,
according
to
an
official
of
the
corps
.

Twelve
projects
proposed
by
private
groups
are
at
the
contract-negotiation
stage
,
Gordon
Boyce
,
director
of
relations
with
the
voluntary
agencies
,
said
in
a
Washington
interview
.

They
will
be
for
teaching
,
agriculture
and
community
development
in
Southeast
Asia
,
Africa
,
the
Middle
East
and
Latin
America
.

The
hotel
owner
shrugged
.

And
then
,
some
churchmen
remarked
,
there
is
a
more
classical
church-state
problem
:

No
religious
group
,
he
declared
in
an
interview
,
will
receive
Peace
Corps
funds
unless
it
forswears
all
proselytizing
on
the
project
it
proposes
.

In
1960
more
than
6,000
Communist
technicians
were
present
in
those
countries
.

This
was
disclosed
today
by
a
responsible
source
amid
intensified
efforts
by
the
Soviet
Union
to
gain
a
greater
role
in
the
staff
and
operation
of
the
United
Nations
.

India
is
the
most
populous
United
Nations
member
with
more
than
400,000,000
inhabitants
.

The
new
formula
for
filling
staff
positions
in
the
Secretariat
is
one
of
a
number
of
recommendations
made
by
a
panel
of
eight
in
a
long
and
detailed
report
.

The
report
was
completed
after
nearly
eighteen
months
of
work
on
the
question
of
the
organization
of
the
United
Nations
.

The
three
leaders
of
Laos
agreed
today
to
begin
negotiations
tomorrow
on
forming
a
coalition
government
that
would
unite
the
war-ridden
kingdom
.

Their
joint
statement
was
welcomed
by
the
Western
delegations
who
will
attend
tomorrow
the
nineteenth
plenary
session
of
the
fourteen-nation
conference
on
the
future
of
Laos
.

The
pace
of
the
talks
has
slowed
with
each
passing
week
.

The
three
Laotians
agreed
upon
a
six-point
agenda
for
their
talks
,
which
are
to
last
three
days
.

While
in
the
service
he
attended

school
at

.

Washington

Pennsylvania
Avenue
,
named
for
one
of
the
original
13
states
,
perhaps
is
not
the
most
impressive
street
in
the
District
of
Columbia
from
a
commercial
standpoint
.

Many
buildings

In
the
1920
presidential
election
they
had
that
right
and
many
of
them
did
vote
for
the
first
time
.

In
this
historic
square
are
several
statues
,
but
the
one
that
stands
out
over
the
others
is
that
of
Gen.
Andrew
Jackson
,
hero
of
the
Battle
of
New
Orleans
.

Moving
past
the
presidential
viewing
stand
and
Lafayette
Square
will
be
at
least
40
marching
units
.

Division
one
of
the
parade
will
be
the
service
academies
.

Then
will
come
nine
other
states
in
the
order
of
their
admission
to
the
union
.

division
four
will
be
headed
by
the
Navy
,
followed
by
11
states
;
;

Even
for
those
who
have
been
observing
the
political
scene
a
long
time
,
no
script
from
the
past
is
worth
very
much
in
gazing
into
the
state's
immediate
political
future
.

Consequently
,
it
is
uncertain
after
nearly
12
months
in
office
just
which
direction
the
Barnett
administration
will
take
in
the
coming
year
.

Barnett
is
not
expected
to
be
able
to
withstand
the
pressure
.

The
issue
which
may
make
it
necessary
to
have
a
session
is
the
highly
sensitive
problem
of
cutting
the
state's
congressional
districts
from
six
to
five
to
eliminate
one
congressional
seat
.

With
eyes
focused
on
the
third
congressional
district
,
the
historic
Delta
district
,
and
Congressman
Frank
E.
Smith
as
the
one
most
likely
to
go
,
the
redistricting
battle
will
put
to
a
test
the
longstanding
power
which
lawmakers
from
the
Delta
have
held
in
the
Legislature
.

Future
clouded

Barnett
,
as
the
titular
head
of
the
Democratic
party
,
apparently
must
make
the
move
to
reestablish
relations
with
the
national
Democratic
party
or
see
a
movement
come
from
the
loyalist
ranks
to
completely
bypass
him
as
a
party
functionary
.

--
The
Gov.
Jimmie
H.
Davis
administration
appears
to
face
a
difficult
year
in
1961
,
with
the
governor's
theme
of
peace
and
harmony
subjected
to
severe
stresses
.

Indeed
,
the
administration's
curious
position
on
the
sales
tax
was
a
major
factor
in
contributing
to
its
defeat
.

The
effectiveness
of
the
governor
in
clearing
up
some
of
the
inconsistencies
revolving
about
the
sales
tax
bill
may
play
a
part
in
determining
whether
it
can
muster
the
required
two-thirds
vote
.

Actually
,
Davis
would
have
to
toss
in
the
towel
soon
anyway
.

This
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
most
politicos
would
care
to
acknowledge
publicly
.

It
is
difficult
to
be
certain
how
the
administration
views
that
$28
million
,
since
the
views
of
one
leader
may
not
be
the
same
as
the
views
of
another
one
.

If
the
administration
does
not
succeed
in
passing
the
sales
tax
bill
,
or
any
other
tax
bill
,
it
could
very
well
be
faced
this
spring
at
the
fiscal
session
of
the
Legislature
with
an
interesting
dilemma
.

In
either
case
,
it
could
call
a
special
session
of
the
Legislature
later
in
1961
to
make
another
stab
at
raising
additional
revenues
through
a
tax
raiser
.

A
constant
problem
confronting
Davis
on
any
proposals
for
new
taxes
will
be
the
charge
by
his
foes
that
he
has
not
tried
to
economize
.

City
Controller
Alexander
Hemphill
charged
Tuesday
that
the
bids
on
the
Frankford
Elevated
repair
project
were
rigged
to
the
advantage
of
a
private
contracting
company
which
had
``
an
inside
track
''
with
the
city
.

Estimates
of
the
city's
loss
in
the
$344,000
job
have
ranged
as
high
as
$200,000
.

The
Hughes
concern
then
took
``
shortcuts
''
on
the
project
but
got
paid
anyway
,
Hemphill
said
.

The
Philadelphia
Transportation
Co.
is
investigating
the
part
its
organization
played
in
reviewing
the
project
.

The
signature
of
Harold
V.
Varani
,
former
director
of
architecture
and
engineering
in
the
Department
of
Public
Property
,
appeared
on
payment
vouchers
certifying
work
on
the
project
.

The
announcement
that
the
city
would
sue
for
recovery
on
the
performance
bond
was
made
by
City
Solicitor
David
Berger
at
a
press
conference
following
a
meeting
in
the
morning
with
Wagner
and
other
officials
of
the
city
and
the
PTC
as
well
as
representatives
of
an
engineering
firm
that
was
pulled
off
the
El
project
before
its
completion
in
1959
.

Hemphill
said
the
Hughes
concern
contracted
to
do
the
repairs
at
a
cost
of
$500
for
each
joint
.

Berger
insisted
that
``
we
know
enough
to
sue
for
the
full
amount
''
.

``
We
want
to
find
out
who
knew
about
it
''
,
Pratt
said
.

The
ordinance
would
increase
the
fee
for
rooming
houses
,
hotels
and
multi-family
dwellings
to
$5
a
room
.

The
cost
of
a
license
now
is
$2
,
with
an
annual
renewal
fee
of
$1
.

Goodis
said
that
single
rooms
account
for
95
percent
of
the
accomodations
in
some
hotels
.

The
increase
also
was
opposed
by
Leonard
Kaplan
,
spokesman
for
the
Home
Builders
Association
of
Philadelphia
,
on
behalf
of
association
members
who
operate
apartment
houses
.

A
proposal
to
raise
dog
license
fees
drew
an
objection
from
Councilwoman
Virginia
Knauer
,
who
formerly
raised
pedigreed
dogs
.

The
ordinance
would
increase
fees
from
$1
for
males
and
$2
for
females
to
a
flat
$5
a
dog
.

In
reply
,
Deputy
Police
Commissioner
Howard
R.
Leary
said
that
the
city
spends
more
than
$115,000
annually
to
license
and
regulate
dogs
but
collects
only
$43,000
in
fees
.

He
reported
that
the
city's
contributions
for
animal
care
included
$67,000
to
the
Women's
S.P.C.A.
;
;

$15,000
to
pay
six
policemen
assigned
as
dog
catchers
and
$15,000
to
investigate
dog
bites
.

The
corporation
was
formed
by
the
Reynolds
Metal
Co.
and
the
Samuel
A.
and
Henry
A.
Berger
firm
,
a
Philadelphia
builder
,
for
work
in
the
project
.

Would
bar
vehicles

The
plan
for
eliminating
traffic
hazards
for
pedestrians
was
developed
by
Dr.
Constantinos
A.
Doxiadis
,
former
Minister
of
Reconstruction
in
Greece
and
a
consulting
planner
for
the
New
Eastwick
Corp.
.

The
esplanade
would
feature
pedestrian
bridges
over
roads
in
the
project
.

The
explosion
sent
the
hood
of
the
car
flying
over
the
roof
of
the
house
.

It
was
first
believed
the
bomb
was
rigged
to
the
car's
starter
.

The
fire
department
here
has
been
torn
for
months
by
dissension
involving
top
personnel
and
the
fight
between
the
fire
fighters
association
and
the
teamsters
union
.

Led

on

Gen.
Gursel
has
headed
the
military
junta
the
last
17
months
.

The
military
also
had
demanded
pledges
that
there
would
be
no
changes
in
the
laws
passed
by
the
junta
and
no
leaders
of
the
Menderes
regime
now
in
prison
would
be
pardoned
.

Party
leaders
came
out
of
the
final
meeting
apparently
satisfied
and
stated
that
complete
agreement
had
been
reached
on
a
solution
to
the
crisis
created
by
the
elections
which
left
no
party
with
enough
strength
to
form
a
government
on
its
own
.

Martin
,
who
has
been
in
office
in
Washington
,
D.
C.
,
for
13
months
spoke
at
the
council's
annual
meeting
at
the
Multnomah
Hotel
.

He
told
some
350
persons
that
the
United
States'
challenge
was
to
help
countries
build
their
own
societies
their
own
ways
,
following
their
own
paths
.

He
cited
East
Germany
where
after
15
years
of
Soviet
rule
it
has
become
necessary
to
build
a
wall
to
keep
the
people
in
,
and
added
,
``
so
long
as
people
rebel
,
we
must
not
give
up
''
.

Individual
help
best

``
We
have
no
reason
to
fear
failure
,
but
we
must
be
extraordinarily
patient
''
,
the
assistant
secretary
said
.

Private
business
is
more
effective
than
government
aid
,
he
explained
,
because
individuals
are
able
to
work
with
the
people
themselves
.

Chairman
C.
Richard
Mears
pointed
out
that
perhaps
this
was
not
strictly
a
school
board
problem
,
in
case
of
atomic
attack
,
but
that
the
board
would
cooperate
so
far
as
possible
to
get
the
children
to
where
the
parents
wanted
them
to
go
.

``
Nobody
really
expects
to
evacuate
.

Mrs.
Molvar
asked
again
that
the
board
join
in
taking
a
stand
in
keeping
with
Jack
Lowe's
program
.

The
board
said
it
thought
it
had
gone
as
far
as
instructed
so
far
and
asked
for
more
information
to
be
brought
at
the
next
meeting
.

Kenny
Lane
of
Muskegon
,
Mich.
,
world's
seventh
ranked
lightweight
,
had
little
trouble
in
taking
a
unanimous
decision
over
Rip
Randall
of
Tyler
,
Tex.
,
here
Monday
night
.

It
was
Gardner's
second
run
batted
in
of
the
game
and
his
only
ones
of
the
year
.

The
White
Sox
had
taken
a
5-4
lead
in
the
top
of
the
sixth
on
a
pair
of
pop
fly
hits
--
a
triple
by
Roy
Sievers
and
single
by
Camilo
Carreon
--
a
walk
and
a
sacrifice

.

Jim
Landis'
380-foot
home
run
over
left
in
the
first
inning
gave
the
Sox
a
1-0
lead
,
but
Harmon
Killebrew
came
back
in
the
bottom
of
the
first
with
his
second
homer
in
two
days
with
the
walking
Bob
Allison
aboard
.

Suddenly
my
reflexes
are
gone
.

And
so
it
was
over
the
weekend
what
with
40-year-old
Warren
Spahn
pitching
his
no-hit
masterpiece
against
the
Giants
and
the
Giants'
Willie
Mays
retaliating
with
a
record-tying
4-homer
spree
Sunday
.

And
one
of
the
Milwaukee
rookies
sighed
and
remarked
,
``
Wish
I
was
40
,
and
a
top-grade
big
leaguer
.

The
modest
and
happy
Spahn
waved
off
his
new
laurels
as
one
of
those
good
days
.

Ed
Delahanty
and
Chuck
Klein
of
the
Phillies
,
the
Braves'
Joe
Adcock
,
Lou
Gehrig
of
the
Yankees
,
Pat
Seerey
of
the
White
Sox
and
Rocky
Colavito
,
then
with
Cleveland
,
made
their
history
on
the
road
.

Once
the
figure
was
30-30
.

It
will
forever
be
a
baseball
mystery
how
a
team
will
suddenly
start
hitting
after
a
distressing
slump
.

This
dissatisfaction
led
to
Howsam's
request
that
the
video
not
be
terminated
before
the
end
of
the
game
.

The
Yanks
also
took
advantage
of
three
Cincinnati
errors
.

The
crowd
of
32,589
had
only
two
chances
to
applaud
.

The
Yankee
triumph
made
Ralph
Houk
only
the
third
man
to
lead
a
team
to
both
a
pennant
and
a
World
Series
victory
in
his
first
year
as
a
manager
.

The
appointment
was
announced
at
a
news
conference
at
which
Skorich
said
he
would
retain
two
members
of
Shaw's
staff
--
Jerry
Williams
and
Charlie
Gauer
.

The
selection
had
been
expected
.

Philadelphia
permitted
him
to
seek
a
better
connection
after
he
had
refused
to
reconsider
his
decision
to
end
his
career
as
a
player
.

He
was
there
one
season
before
rejoining
the
Steelers
as
an
assistant
coach
.

Skorich
began
his
new
job
auspiciously
today
.

To
Spahn
will
go
the
Sid
Mercer
Memorial
Award
as
the
chapter's
player
of
the
year
.

His
goal
was
to
obtain
a
National
League
team
for
this
city
.

When
that
failed
,
he
enlisted
Branch
Rickey's
aid
in
the
formation
of
a
third
major
league
,
the
Continental
,
with
New
York
as
the
key
franchise
.

Arnold
Palmer
and
Sam
Snead
will
be
among
those
honored
at
the
national
awards
dinner
of
the
Metropolitan
Golf
Writers
Association
tonight
.

Palmer
,
golf's
leading
money-winner
in
1960
,
and
Snead
will
be
saluted
as
the
winning
team
in
the
Canada
Cup
matches
last
June
in
Dublin
.

A
couple
of
weeks
ago
,
he
scored
a
monstrous
12
on
a
par-5
hole
.

If
such
a
paragon
of
perfection
as
Palmer
could
commit
such
a
scoring
sacrilege
,
there
was
hope
left
for
all
.

On
the
narrow
fairway
of
a
508-yard
hole
,
Arnold
whipped
into
his
second
shot
.

He
tried
again
and
once
more
sliced
out
of
bounds
.

Willie's
partner
was
Long
Jim
Barnes
,
who
tried
to
keep
count
.

Stickler
for
rules

``
How
many
is
that
,
Jim
''
?
?

If
there
had
been
,
he
would
have
found
a
loophole
,
because
Arnold
is
one
golfer
who
knows
the
code
as
thoroughly
as
the
man
who
wrote
the
book
.

His
first
shot
in
the
Open
last
year
landed
in
a
brook
that
flowed
along
the
right
side
of
the
fairway
.

Arnold
sent
for
Joe
Dey
,
the
executive
secretary
of
the
golf
association
.

For
a
serious
young
man
who
plays
golf
with
a
serious
intensity
,
Palmer
has
such
an
inherent
sense
of
humor
that
it
relieves
the
strain
and
keeps
his
nerves
from
jangling
like
banjo
strings
.

It
happened
on
the
twelfth
hole
,
a
155-yarder
.

``
I'll
do
as
you
say
,
but
I'll
also
play
a
provisional
ball
and
get
a
ruling
''
.

Until
a
few
weeks
ago
,
however
,
Arnold
Palmer
was
some
god-like
creature
who
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
duffers
.

However
,
this
would
require
a
lengthening
of
the
season
from
thirteen
to
fourteen
weeks
.

Pete
Rozelle
,
the
league
commissioner
,
pointed
out
:

Change
in
pitchers
.

Manager
Hemus
,
eager
to
end
a
pitching
slump
that
has
brought
four
losses
in
the
five
games
on
the
current
home
stand
,
moved
Gibson
to
the
Wednesday
night
starting
assignment
.

After
a
lengthy
workout
yesterday
,
an
open
date
,
Hemus
said
that
Bob
Nieman
definitely
would
stay
in
the
lineup
.

Despite
the

,

On
last
May
1
,
the
Cardinals
stood
at
7-6
,
ending
a
two-season
fall-off
on
that
milestone
.

Those
Dodgers
won
their
first
10
games
and
owned
a
21-2
mark
and
a
nine-game
lead
by
May
8
.

They
honored
the
battling
Billikens
last
night
.

The
trio
who
shared
the
most-valuable
honors
were
introduced
by
Bob
Broeg
,
sports
editor
of
the
Post-Dispatch
.

Mankowski
,
the
ball-hawking
defensive
expert
,
was
cited
for
his
performance
against
Bradley
in
St.
Louis
U.'s
nationally
televised
victory
.

Bob
Burnes
,
sports
editor
of
the
Globe-Democrat
,
presented
Bob
Nordmann
with
his
award
.

On
the
clock
given
him
was
the
inscription
,
``
For
Outstanding
Contribution
to
Billiken
Basketball
,
1960-61
''
.

Larry
Scherer
last
night
pitched
a
no-hit
game
,
said
to
be
the
first
in
Billiken
baseball
history
,
as
the
Blue
and
White
beat
Southeast
Missouri
State
College
,
5-1
,
at
Crystal
City
.

St.
Louis
U.
was
to
be
in
action
again
today
with
a
game
scheduled
at
4
against
Washington
University
at
Ligget
Field
.

The
game
opened
a
busy
week
for
Washington
.

His
best
years
were
1954
when
he
hit
with
41
homers
and
'55
when
he
belted
51
home
runs
,
drove
in
127
and
stole
24
bases
.

Now
,
apparently
happier
under
new
managers
,
Mays
and
Mantle
,
the
perfect
players
,
are
behaving
as
though
they're
going
to
pass
those
previous
peaks
.

Yes
,
we
know
,
they're
professionals
,
men
paid
to
play
,
and
they
shouldn't
care
how
they're
handled
,
just
as
long
as
their
names
are
spelled
correctly
on
the
first
and
fifteenth
of
each
month
.

Mantle
,
it's
apparent
,
resented
Casey
Stengel's
attempts
to
push
and
prod
him
into
the
perfection
the
veteran
manager
saw
as
a
thrilling
possibility
.

Stengel
probably
preached
too
much
in
the
early
days
when
the
kid
wanted
to
pop
his
bubble
gum
and
sow
his
oats
.

And
what
leadership
a
proud
Mantle
has
given
so
far
.

They
will
take
a
wedding
trip

A

Back
to
w.
coast

Mrs.
John
C.
Vroman
Jr.
of
Manzanola
is
spending
several
days
in
her
Sherman
Plaza
apartment
.

Mr.
and
Mrs.
Merrill
Shoup
have
returned
to
their
home
in
Colorado
Springs
after
spending
a
few
days
at
the
Brown
Palace
Hotel
.

Her
position
covers
a
number
of
daily
tasks
common
to
any
social
director
.

By
mid-June
,
millions
of
Americans
will
take
to
the
road
on
vacation
trips
up
and
down
and
back
and
forth
across
this
vast
and
lovely
land
.

In
another
four
weeks
,
with
schools
closed
across
the
nation
,
the
great
all-American
summer
safari
will
be
under
way
.

No
matter
how
many
Americans
go
abroad
in
summer
,
probably
a
hundred
times
as
many
gas
up
the
family
car
,
throw
suitcases
,
kids
and
comic
books
in
the
back
seat
,
and
head
for
home
.

And
where
is
``
home
''
,
that
magic
place
of
the
heart
?
?

There
are
even
motels
for
local
weather
peculiarities
in
Shamrock
,
Tex.
,
as
I
discovered
.

Motorists
like
myself
who
can
remember
the
old
``
tourists
accommodated
''
signs
on
farm
houses
and
village
homes
before
World
War
2
,
can
only
marvel
at
the
great
size
and
the
luxury
of
the
relatively
new
and
fast-grossing
motel
business
.

At
the
Boxwood
Motel
in
Winchester
,
Va.
,
we
accidentally
drew
the
honeymoon
suite
,
an
elegant
affair
with
wall-to-wall
carpeting
,
gold
and
white
furniture
,
pink
satin
brocade
chairs
,
24-inch
TV
and
a
pink
tile
bath
with
masses
of
pink
towels
.

All
for
$14
.

That
made
up
for
the
``
best
''
motel
in
Norman
,
Okla.
,
where
the
proprietor
knocked
$2
off
the
$8.50
tab
when
we
found
ants
in
the
pressed-paper
furniture
.

The
bridegroom
is
the
son
of
Mrs.
James
Baines
of
Los
Angeles
,
Calif.
,
and
Carl
E.
Howard
of
Santa
Monica
,
Calif.
.

Cecil
Mason
of

Baker

,
of
Houston
,
Dr.
James
Carter
of
Houston
and
Conrad
McEachern
of
New
Orleans
,
La.
.

Her
veil
was
caught
to
a
pearl
headdress
,
and
she
carried
stephanotis
and
orchids
.

Miss
Glenda
Kay
Meredith
of
Denton
was
her
sister's
maid
of
honor
,
and
Vernon
Lewelleyn
of
San
Angelo
was
best
man
.

The
First
Christian
Church

Earl
Loving

,
who
will
live
at

The

``

says
Mrs.
Grinsfelder

``
that

The

that
the

detail
detectives
``
is
the
product

rumor
,
combined
with
malice

was
made
yesterday
in
their
conspiracy
trial
before
Judge
Joseph
Sam
Perry
in

District
court
.

This
,
he
added
,
brought
about
``

``

In

D.

Lives
on
welfare

Hengesbach
,
who
has
been
living
on
welfare
recently
,
said
he
hopes
to
rebuild
the
farm
which
was
settled
by
his
grandfather
in
Westphalia
,
27
miles
southwest
of
here
.

Hengesbach
has
been
living
in
Grand
Ledge
since
his
house
and
barn
were
burned
down
after
his
release
in
1958
.

Locked
in
motel

The
jury
,
which
was
locked
up
in
a
motel
overnight
,
was
canvassed
at
the
request
of
Walker
after
the
verdict
was
announced
.

She
said
the
jurors
agreed
that
Pohl's
confession
was
valid
.

Some
30
spectators
remained
in
the
court
during
the
day
and
were
on
hand
to
hear
the
verdict
read
.

A
Sterling
Township
family
of

surviving

,
whose
mother
died
yesterday
as
the
aftermath

also
killed
one
of
the
children
,
found
today
they
had
the
help
of
hundreds
of
neighbors

school
friends

The
mother
and
daughter
,
who
will
be
buried
side

Held
candle

Assistant
Fire
Chief
Chester
Cornell
said
gas
fumes
apparently
were
ignited
by
a
candle
which
one
of
the
three
Kowalski
girls
present
held
for
her
mother
,
because
the
flat
lacked
electricity
.

Christine's
twin
sister
,
Patricia
,
and
Darlene
Kowalski
,

,
escaped
with
minor
burns
.

``
All
we
have
left
in
the
world
is
one
another
,
and
we
must
stay
together
the
way
Mother
wanted
''
,
Kowalski
said
in
telling
his
children
of
their
mother's
death
yesterday
afternoon
.

Kowalski
,
a
roofer
who
seldom
worked
last
winter
,
already
was
in
arrears
on
their
recently
purchased
split-level
home
when
the
tragedy
staggered
him
with
medical
and
funeral
bills
.

John
C.
Houghton
,
president
of
the
Tareytown
Acres
Homeowners
Association
,
followed
that
by
announcing
plans
last
night
for
a
door-to-door
fund
drive
throughout
their
subdivision
on
behalf
of
the
Kowalski
family
.

Houghton
said
6
p.m.
Friday
had
been
set
for
a
canvass
of
all
480
homes
in
the
subdivision
,
which
is
located
northeast
of
Dequindre
and
14
Mile
Road
East
.

``
Furhmann's
faculty
is
proud
that
this
has
been
a
spontaneous
effort
,
started
largely
among
the
students
themselves
,
because
of
fondness
for
Vicky
and
sympathy
for
her
entire
family
,
Pohly
said
.

There
also
were
reports
of
a
collection
at
the
County
Line
Elementary
School
,
3505o
Dequindre
,
which
has
been
attended
this
year
by
four
of
the
Kowalski
children
including
Christine
.

An
alert
10-year-old
safety
patrol
boy
was
congratulated
by
police
today
for
his
part
in
obtaining
a
reckless
driving
conviction
against
a
youthful
motorist
.

Returning
to
the
school
crossing
,
the
officer
was
informed
by
the
Sisk
boy
that
he
recognized
the
driver
,
a
neighbor
,
and
had
obtained
the
license
number
.

Given
15
days

He
was
found
guilty
of
reckless
driving
yesterday
by
Traffic
Judge
George
T.
Murphy
,
who
continued
his
no-driving
probation
for
another
year
and
ordered
him
to
spend
15
days
in
the
Detroit
House
of
Correction
.

The
long
crisis
in
Laos
appeared
nearing
a
showdown
today
.

He
indicated
that
requests
would
be
made
for
more
U.S.
arms
and
more
U.S.
military
advisers
.

Heavy
support

The
Laos
government
said
four
major
Pathet
Lao
rebel
attacks
had
been
launched
,
heavily
supported
by
troops
from
Communist
North
Viet
Nam
.

The
minister
,
describing
the
attacks
which
led
up
to
the
appeal
,
said
that
60,000
Communist
North
Vietnamese
were
fighting
royal
army
troops
on
one
front
--
near
Thakhek
,
in
southern-central
Laos
.

The
executions
took
place
at
dawn
only
a
few
hours
after
Havana
radio
announced
their
conviction
by
a
revolutionary
tribunal
at
Pinar
Del
Rio
,
where
the
executions
took
place
.

McNair
,
25
,
was
seized
March
20
with
four
Cubans
and
accused
of
trying
to
land
a
boatload
of
rifles
in
Pinar
Del
Rio
,
about
35
miles
from
Havana
.

Among
them
were
a
number
of
newsmen
,
including
Henry
Raymont
,
of
United
Press
International
,
and
Robert
Berrellez
,
of
Associated
Press
.

The
statement
explained
that
under
the
Georgia
Constitution
and
state
law
,
tax-exempt
status
is
granted
to
educational
institutions
only
if
they
are
segregated
.

At
least
two
private
colleges
in
the
Atlanta
area
now
or
in
the
past
have
had
integrated
student
bodies
,
but
their
tax-exempt
status
never
has
been
challenged
by
the
state
.

On
the
other
hand

University

A
young
man
was
killed
and
two
others
injured
at
midnight
Friday
when
the
car
they
were
riding
slid
into
a
utility
pole
on
Lake
Avenue
near
Waddell
Street
,
NE
,
police
said
.

The
demands
were
set
forth
in
letters
to
seven
owners
of
first-run
theaters
by
the
Committee
on
Appeal
for
Human
Rights
.

'
intend
to
attend
'

They
indicated
that
stand-ins
and
picketing
would
be
started
if
theater
owners
failed
to
cooperate
.

However
,
three
of
the
managers
did
say
that
they
would
agree
to
attend
the
proposed
meeting
if
all
of
the
other
managers
decided
to
attend
.

Several
theater
operators
said
,
however
,
that
there
is
little
likelihood
of
the
subject
being
discussed
during
the
three-day
affair
.

:

The

,
and
after
an
argument
struck
his
uncle
with
a

Seventeen
years
ago
today
,
German
scientist
Willy
Fiedler
climbed
into
a
makeshift
cockpit
installed
in
a
V-1
rocket-bomb
that
was
attached
to
the
underbelly
of
a
Heinkel
bomber
.

Now
a
quiet-spoken
,
middle-aged
man
,
Fiedler
is
an
aeronautical
engineer
for
Lockheed's
Missiles
and
Space
Division
at
Sunnyvale
,
where
he
played
a
key
role
in
the
development
of
the
Navy's
Polaris
missile
.

``
I
had
developed
the
machines
and
therefore
knew
them
.

About
200
of
the
special
V-1
rocket-bombs
were
to
be
made
ready
for
manned
flight
with
an
explosive
warhead
.

The
target
was
Allied
shipping
--
a
desperate
effort
to
stave
off
the
Allied
invasion
of
Europe
.

Moments
later
the
V-1
skimmed
across
the
landing
strip
,
edging
closer
and
closer
to
a
touchdown
--
then
in
a
streamer
of
dust
it
landed
.

Fiedler
went
on
to
make
several
other
test
flights
before
German
pilots
took
over
the
Reichenberg
missiles
.

A
crack
corps
of
50
pilots
was
formed
from
the
ranks
of
volunteers
,
but
the
project
was
halted
before
the
end
of
the
war
,
and
the
missiles
later
fell
into
Allied
hands

Curtis

,

of

Lake

was
arrested
yesterday
on

charging
him
with
embezzling
an
undetermined
amount
of
money
from
the
First
Federal
Savings
and
Loan
association
,
1
S.
Dearborn
St.
,
where
he
formerly
was
employed
as
an
attorney
.

On
that
date
,
according
to
Gregorio
,
Huff
left
his
home
and
took
a
room
in
the
New
Lawrence
hotel
at
1020
Lawrence
Av.
.

it
was
more
one
of
allotting
a
few
shares
to
a
number
of
customers
and
explaining
to
others
why
they
had
no
more
to
sell
.

The
stock
was
sold
in
the
underwriting
at
a
price
of
$12.50
a
share
.

And
from
that
the
stock
moved
right
on
up
until
it
was
trading
Thursday
morning
at
around
$22
a
share
.

Letters
by
the
reams
came
in
from
investment
firms
all
over
the
nation
,
all
of
them
wanting
to
get
a
part
of
the
shares
that
would
be
sold
(
185,000
to
the
public
at
$12.50
,
with
another
5,000
reserved
for
Morton
Foods
employes
at
$11.50
a
share
)
.

Second
,
the
``
potato
chip
industry
''
has
caught
the
fancy
of
investors
lately
,
and
until
Morton
Foods
came
along
there
were
only
two
potato
chip
stocks
--
Frito
and
H.
W.
Lay
--
on
the
market
.

The
potato
chip
industry
these
days
is
growing
,
not
only
as
a
result
of
population
increase
and
public
acceptance
of
convenience
foods
,
but
also
because
of
a
combination
of
circumstances
that
has
led
to
growth
by
merger
.

Those
that
remain
are
those
that
were
headed
by
strong
executives
,
men
with
the
abilities
to
last
almost
30
years
in
the
competitive
survival
of
the
fittest
.

The
Murray
Co.
of
Texas
,
Inc.
,
originated
in
Dallas
in
1896
.

The
present
company
is
a
combination
of
several
smaller
ones
that
date
back
to
1834
.

The
company
sells
a
complete
line
of
gin
machinery
all
over
the
cotton-growing
world
.

The
firm
recently
expanded
domestic
sales
into
the
Southeastern
states
as
a
result
of
an
agreement
with
Cen-Tennial
Gin
Co.
.

In
1930
,
they
began
making
cotton
processing
equipment
.

The
Hinckley
Gin
Supply
Co.
is
a
maker
of
``
overhead
equipment
''
.

They
make
gin
saws
and
deal
in
parts
,
supplies
and
some
used
gin
machinery
.

They've
been
in
Dallas
since
1921
.

With
the
March
pickup
,
dealers
are
optimistic
that
the
April-June
quarter
will
equal
or
top
last
year
.

The
March
gain
plus
this
optimism
has
been
encouraging
enough
to
prompt
auto
makers
to
boost
production
schedules
for
the
next
quarter
.

Thesis
refuted

The
economist
does
not
look
for
a
drastic
switch
in
the
budget
during
this
recovery
and
believes
it
``
even
more
unlikely
that
the
Federal
Reserve
will
aggressively
tighten
monetary
policy
in
the
early
phases
of
the
upturn
as
was
the
case
in
1958
''
.

It
was
a
level
at
which
some
of
the
investors
standing
on
the
sidelines
were
thought
likely
to
buy
the
pivotal
issues
represented
in
the
averages
.

Some
good
news

A
substantial
rise
in
new
orders
and
sales
of
durable
goods
was
reported
for
last
month
.

The
Dow
Jones
industrial
average
advanced
7.19
to
687.87
.

New
highs
for
the
year
totaled
nine
and
new
lows
14
.

Trading
was
comparatively
dull
throughout
the
day
.

``
With
this
kind
of
new
product
log-jam
,
the
premium
for
brilliant
product
planning
will
obviously
go
up
geometrically
''
.

Nothing
to
fear

He
cited
,
as
an
example
,
how
the
American
camera
industry
has
been
able
to
meet
successfully
the
competition
of
Japan
despite
lower
Japanese
labor
costs
,
by
improving
its
production
know-how
and
technology
.

Union
Oil

by
Dillon
,

&
Co.
,
to
raise
money
to
retire

similar
amount
held

could
have
been
converted
into

the
bank
in
March
and
wrote
a
story
about
the
situation
.

reply

inquiries

Washington
(
UPI
)

Perlman
said
bankruptcy
would
not
be
an
immediate
effect
of
the
merger
,
but
could
possibly
be
an
ultimate
effect
.

The
railroad
president
made
the
statement
in
an
interview
as
the
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
opened
Round
2
of
its
hearing
into
the
C
&
O's
request
to
control
and
then
merge
with
the
B
&
Aj
.

``
All
these
kind
of
things
weaken
us
''
,
Perlman
said
.

Central
was
rebuffed
by
the
other
two
railroads
in
previous
attempts
to
make
it
a
three-way
merger
.

The
proposed
C
&
O-B
&
O
railroad
would
make
it
the
hemisphere's
second
largest
.

Washington
,
March

(

.

The
poll
was
taken
at
the
Center's
annual
builders'
intentions
conference
.

It
disclosed
that
the
builders
:

Expect
their
own
production
volume
,
and
presumably
sales
,
to
jump
30
percent
in
1961
.

Starts
were
down
20
percent
from
1959
.

We
sold
only
four
pickers
all
last
year
''
.

Paradoxically
,
the
sales
rise
is
due
in
large
measure
to
Government
efforts
to
slash
farm
output
.

For
the
year
to
date
,
sales
of
the
company's
farm
equipment
dealers
still
lag
about
5%
behind
1960
.

Not
all
sections
are
showing
an
upswing
,
however
;
;

More
than
20
million
people
live
on
farms
and
they
own
a
fourth
of
the
nation's
trucks
,
buy
more
gasoline
than
any
other
industry
and
provide
a
major
market
for
home
appliances
,
chemicals
and
other
products
.

Tractor
production
at
Massey-Ferguson
,
Ltd.
,
of
Toronto
in
July
and
August
rose
to
2,418
units
from
869
in
the
like
period
a
year
earlier
,
says
John
Staiger
,
vice
president
.

Price
support
loans
may
total
another
$1
billion
this
year
.

The
court
held
that
the
tax
applied
to
non-profit
sales
because
the
corporations
realized
economic
benefits
by
doing
business
as
two
separate
entities
.

Adjusted
sales
that
month
were
up
a
relatively
steep
2.5%
from
those
of
the
month
before
,
which
in
turn
were
slightly
higher
than
the
January
low
of

A

when

to
a

end

most
people
don't
seem
to
realize
,
if

is
that
90%
of
the
problem
is
transportation

It
seems
like
only
last

that
we
watched
them
set
out
up

on

rainy
day
in
their
yellow
raincoats
to
finger-paint
at

it

home

As
he
approached

open
bandstand

erected
facing
the
South
entrance
to

the
band
struck
up
the
``

followed
it
with
``
Hail
To
The
Chief

.

After
paying
tribute
to
the
conductor
and
his
white-clad
youthful
students
,
President
Kennedy
said
,
``
As

American

have
the

possible
pride

devoted
teachers
are
studying
with
interested
young
men

opening
up

``
This
is

One
of
the
most
interested
``
students
''
on
the
tour
which
the
Brevard
group
took
at
the
National
Gallery
yesterday
following
their
concert
at
the
White
House
,
was
Letitia
Baldrige
,
social
secretary
to
First
Lady
Jacqueline
Kennedy
.

They
decided
that
they
thought
Rembrandt's
self-portrait
made
him
look
``
sad
''
;
;

Everybody
had
heard
of
Van
Gogh
,
the
French
impressionist
.

Gallery
Director
John
Walker
greeted
the
group
,
standing
on
one
of
the
benches
in
the
downstairs
lobby
to
speak
to
them
.

A
few
of
them
said
they
``
preferred
contemporary
art
''
.

That
imposing
,
somewhat
austere
,
and
seemingly
remote
collonaded
building
with
the
sphynxes
perched
on
its
threshold
at
1733
16th
St.
nw.
took
on
bustling
life
yesterday
.

About
1500
delegates
are
expected
to
register
today
for
the
biennial
session
of
the
Ancient
and
Accepted
Scottish
Rite
for
the
Southern
Jurisdiction
of
the
United
States
.

The
judge
listened
quietly
as
the
young
woman
poured
out
her
frustrations
--
then
discussing
with
her
the
possibility
of
seeking
aid
from
Family
Service
before
going
to
a
lawyer
.

They
are
now
working
together
toward
solving
their
difficulties
.

John
received
a
promotion
in
his
firm
.

Mr.
Kennedy
replied
:

President
Kennedy
will
meet
with
Soviet
Premier
Nikita
S.
Khrushchev
in
Vienna
June
3
and
4
.

That
objective
set
the
high
stakes
and
drama
of
the
Vienna
meeting
.

The
U.
S.
and
Soviet
heads
of
Government
have
met
three
times
since
Sir
Winston
Churchill
in
1953
introduced
a
new
word
into
international
diplomacy
with
his
call
for
a
fresh
approach
to
the
problem
of
peace
``
at
the
summit
of
the
nations
''
.

That
meeting
produced
the
``
spirit
of
Camp
David
''
--
a
spirit
,
it
later
turned
out
,
that
masked
a
basic
misunderstanding
about
progress
toward
a
Berlin
settlement
.

Premier
Khrushchev
wrecked
the
conference
at
its
initial
session
with
a
bitter
denunciation
of
the
U.
S.
for
the
U-2
incident
.

Thus
when
Premier
Khrushchev
intimated
even
before
inauguration
that
he
hoped
for
an
early
meeting
with
the
new
President
,
Mr.
Kennedy
was
confronted
with
a
delicate
problem
.

``
As
long
as
Mr.
Khrushchev
is
convinced
that
the
balance
of
world
power
is
shifting
his
way
,
no
amount
of
either
smiles
or
toughness
,
neither
Camp
David
talks
nor
kitchen
debates
,
can
compel
him
to
enter
fruitful
negotiations
''
.

It
would
give
him
an
opportunity
to
take
the
measure
of
his
chief
adversary
in
the
cold
war
,
to
try
to
probe
Mr.
Khrushchev's
intentions
and
to
make
clear
his
own
views
.

It
dealt
mainly
with
a
broad
range
of
East-West
issues
.

In
the
U.
S.
,
strong
pressures
have
been
building
up
for
a
resumption
of
tests
on
grounds
that
the
Russians
may
be
secretly
testing
.

U.
S.
willingness
to
accept
a
neutral
Laos
may
have
led
Premier
Khrushchev
to
believe
that
other
areas
could
be
``
neutralized
''
on
Soviet
terms
.

The
President
and
his
advisers
felt
that
the
time
might
have
come
to
warn
Premier
Khrushchev
against
a
grave
miscalculation
in
areas
such
as
Berlin
,
Iran
or
Latin
America
from
which
there
would
be
no
turning
back
.

The
response
from
London
,
Paris
and
Bonn
was
favorable
.

Apparently
at
the
insistence
of
the
U.
S.
,
the
simultaneous
announcements
issued
in
Washington
and
Moscow
last
Friday
emphasized
the
``
informal
''
nature
of
the
meeting
.

The
outlook

The
Vienna
meeting
will
bring
together
a
seasoned
,
67-year-old
veteran
of
the
cold
war
who
,
in
Mr.
Kennedy's
own
words
,
is
``
shrewd
,
tough
,
vigorous
,
well-informed
and
confident
''
,
and
a
44-year-old
President
(
his
birthday
is
May
29
)
with
a
demonstrated
capacity
for
political
battle
but
little
experience
in
international
diplomacy
.

The
inclination
was
to
accept
the
statement
that
there
would
be
no
formal
negotiations
.

If
tests
are
to
be
resumed
,
the
argument
went
,
it
is
vital
that
the
U.
S.
make
plain
that
the
onus
belongs
to
the
Soviet
Union
.

There
are
,
so
my
biologist
friends
tell
me
,
mechanisms
of
adaptation
and
defense
that
are
just
too
complete
and
too
satisfactory
.

Though
this
may
or
may
not
be
good
biology
,
it
does
aptly
illustrate
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
American
Catholic
higher
education
.

American
Catholics
have
responded
generously
to
bishops'
and
pastors'
appeals
for
the
support
necessary
to
create
parochial
schools
but
they
have
not
contributed
in
a
similar
fashion
to
the
establishment
of
institutions
of
higher
learning
.

The
net
result
is
a
uniquely
satisfying
sense
of
comradeship
,
the
kind
of
comradeship
which
sparks
enthusiasm
and
blunts
the
cutting
edge
of
sacrifice
and
hardship
.

Had
it
not
been
for
such
private
enterprise
,
diocesan
authorities
might
of
course
have
been
goaded
into
establishing
institutions
subsidized
by
diocesan
funds
and
parish
collections
and
staffed
by
religious
as
paid
employees
.

There
is
however
no
point
in
speculating
about
such
a
possibility
:
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
our
institutions
of
higher
learning
owe
their
existence
to
a
spirit
not
unlike
that
which
produces
the
``
family
business
''
.

Apart
,
however
,
from
the
question
of
wasteful
duplication
,
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
``
family
business
''
spirit
in
American
Catholic
higher
education
which
deserves
closer
scrutiny
.

But
with
today's
demand
for
professional
qualifications
and
specialized
training
,
the
need
for
``
outsiders
''
becomes
more
pressing
.

Commenting
on
the
earlier
stage
,
the
Notre
Dame
Chapter
of
the
American
Association
of
University
Professors
(
in
a
recent
report
on
the
question
of
faculty
participation
in
administrative
decision-making
)
noted
that
the
term
``
teacher-employee
''
(
as
opposed
to
,
e.g.
,
``
maintenance
employee
''
)
was
a
not
inapt
description
.

The
pattern
here
pictured
is
clearly
not
peculiar
to
Notre
Dame
:
it
is
simply
that
the
paradox
involved
in
this
kind
of
control
of
the
institution
by
``
the
organization
which
actually
owns
''
it
,
becomes
more
obvious
where
there
is
a
larger
and
more
distinguished
``
outside
''
faculty
.

To
appreciate
the
nature
of
the
gamble
,
it
should
be
realized
that
while
college
teaching
is
almost
a
public
symbol
of
security
,
that
security
does
not
come
as
quickly
or
as
automatically
as
it
does
in
an
elementary
school
system
or
in
the
Civil
Service
.

Much
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
major
Catholic
institutions
now
guarantee
firm
tenure
.

A
man
does
not
make
that
kind
of
gamble
if
he
suspects
that
one
or
more
of
the
limited
number
of
tenure
positions
is
being
reserved
for
members
of
the
``
family
''
.

Yet
though
it
may
seem
difficult
to
envision
any
definitive
resolution
of
the
problem
of
ownership
and
control
,
there
are
nevertheless
certain
suggestions
which
seem
to
be
in
order
.

In
the
case
of
academic
personnel
the
``
feeling
''
of
participation
can
hardly
be
``
faked
''
.

Competent
teachers
are
well
versed
in
the
technique
of
leading
students
to
pre-set
conclusions
without
destroying
the
students'
illusion
that
they
are
making
their
own
decisions
.

Those
who
have
served
as
faculty
advisers
are
too
familiar
with
the
useful
but
artificial
mechanisms
of
student
government
to
be
taken
in
by
``
busy-work
''
and
ersatz
decision
making
.

Sen.
John
L.
McClellan
of
Arkansas
and
Rep.
David
Martin
of
Nebraska
are
again
beating
the
drums
to
place
the
unions
under
the
anti-monopoly
laws
.

The
committee
remains
unresponsive
.

The
anti-trust
laws
inform
a
business
that
it
must
compete
,
but
along
completely
undefined
lines
;
;

it
must
play
a
game
in
which
there
never
is
a
winner
.

Hypocrisy
thus
becomes
the
answer
to
a
foolish
public
policy
.

Let
us
look
at
the
heavy-electrical-goods
industry
in
which
General
Electric
,
Westinghouse
and
a
number
of
other
manufacturers
were
recently
convicted
of
engaging
in
a
conspiracy
to
rig
prices
and
allocate
the
market
.

Uncle
Sam
would
then
accuse
them
of
creating
a
monopoly
by
``
unfair
competition
''
.

Under
the
circumstances
,
the
only
protection
for
the
relatively
small
manufacturers
is
to
engage
in
exactly
the
kind
of
conspiracy
with
the
giants
for
which
the
latter
were
convicted
.

The
question
might
be
asked
:
``
Don't
the
managements
of
the
heavy-electrical-goods
manufacturers
know
these
facts
?
?

He
wrote
:
``
(
P.
211
)
the
anti-trust
laws
were
the
answer
of
a
society
which
unconsciously
felt
the
need
of
great
organizations
,
and
at
the
same
time
had
to
deny
them
a
place
in
the
moral
and
logical
ideology
of
the
social
structure
.

(
P.
214
)
anti-trust
laws
became
the
greatest
protection
to
uncontrolled
business
dictatorship
.

(
Pp.
228-229
)
in
any
event
,
it
is
obvious
that
the
anti-trust
laws
did
not
prevent
the
formation
of
some
of
the
greatest
financial
empires
the
world
has
ever
known
,
held
together
by
some
of
the
most
fantastic
ideas
,
all
based
on
the
fundamental
notion
that
a
corporation
is
an
individual
who
can
trade
and
exchange
goods
without
control
by
the
government
''
.

(
The
penalties
handed
out
in
the
electrical
case
,
which
included
jail
sentences
,
were
unprecedented
in
anti-trust
prosecutions
,
perhaps
because
the
conspirators
had
displayed
unusual
ineptness
in
their
pricing
activities
.

Those
who
favor
placing
trade
unions
under
anti-trust
laws
imply
that
they
are
advocating
a
brand
new
reform
.

The
tortured
reasoning
that
unions
use
to
deny
their
ambition
to
exercise
monopoly
power
over
the
supply
and
price
of
labor
is
one
of
the
things
that
create
a
legal
profession
.

If
laborers
are
merely
commodities
competing
against
each
other
in
a
market
place
like
so
many
bags
of
wheat
and
corn
(
unsupported
,
by
the
way
,
by
any
agricultural
subsidy
)
,
then
they
may
be
pardoned
for
reacting
with
complete
antagonism
to
a
system
that
imposes
such
status
upon
them
.

The
courts
shared
the
opinion
of
the
employers
.

Paradoxically
,
the
same
week
in
which
Senator
McClellan
was
attempting
to
extend
the
anti-trust
act
to
labor
in
transportation
,
the
Civil
Aeronautics
Board
was
assuring
the
airlines
that
if
they
met
in
concert
to
eliminate
many
costly
features
of
air
travel
,
the
action
would
not
be
deemed
a
violation
of
the
anti-trust
act
.

The
suit
against
the
union
was
successful
and
many
workers
lost
their
homes
to
pay
off
the
judgment
.

The
nation

the
three-front
war

What
Herter
presented
,
said
Gore
,
was
``
not
a
very
encouraging
review
''
.

That
was
something
of
an
understatement
in
a
week
when
the
underlying
conflict
between
the
West
and
Communism
erupted
on
three
fronts
.

President
Eisenhower
held
an
8:30
a.m.
meeting
with
top
military
and
foreign-policy
advisers
,
decided
to
break
off
diplomatic
relations
immediately
.

``
In
view
of
the
present
situation
in
Laos
''
,
said
the
Pentagon's
announcement
,
``
we
are
taking
normal
precautionary
actions
to
increase
the
readiness
of
our
forces
in
the
Pacific
''
.

As
the
87th
Congress
began
its
sessions
last
week
,
liberal
Democrats
were
ready
for
a
finish
fight
to
open
the
sluice
gates
controlled
by
the
House
Rules
Committee
and
permit
the
free
flow
of
liberal
legislation
to
the
floor
.

He
is
generally
and
initially
suspicious
of
any
federal
project
,
unless
it
happens
to
benefit
his
Gulf
Coast
constituents
.

He
is
,
of
course
,
a
segregationist
,
but
he
says
he
has
never
made
an
``
anti-Negro
''
speech
.

For
20
years
he
has
enjoyed
his
power
on
the
Rules
Committee
.

In
a
tense
,
closed-door
session
with
Judge
Smith
,
Rayburn
attempted
to
work
out
a
compromise
:
to
add
three
new
members
to
the
Rules
Committee
(
two
Democrats
,
including
one
Southerner
,
and
one
Republican
)
.

)
In
all
three
arenas
,
they
seemed
certain
of
victory
--
especially
with
Sam
Rayburn
applying
his
whiplash
.

A
wide-ranging
,
bipartisan
force
--
from
Minnesota's
Democratic
Hubert
Humphrey
to
Massachusetts'
Republican
Leverett
Saltonstall
--
was
drawn
up
against
a
solid
phalanx
of
Southern
Democrats
,
who
have
traditionally
used
the
filibuster
to
stop
civil
rights
bills
.

Fair
Dealer
Humphrey
upped
the
ante
,
asked
cloture
power
for
a
mere
majority
of
Senators
.

Georgia's
Dick
Russell
objected
politely
,
and
the
battle
was
joined
.

Privately
,
they
also
admitted
that
their
hopes
for
Clint
Anderson's
three-fifths
modification
depended
on
none
other
than
Republican
Richard
Nixon
.

Armed
with
the
Nixon
opinion
,
the
Senate
liberals
rounded
up
their
slim
majority
and
prepared
to
choke
off
debate
on
the
filibuster
battle
this
week
.

last
act

Since
Election
Day
,
Vice
President
Richard
Nixon
had
virtually
retired
--
by
his
own
wish
--
from
public
view
.

But
with
the
convening
of
the
new
Congress
,
he
was
the
public
man
again
,
presiding
over
the
Senate
until
John
Kennedy's
Inauguration
.

Nixon
fulfilled
his
assignment
with
grace
,
then
went
beyond
the
required
``
sufficient
declaration
''
.

``
This
is
the
first
time
in
100
years
that
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
announced
the
result
of
an
election
in
which
he
was
defeated
''
,
he
said
.

The
Masters
golf
tournament
proved
last
Monday
what
it
can
do
to
the
strongest
men
and
the
staunchest
nerves
.

Gary
Player
,
the
small
,
trim
South
African
,
was
the
eventual
winner
,
but
in
all
his
25
years
he
never
spent
a
more
harrowing
afternoon
as
he
waited
for
the
victory
to
drop
in
his
lap
.

Arnold
Palmer
,
the
defending
champion
,
lost
his
title
on
the
72nd
hole
after
a
few
minutes
of
misfortune
that
left
even
his
fellow
pros
gaping
in
disbelief
.

``
Just
when
you
think
you
have
it
licked
,
this
golf
course
can
get
up
and
bite
you
''
,
Player
had
said
one
afternoon
midway
through
the
tournament
.

After
playing
a
splendid
first
nine
holes
in
34
--
two
strokes
under
par
--
on
this
fifth
and
final
day
of
the
tournament
(
Sunday's
fourth
round
had
been
washed
out
by
a
violent
rainstorm
when
it
was
only
half
completed
)
,
Player's
game
rapidly
fell
to
pieces
.

Palmer
had
started
the
round
four
strokes
behind
Player
,
and
at
one
point
in
the
afternoon
had
trailed
by
as
many
as
six
strokes
.

When
Palmer
hit
a
good
straight
drive
up
the
fairway
on
the
72nd
hole
,
he
seemed
to
have
the
championship
won
.

He
did
seem
hasty
on
his
second
and
third
shots
,
but
then
there
was
an
agonizing
wait
of
several
minutes
while
Coe
graciously
putted
out
,
giving
Palmer
a
chance
to
recover
his
composure
,
which
he
had
quite
visibly
lost
.

Palmer
was
now
putting
merely
for
a
tie
,
and
Player
,
who
was
sitting
beside
his
wife
and
watching
it
all
on
television
in
Tournament
Chairman
Clifford
Roberts'
clubhouse
apartment
,
stared
in
amazement
when
Palmer
missed
the
putt
.

Player
won
only
one
.

On
the
final
round
at
Pensacola
,
the
luck
of
the
draw
paired
Palmer
and
Player
in
the
same
threesome
and
,
although
it
was
far
from
obvious
at
the
time
,
the
gallery
was
treated
to
the
first
chapter
of
what
promises
to
be
one
of
the
most
exciting
duels
in
sport
for
a
long
time
to
come
.

On
that
final
Sunday
at
Pensacola
neither
Palmer
nor
Player
was
leading
the

and
,
as
it
turned
out
,
neither
won
it

Thereafter
,
until
the
Masters
,
Player
gradually
increased
his
lead
over
Palmer
in
winnings
and
added
one
more
tournament
victory
at

The
boldness
of
champions

Anyone
who
now
doubted
that
a
personal
duel
was
under
way
had
only
to
watch
how
these
exceptionally
gifted
golfers
were
playing
this
most
difficult
golf
course
.

And
last
week
at
the
Masters
Palmer
and
Player
did
.

Player
immediately
proceeded
to
follow
suit
.

The
latter
involved
hitting
a
full
four-wood
out
to
the
first
fairway
and
toward
the
clubhouse
,
hoping
to
slice
it
back
to
the
deeply
bunkered
9th
green
.

Player
attacked
with
his
four-wood
and
hit
a
shot
that
few
who
saw
it
will
ever
forget
.

At
the
4th
tee
Palmer
chose
to
hit
a
one-iron
when
a
three-wood
was
the
proper
club
,
so
he
put
the
ball
in
a
bunker
in
front
of
the
green
.

But
when

Albert
Gregory
Pearson
of
the
Los
Angeles
Angels

who
once
caught
three
straight
fly
balls
in
center
field
because
,
as
a
teammate
explained
,
``
the
other
team
thought
no
one
was
out
there
''
,
hits
seven
home
runs
in
four
months
(
three
more
than
his
total
in
1958
,
1959
,
and
1960
)
,
his
achievement
borders
on
the
ridiculous
.

This
is
the
year
home
runs
ranged
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
.

(

)
Willie
Mays
of
the
San
Francisco
Giants
borrowed
a
teammate's
bat
and
became
the
ninth
big
leaguer
to
stroke
four
home
runs
in
a
game
;
;

After
108
games
in
1927
,
Ruth
had
35
home
runs
.

After
108
games
in
1961
,
Mickey
Mantle
has
43
,
Roger
Maris
41
.

But
one
thing
is
for
certain
:
There
is
no
dissension
between
Mantle
,
the
American
League's
Most
Valuable
Player
in
1956
and
1957
,
and
Maris
,
the
MVP
in
1960
.

Each
enjoys
seeing
the
other
hit
home
runs
(
``
I
hope
Roger
hits
80
''
,
Mantle
says
)
,
and
each
enjoys
even
more
seeing
himself
hit
home
runs
(
``
and
I
hope
I
hit
81
''
)
.

The
sluggers
get
along
so
well
in
fact
,
that
with
their
families
at
home
for
the
summer
(
Mantle's
in
Dallas
,
Maris's
in
Kansas
City
)
,
they
are
rooming
together
.

``
What
do
you
and
Mickey
talk
about
at
home
''
?
?

A
reporter
asked
Maris
recently
.

He
told
me
he
vowed
right
then
that
if
he
ever
got
to
be
a
star
,
this
never
would
be
said
of
him
''
.

Mantle
has
kept
the
vow
.

Among
all
the
Yankees
,
he
is
the
veteran
most
friendly
to
rookies
.

Mantle
,
beyond
any
question
,
can
do
more
things
well
.

Both
are
good
,
daring
fielders
:
Mantle
covers
more
ground
;
;

With
this
ultimate
weapon
,
the
two
Yankees
may
have
saved
baseball
from
its
dullest
season

Valedictorian
Holmes

Holmes
was

had

,
or
a
``
beatnik
parlor
or

''
.

No

still
called
him
``

Last
week
Chicago
happily
found
its
top
scholar
in
Caltech's
acting
dean
of
the
faculty
:
dynamic
Geneticist
George
Wells
Beadle
,
57
,
who
shared
the
1958
Nobel
Prize
in
medicine
and
physiology
for
discovering
how
genes
affect
heredity
by
controlling
cell
chemistry
(

.

At
Caltech
,
Geneticist
Beadle
has
stuck
close
to
his
research
as
head
of
the
school's
famous
biology
division
since
1946
.

This
is
an
area
nearly
as
large
as
Western
Europe
;
;

and
it
was
filled
then
as
now
by
quarreling
tribes
with
no
political
or
historical
unity
.

The
population
of
the
Congo
is
13.5
million
,
divided
into
at
least
seven
major
``
culture
clusters
''
and
innumerable
tribes
speaking
400
separate
dialects
.

At
first
the
Belgian
royal
family
administered
the
Congo
as
its
own
private
property
.

The
honor
of
the
Belgians
in
this
matter
is
not
to
be
questioned
--
only
their
judgment
.

In
Inside
Africa
,
John
Gunther
describes
one
of
these
,
the
Societe
Generale
,
as
``
the
kind
of
colossus
that
might
be
envisaged
if
,
let
us
say
,
the
House
of
Morgan
,
Anaconda
Copper
,
the
Mutual
Life
Insurance
Company
of
New
York
,
the
Pennsylvania
Railroad
,
and
various
companies
producing
agricultural
products
were
lumped
together
,
with
the
United
States
government
as
a
heavy
partner
''
.

During
the
1950s
there
were
as
many
as
25,000
schools
in
the
Congo
.

But
almost
all
the
schools
were
primary
.

The
average
Congolese
can
do
little
more
than
puzzle
out
the
meaning
of
``
la
chatte
''
and
``
le
chien
''
and
write
his
name
.

and
in
Brussels
,
street
crowds
shouted
,
``
Pas
une
goutte
de
sang
!
!

It
is
hard
to
blame
them
for
this
.

Third
,
there
were
those
(
notably
Patrice
Lumumba
)
who
favored
a
unified
Congo
with
a
very
strong
central
government
.

On
July
14
the
Security
Council
--
with
France
and
Great
Britain
abstaining
--
voted
the
resolution
which
drew
the
U.N.
into
the
Congo
.

The
Belgians
were
reluctant
to
withdraw
their
troops
and
often
obstructed
U.N.
efforts
.

)
Lumumba
further
complicated
the
U.N.'s
mission
by
initiating
small
``
wars
''
with
the
secessionist
province
of
Katanga
and
with
South
Kasai
which
,
under
Albert
Kalonji
,
wanted
to
secede
as
well
.

But
by
the
end
of
the
three-month
period
,
in
October
1960
,
something
approaching
calm
settled
on
the
Congo
.

ordered
an
investigation
of
Lumumba's
death
;
;

The
conversation
apparently
convinced
Mr.
Kennedy
that
the
positions
of
France
and
Tunisia
were
not
irreconcilable
.

and
one
U.S.
official
said
:
``
The
key
question
now
is
which
side
picks
up
the
phone
first
''
.

In
conferences
with
Nationalist
China's
dapper
,
diminutive
Vice
President
Chen
Cheng
,
Mr.
Kennedy
assured
Chiang
Kai-shek's
emissary
that
the
U.S.
is
as
firmly
opposed
as
ever
to
the
admission
of
Red
China
to
the
United
Nations
.

Salvador
saw
the
youth
hold
his

the
head

Lois
Carnegey

But
last
week's
pirates
,
like
the
Cuban-American
who
recently
hijacked
an
Eastern
Airlines
Electra
(
Newsweek
,
Aug.
7
)
,
wanted
to
go
to
Havana
.

But
,
he
told
the
``
skyjackers
''
,
the
707
didn't
carry
enough
fuel
to
reach
Havana
;
;

thought
he
was

Air
Force
recruiter

What
the

wanted
was
four
persons
to
volunteer
as
hostages
,
along
with
the
crew
.

Mullen
from
Mercer
Island
,
Wash.

;

Fla.
,
and
Leonard
Gilman
,
a
former
college
boxer
and
veteran
of
the
U.S.
Immigration
Service
Border
Patrol
.

they
had
orders
to
that
effect
straight
from
President
Kennedy
,
who
thought
at
first
,
as
did
most
others
,
that
it
was
four
followers
of
Cuba's
Fidel
Castro
who
had
taken
over
the
707
.

Tension

the
plane
slowed
to
a
halt
.

Ambulances
,
baggage
trucks
,
and
cars
surrounded
it
.

The
day
wore
on
.

So
did
hostages
Casey
,
Cleveland
,
and
Mullen
.

Gilman
started
talking
to
him
until
he
saw
his
chance
.

He
caught
officer
Simmons'
eye
,
nodded
toward
young
Bearden
,
and
--
``
I
swung
my
right
as
hard
as
I
could
.

With
the
money
all
but
in
hand
,
however
,
the
Administration
indicated
that
,
instead
of
the
225,000
more
men
in
uniform
that
President
Kennedy
had
requested
,
the
armed
forces
would
be
increased
by
only
160,000
.

)
The
House
,
which
had
passed
its
smaller
appropriation
before
the
President's
urgent
call
for
more
,
was
expected
to
go
along
with
the
increased
defense
budget
in
short
order
.

The
Senate
also
voted
$5.2
billion
to
finance
the
government's
health
,
welfare
,
and
labor
activities
.

Most
members
of
the
U.S.
Senate
,
because
they
are
human
,
like
to
eat
as
high
on
the
hog
as
they
can
.

But
,
because
they
are
politicians
,
they
like
to
talk
as
poor-mouth
as
the
lowliest
voter
.

As
a
result
,
ever
since
1851
when
the
Senate
restaurant
opened
in
the
new
wing
of
the
Capitol
Building
,
the
senators
have
never
ceased
to
grumble
about
the
food
--
even
while
they
opposed
every
move
that
might
improve
it
.

Long-term
trend
of
traffic
on
these
roads
seems
clearly
upward
.

Result
is
a
better
prospect
for
a
full
payoff
by
bonds
that
once
were
regarded
as
highly
speculative
.

However
,
in
the
same
three-month
period
,
toll-road
bonds
,
as
a
group
,
have
bucked
this
trend
.

On
these
bonds
,
price
rises
since
February
21
easily
outnumber
price
declines
.

Many
of
the
toll-road
bonds
still
are
selling
at
prices
that
offer
the
prospect
of
an
annual
yield
of
4
per
cent
,
or
very
close
to
that
.

It's
not
much
more
,
in
fact
,
than
the
return
that
is
offered
on
U.
S.
Treasury
bonds
.

The
report
is
based
on
a
survey
by
Blyth
&
Company
,
investment
bankers
.

Then
March
brought
an
18
per
cent
rise
in
net
revenues
--
after
operating
costs
.

For
the
year
,
the
road
earned
133
per
cent
of
its
interest
costs
,
against
121
per
cent
in
the
preceding
period
.

Slow
successes
.

The
187-mile
Illinois
State
Toll
Highway
,
for
example
,
was
not
opened
over
its
entire
length
until
December
,
1958
.

Success
,
for
many
turnpikes
,
has
come
hard
.

Traffic
frequently
has
failed
to
measure
up
to
engineers'
rosy
estimates
.

In
these
cases
,
the
turnpike
managements
have
had
to
turn
to
toll-rate
increases
,
or
to
costly
improvements
such
as
extensions
or
better
connections
with
other
highways
.

Higher
tolls
are
planned
for
July
1
,
1961
,
on
the
Richmond-Petersburg
,
Va.
,
Turnpike
,
and
proposals
for
increased
tolls
on
the
Texas
Turnpike
are
under
study
.

Net
earnings
of
that
road
rose
from
62
per
cent
of
interest
requirements
in
calendar
1957
to
86
per
cent
in
the
12
months
ended
Feb.
28
,
1961
.

Already
,
however
,
several
of
the
turnpikes
are
earning
enough
to
cover
interest
requirements
by
comfortable
margins
.

Commerce
Secretary
Luther
Hodges
,
accompanied
by
a
member
of
our
staff
,
on
May
10
toured
plants
of
two
of
Italy's
biggest
companies
--
Fiat
,
the
auto
producer
,
and
Olivetti
,
maker
of
typewriters
and
calculating
machines
.

``
Follow
Secretary
Hodges
through
the
Fiat
plant
,
and
you
learn
this
:

A
skilled
worker
on
the
assembly
line
,
for
example
,
earns
$37
a
week
.

Fiat
officials
say
they
have
had
no
strikes
for
more
than
six
years
.

Within
a
year
,
without
reducing
wages
,
Underwood's
production
costs
were
cut
one
third
,
prices
were
slashed
.

``
The
Olivetti
plant
near
Turin
has
modern
layout
,
modern
machinery
.

The
U.S.
will
try
to
get
agreement
among
the
industrialized
countries
to
take
more
textile
imports
from
the
less-developed
countries
over
the
years
.

Idea
is
to
let
these
countries
earn
their
way
as
much
as
possible
.

At
the
same
time
,
another
purpose
of
the
conference
will
be
to
get
certain
low-wage
countries
to
control
textile
exports
--
especially
dumping
of
specific
products
--
to
high-wage
textile-producing
countries
.

Hong
Kong
interests
loudly
protest
limiting
their
exports
to
Britain
,
while
Spanish
and
Portuguese
textiles
pour
into
British
market
unrestrictedly
.

The
Kennedy
hope
is
that
,
at
the
conference
or
through
bilateral
talks
,
the
low-wage
textile-producing
countries
in
Asia
and
Europe
will
see
that
``
dumping
''
practices
cause
friction
all
around
and
may
result
in
import
quotas
.

Gradual
,
controlled
expansion
of
the
world's
textile
trade
is
what
President
Kennedy
wants
.

Note
,
too
,
that
the
Kennedy
textile
plan
looks
toward
modernization
or
shrinkage
of
the
U.S.
textile
industry
.

Special
depreciation
on
new
textile
machinery
may
be
allowed
.

Yet
U.S.
coal
is
cheap
enough
to
make
foreign
steelmakers'
mouths
water
.

Virginia
coal
,
delivered
by
ship
in
Wales
,
will
be
about
$2.80
a
ton
cheaper
than
Welsh
coal
delivered
by
rail
from
nearby
mines
.

Many
of
the
coal
seams
in
the
nationalized
British
mines
are
twisting
,
narrow
and
very
deep
.

Welsh
coal
miners
,
Communist-led
,
are
up
in
arms
at
the
suggestion
that
the
steel
company
bring
in
American
coal
.

The
plight
of
a
small
community
library
is
proportionately
worse
.

New
York
State
has
what
is
probably
the
most
advanced
of
these
co-operative
systems
,
so
well
developed
that
it
has
become
a
model
for
others
to
follow
.

Because
it
is
so
large
a
state
,
with
marked
contrasts
in
population
density
,
the
organization
of
the
New
York
co-operative
offers
a
cross-section
of
how
the
plan
works
.

At
one
extreme
are
the
systems
of
upper
New
York
State
,
where
libraries
in
two
or
more
counties
combine
to
serve
a
large
,
sparsely
populated
area
.

At
the
other
are
organizations
like
the
newly
formed
Nassau
Library
System
,
in
a
high-density
area
,
with
ample
resources
and
a
rapidly
growing
territory
to
serve
.

Within
a
system
,
however
,
the
autonomy
of
each
member
library
is
preserved
.

All
services
are
given
without
cost
to
members
.

The
basic
state
grant
is
thirty
cents
for
each
person
served
,
and
there
is
a
further
book
incentive
grant
that
provides
an
extra
twenty
cents
up
to
fifty
cents
per

library
spends

This
system
,
by
virtue
of
its
variety
and
size
,
offers
an
inclusive
view
of
the
plan
in
operation
.

On
microfilm
,
headquarters
also
has
a
file
of
the
New
York
Times
from
its
founding
in
1851
to
the
present
day
,
as
well
as
bound
volumes
of
important
periodicals
.

It
is
connected
by
teletype
with
the
State
Library
in
Albany
,
which
will
supply
any
book
to
a
system
that
the
system
itself
cannot
provide
.

while
Hewlett-Woodmere
is
the
repository
of

,

,
and
foreign
languages
.

Public
libraries
in
Nassau
County
have
been
lending
books
to
each
other
by
mail
for
a
quarter-century
,
but
the
system
enables
this
process
to
operate
on
an
organized
and
far
more
comprehensive
basis
.

Schools
and
community
groups
turn
to
the
headquarters
film
library
for
documentary
,
art
,
and
experimental
films
to
show
at
libraries
that
sponsor
local
programs
,
and
to
organizations
in
member
communities
.

In
addition
to
the
interlibrary
loan
service
and
the
children's
program
,
headquarters
has
a
public
relations
director
who
seeks
to
get
wider
grassroots
support
for
quality
library
service
in
the
county
;
;

it
prepares
cooperative
displays
(
posters
,
booklists
,
brochures
,
and
other
promotional
material
)
for
use
in
member
libraries
;
;

and
it
publishes
Sum
And
Substance
,
a
monthly
newsletter
,
which
reports
the
system's
activities
to
the
staffs
and
trustees
of
member
libraries
.

In
Nassau
,
as
in
other
systems
,
the
long-range
objective
is
to
bring
the
maximum
service
of
libraries
to
bear
on
the
schools
,
and
on
adult
education
in
general
.

A
fundamental
source
of
knowledge
in
the
world
today
is
the
book
found
in
our
libraries
.

There
are
,
for
example
,
approximately
25,000,000
people
in
this
country
with
no
public
library
service
and
about
50,000,000
with
inadequate
service
.

This
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
National
Library
Week
,
April
16-22
,
and
for
its
theme
:
``
For
a
richer
,
fuller
life
,
read
''
!
!

In
all
the
turmoil
,
some
good
legislation
was
passed
.

Certainly
all
can
applaud
passage
of
an
auto
title
law
,
the
school
bills
,
the
increase
in
teacher
pensions
,
the
ban
on
drag
racing
,
acceptance
by
the
state
of
responsibility
for
maintenance
of
state
roads
in
municipalities
at
the
same
rate
as
outside
city
limits
,
repeal
of
the
college
age
limit
law
and
the
road
maintenance
bond
issue
.

Only
a
token
start
was
made
in
attacking
the
tax
reappraisal
question
and
its
companion
issue
of
attracting
industry
to
the
state
.

We
congratulate
the
entire
membership
on
its
record
of
good
legislation
.

Coupling
its
own
budget
of
$83,750
with
a
$30,000
state
grant
authorized
by
Gov.
Vandiver
,
the
group
expects
to
sign
a
contract
in
March
with
Georgia
Tech.
.

The
danger
lay
in
the
American
delusion
that
nuclear
deterrence
was
enough
.

DeKalb
budget
shows
county
is
on
beam

That
such
expansion
can
be
obtained
without
a
raise
in
taxes
is
due
to
growth
of
the
tax
digest
and
sound
fiscal
planning
on
the
part
of
the
board
of
commissioners
,
headed
by
Chairman
Charles
O.
Emmerich
who
is
demonstrating
that
the
public
trust
he
was
given
was
well
placed
,
and
other
county
officials
.

Somewhere

The
firm
does
a
large
amount
of
research
and
its
forecasts
have
meaning
.

Actually
it
amounts
to
$1,250,000
above
what
the
institution
already
is
receiving
,
considering
the
additional
half-million
dollars
Gov.
Vandiver
allocated
last
year
from
the
state
surplus
.

The
practice
of
charging
employes
for
meals
whether
they
eat
at
the
hospital
or
not
should
be
abolished
.

The
work
week
of
attendants
who
are
on
duty
65
hours
and
more
per
week
should
be
reduced
.

Even
with
the
increase
in
funds
for
the
next
fiscal
year
,
Georgia
will
be
spending
only
around
$3.15
per
day
per
patient
.

Georgia
has
made
some
reforms
,
true
.

Considering
what
is
being
done
compared
to
what
needs
to
be
done
,
it
behooves
the
hospital
management
to
do
some
mighty
careful
planning
toward
making
the
best
possible
use
of
the
increase
granted
.

Trujillo's
dictatorship
had
been
along
conservative
,
right-wing
lines
.

For
that
reason
any
democratic
reform
and
effort
to
bring
genuine
representative
government
to
the
Dominican
Republic
will
need
the
greatest
sympathy
and
help
.

Must
Berlin
remain
divided
?
?

It
was
not
a
part
of
any
one
of
the
three
(
later
four
)
zones
for
occupation
by
Soviet
,
American
,
British
,
and
French
troops
respectively
.

Then
they
moved
offices
of
the
East
German
puppet
government
into
East
Berlin
and
began
illegally
to
treat
it
as
the
capital
of
East
Germany
.

The
British
and
other
replies
to
that
Moscow
note
pointed
out
efforts
of
the
Communist
authorities
``
to
integrate
East
Berlin
into
East
Germany
by
isolating
it
from
the
outside
and
attempting
to
make
it
the
capital
of
East
Germany
''
.

This
is
far
from
acknowledging
or
recognizing
those
efforts
as
an
accomplished
fact
.

Thousands

brown
throw-rug
upon
the
rolling
,
dusty-green

.

The
National
Park
Service
now
proposes
to
preserve
an
area
in
Pottawatomie
County
,
northeast
Kansas
,
as
a
``
Prairie
National
Park
''
.

Even
the
Distilled
Spirits
Institute
has
long
had
a
specific
prohibition
.

Simply
because
the
subverting
action
of
firms
that
are
not
members
of
the
Distilled
Spirits
Institute
and
of
radio
and
TV
stations
that
are
not
members
of
the
NAB
tends
to
spread
.

While
all
citizens
share
in
blame
for
lax
municipal
ethics
the
Wagner
regime
has
seen
serious
problems
in
the
schools
,
law
enforcement
and
fiscal
policies
.

Mayor
Wagner's
shortcomings
have
perhaps
been
more
mercilessly
exposed
than
those
of
Mr.
Levitt
who
left
an
impression
of
quiet
competence
in
his
more
protected
state
post
.

Little
war
,
big
test

Both
Mr.
K's
have
so
far
continued
to
speak
softly
and
carry
big
sticks
over
Laos
.

He
must
show
at
the
outset
that
he
means
exactly
what
he
says
.

But
for
the
United
States
and
its
SEATO
allies
to
attempt
to
shore
up
a
less
tough
,
less
combat-tested
government
army
in
monsoon-shrouded
,
road-shy
,
guerrilla-th'-wisp
terrain
is
a
risk
not
savored
by
Pentagon
planners
.

The
State
Department
tacitly
rejected
the
neutral
Laos
idea
after
the
Geneva
conference
of
1954
,
and
last
year
Washington
backed
the
rightist
coup
that
ousted
neutral
Premier
Souvanna
Phouma
.

But
since
last
fall
the
United
States
has
been
moving
toward
a
pro-neutralist
position
and
now
is
ready
to
back
the
British
plan
for
a
cease-fire
patrolled
by
outside
observers
and
followed
by
a
conference
of
interested
powers
.

The
road
to
a
guaranteed-neutral
,
coup-proof
Laos
is
today
almost
as
difficult
as
warfare
on
that
nation's
terrain
.

But
for
the
safety
of
Southeast
Asia
,
and
for
the
sake
of
the
Laotian
people
--
who
would
not
be
well-ruled
by
either
militant
minority
now
engaged
in
the
fighting
--
this
last
big
effort
to
seal
that
country
from
the
cold
war
had
to
be
made
.

This
year's
Senate
measure
would
provide
each
state
and
the
District
of
Columbia
with
$1,000,000
to
be
used
in
support
of
private
,
state
,
or
municipal
ETV
efforts
.

Mr.
Rayburn
was
not
an
easy
man
to
classify
or
to
label
.

It
might
be
added
that
as
he
kept
his
word
so
he
expected
that
others
keep
theirs
.

When
it
was
not
,
one
of
the
great
dramas
of
Washington
would
be
presented
.

He
would
rise
in
the
well
of
the
House
,
his
chin
upon
his
chest
,
his
hands
gripping
the
side
of
a
desk
,
and
the
political
and
legislative
chatter
would
subside
into
silence
.

To
almost
two
generations
of
Americans
it
must
have
seemed
as
though
the
existence
of
Mr.
Sam
coincided
with
that
of
the
House
.

And
it
was
the
House
he
loved
.

Sound
the
roll
of
those
with
whom
he
served
and
who
preceded
him
in
death
.

He
was
a
fighter
for
those
of
his
own
party
.

As
it
was
,
his
absence
because
of
his
final
illness
was
a
blow
to
the
administration
.

Right
now
,
they
are
pushing
a
resolution
which
would
have
UN
use
its
forces
to
invade
and
subjugate
Katanga
.

The
Congo
should
have
been
mandated
,
because
it
was
not
ready
for
independence
.

Otherwise
,
UN
will
march
blindly
on
to
certain
defeat
.

Another
evidence
of
the
spreading
rule
of
reason
was
provided
from
Mexico
City
with
the
daily
hijacking
of
an
American
plane
by
a
demented
Algerian
with
a
gun
.

As
head
of
the
United
Nations
he
was
the
symbol
of
world
peace
,
and
his
tragic
end
came
at
a
moment
when
peace
hangs
precariously
.

The
story
of
the
fatal
crash
is
not
fully
known
.

The
U.N.-chartered
plane
which
was
flying
from
the
conference
city
of
Ndola
in
Northern
Rhodesia
had
been
riddled
with
machinegun
bullets
last
weekend
and
was
newly
repaired
.

He
was
controversial
because
he
was
uncompromising
for
peace
and
freedom
with
justice
.

His
policies
had
resolved
the
conflicts
that
threatened
to
ignite
the
cold
war
and
workable
solutions
were
beginning
to
take
shape
.

If
the
manner
of
his
passing
moves
the
nations
to
act
in
the
spirit
of
his
dedication
the
sore
issues
that
plague
the
world
can
yet
be
resolved
with
reason
and
justice
.

Too
many
have
bogged
down
in
bickering
.

They
allotted
$500,000
three
years
ago
to
support
Interama
until
its
own
financing
could
be
arranged
.

So
have
the
people's
elected
spokesmen
at
the
state
and
federal
levels
.

progress
,
or
lack
of
it
,
toward
civil
rights
in
the
50
states
is
reported
in
an
impressive
689-page
compilation
issued
last
week
by
the
United
States
Commission
on
Civil
Rights
.

``
The
committee
continues
to
feel
that
Florida
has
progressed
in
a
sound
and
equitable
program
at
both
the
state
and
local
levels
in
its
efforts
to
review
and
assess
transition
problems
as
they
arise
from
time
to
time
in
the
entire
spectrum
of
civil
rights
''
.

Problems
have
arisen
in
this
sensitive
field
but
have
been
handled
in
most
cases
with
understanding
and
restraint
.

West
Germany
will
face
the
crucial
tests
that
lie
ahead
,
on
Berlin
and
unification
,
with
a
coalition
government
.

This
is
the
key
fact
emerging
from
Sunday's
national
election
.

Chancellor
Adenauer's
Christian
Democratic
Party
slipped
only
a
little
in
the
voting
but
it
was
enough
to
lose
the
absolute
Bundestag
majority
it
has
enjoyed
since
1957
.

He
is
dedicated
to
building
the
nation's
strength
and
,
as
are
all
West
Germans
,
to
a
free
Berlin
and
to
reunion
with
captive
East
Germany
.

What
is
in
doubt
as
the
free
Germans
and
their
allies
consider
the
voting
trends
is
the
nature
of
the
coalition
that
will
result
.

If
the
party
of
Adenauer
and
Erhart
,
with
45
per
cent
of
the
vote
,
approaches
the
party
of
Willy
Brandt
,
which
won
36
per
cent
,
the
result
would
be
a
stiffening
of
the
old
resolve
.

The
question
left
by
the
election
is
whether
West
Germany
veers
slightly
toward
more
firmness
or
more
flexibility
.

And
the
career
of
Konrad
Adenauer
,
who
upheld
Germany's
tradition
of
rock-like
leaders
which
Bismarck
began
,
draws
near
the
end
.

Does
it
attempt
to
rewrite
modern
history
by
blaming
American
statesmen
for
wars
,
Communism
,
depression
,
and
other
troubles
of
the
world
?
?

In
some
instances
a
seventh
question
can
be
added
:
7
.

Does
the
organization
show
an
affinity
for
a
foreign
government
,
political
party
or
personality
in
opposition
or
preference
to
the
American
system
?
?

Falling
somewhere
in
a
category
between
Einstein's
theory
and
sand
fleas
--
difficult
to
see
but
undeniably
there
,
nevertheless
--
is
the
tropical
green
``
city
''
of
Islandia
,
a
string
of
offshore
islands
that
has
almost
no
residents
,
limited
access
and
an
unlimited
future
.

In
this
instance
,
happily
,
insistence
is
being
made
that
our
share
is
protected
.

And
until
this
protection
is
at
least
as
concrete
as
,
say
,
the
row
of
hotels
that
bars
us
from
our
own
sands
at
Miami
Beach
,
those
who
represent
us
all
should
agree
to
nothing
.

In
the
preamble
to
the
open-meeting
statutes
,
collectively
known
as
the
Brown
Act
,
the
Legislature
declares
that
``
the
public
commissions
,
boards
and
councils
and
other
public
agencies
in
this
state
exist
to
aid
in
the
conduct
of
the
people's
business
.

Since
1953
California
has
led
the
nation
in
enacting
guarantees
that
public
business
shall
be
publicly
conducted
,
but
not
until
this
year
did
the
lawmakers
in
Sacramento
plug
the
remaining
loopholes
in
the
Brown
Act
.

Despite
the
lip
service
paid
by
local
governments
,
the
anti-secrecy
statutes
have
been
continuously
subverted
by
reservations
and
rationalizations
.

We
submit
that
this
is
a
most
desirable
effect
of
the
law
--
and
one
of
its
principal
aims
.

But
the
citizens
would
,
of
course
,
never
be
sure
that
the
decisions
that
resulted
were
as
correct
as
they
were
expeditious
.

Help
when
needed

those
watching
the
growing
rivalry
between
craft
unions
and
industrial
unions
may
recognize
all
the
pressures
that
led
to
the
big
labor
split
in
1935
.

Craft
unions
seek
work
that
industrial
unions
claim
,
such
as
factory
maintenance
.

The
issue
was
sufficiently
potent
in
1935
to
spark
secession
from
the
American
Federation
of
Labor
of
its
industrial
union
members
.

Walter
Reuther
,
leader
of
the
industrial
union
faction
of
the
AFL-CIO
,
says
another
two
years
of
this
squabbling
will
be
disastrous
for
all
American
labor
.

The
1961
feed
grain
program
,
which
the
secretary
sponsored
,
has
been
declared
a
billion
dollar
fiasco
.

In
exchange
for
higher
price
supports
,
growers
pledged
reduction
in
planted
acreage
.

Perhaps
,
as
Mr.
Freeman
says
,
American
agriculture
may
stop
the
Communists
,
but
it
is
also
swindling
the
American
taxpayer
.

The
department
needs
a
clearer
``
sense
of
direction
''
at
the
top
and
it
needs
fewer
,
but
better
,
people
,
Sen.
Jackson
says
.

The
subcommittee
is
not
alone
in
questioning
the
effectiveness
of
the
department
.

Nor
does
Sen.
Jackson
discuss
the
delicate
situation
created
by
the
presence
in
the
White
House
of
a
corps
of
presidential
assistants
engaged
in
the
study
of
foreign
policy
.

Mr.
Mitchell
had
an
excuse
for
losing
--
the
steel
strike
lasted
much
longer
than
he
anticipated
.

The
secretary
based
his
assessment
on
the
upturn
in
retail
sales
.

Corroborating
Mr.
Hodges'
figures
was
the
Federal
Reserve
Board's
report
of
the
large
sales
increase
in
the
nation's
department
stores
for
the
week
ending
March
4
.

Another
optimistic
sign
,
this
one
from
the
Labor
Department
,
was
the
report
that
the
long
rise
in
unemployment
compensation
payments
``
was
interrupted
for
the
first
time
in
the
week
ending
Feb.
25
''

need
not
be
told
of
the
builder's
march
to
the
sea
,
for
in
a
single
generation
he
has
parceled
and
populated
miles
of
our
shoreline
and
presses
on
to
develop
the
few
open
spaces
that
remain
.

The
move
for
establishment
of
a
national
seashore
park
on
30,000
acres
of
Cape
Cod
,
from
Provincetown
to
Chatham
,
is
strengthened
by
President
Kennedy's
interest
in
that
area
.

By
comparison
,
Stone
Harbor
bird
sanctuary's
allies
seem
less
formidable
,
for
aside
from
the
Audubon
Society
,
they
are
mostly
the
snowy
,
common
and
cattle
egrets
and
the
Louisiana
,
green
,
little
blue
and
black-crowned
herons
who
nest
and
feed
there
.

The
desirability
of
preserving
such
places
as
the
Cape
dunes
and
Stone
Harbor
sanctuary
becomes
more
apparent
every
year
.

Public
sentiment
for
conserving
our
rich
natural
heritage
is
growing
.

No
joyride

Anybody
who
is
expecting
a
joyride
should
,
according
to
Mr.
Shriver
,
get
off
the
train
right
now
.

First
of
all
,
the
recruits
will
have
to
undergo
arduous
schooling
.

The
city
has
a
stake
in
stimulating
growth
and
purchasing
power
throughout
outstate
Missouri
and
Southern
Illinois
.

The
research
center
of
the
University's
School
of
Business
and
Public
Administration
is
prepared
to
undertake
the
analysis
Dr.
Ellis
has
been
talking
about
.

In
Southern
Illinois
,
the
new
federal
program
of
help
to
economically
depressed
areas
ought
to
provide
some
stimulus
to
growth
.

More
industrial
acreage
lies
vacant
in
St.
Clair
county
than
in
any
other
jurisdiction
in
the
St.
Louis
area
.

Still
we
must
confess
that
sometimes
some
of
them
go
too
far
.

Granted
that
the
Tammany
name
and
the
Tammany
tiger
often
were
regarded
as
badges
of
political
shame
,
the
sachems
of
the
Hall
also
have
a
few
good
marks
to
their
credit
.

After
all
,
it
goes
back
to
the
days
in
which
sedition
was
not
un-American
,
the
days
in
which
the
Sons
of
St.
Tammany
conspired
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence
--
the
British
government
,
that
is
.

And
while
he
had
headed
Batista's
anti-Communist
section
,
the
Batista
regime
did
not
disturb
the
Communists
so
much
as
more
open
opponents
who
were
alleged
to
be
Communists
.

Responsibility
for
the
Faget
appointment
rests
with
Gen.
J.
M.
Swing
,
an
Eisenhower
appointee
as
head
of
the
Immigration
Service
.

The
former
President
blithely
ignored
recent
history
in
speaking
of
``
dollarette
''
dollars
under
Kennedy
Administration
fiscal
policies
.

This
is
a
matter
of
respect
for
the
Presidency
.

Gen.
Taylor
will
report
to
President
Kennedy
in
a
few
days
on
the
results
of
his
visit
to
South
Viet
Nam
and
,
judging
from
some
of
his
remarks
to
reporters
in
the
Far
East
,
he
is
likely
to
urge
a
more
efficient
mobilization
of
Vietnamese
military
,
economic
,
political
and
other
resources
.

Communist
guerrillas
recently
have
been
reported
increasing
their
activities
and
the
great
flood
of
the
Mekong
River
has
interposed
a
new
crisis
.

The
U.N.'s
'
gravest
crisis
'

The
Secretary
General
must
have
,
subject
to
the
constitutional
direction
of
the
Security
Council
and
the
General
Assembly
,
the
power
to
act
,
to
propose
action
and
to
organize
action
without
being
hobbled
by
advisers
and
assistants
acting
on
someone
else's
instructions
.

The
board
will
be
able
to
increase
,
decrease
,
add
or
eliminate
budget
items
,
subject
to
the
Mayor's
veto
;
;

The
Controller
retains
his
essential
``
fiscal
watchdog
''
functions
;
;

Some
fiscal
changes
are
important
.

This
will
have
a
beneficial
effect
by
expediting
public
business
;
;

Enlargement
of
the
City
Council
and
a
new
method
of
selecting
members
will
be
discussed
tomorrow
.

Freedom
of
the
press
was
lost
in
Cuba
because
of
decades
of
corruption
and
social
imbalances
.

He
felt
able
to
end
on
a
note
of
hope
.

He
sees
evidence
of
fair
winds
for
the
ten-year
Alliance
for
Progress
plan
with
its
emphasis
on
social
reforms
.

The
evident
contradiction
between
the
rosy
picture
of
Russia's
progress
painted
by
the
Communist
party's
program
and
the
enormous
dangers
for
all
humanity
posed
by
Premier
Khrushchev's
Berlin
policy
has
already
led
to
speculation
abroad
that
the
program
may
be
severely
altered
.

Whether
it
is
or
not
,
the
propaganda
impact
on
the
free
world
of
the
document
scheduled
to
be
adopted
at
this
meeting
will
be
far
less
than
had
been
originally
anticipated
.

And
there
must
be
many
Soviet
citizens
who
know
what
is
going
on
and
who
realize
that
before
they
can
hope
to
enjoy
the
full
life
promised
for
1980
they
and
their
children
must
first
survive
.

But
these
are
side
issues
to
a
powerful
central
theme
.

That
theme
cuts
through
hypocrisies
,
complacency
and
double-talk
.

It
labels
the
slums
,
especially
the
Negro
slums
,
as
dead-end
streets
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
youngsters
.

The
villains
of
the
piece
are
those
who
deny
job
opportunities
to
these
youngsters
,
and
Dr.
Conant
accuses
employers
and
labor
unions
alike
.

He
has
served
in
positions
of
greater
glamour
,
both
at
home
and
abroad
;

Our
creditors
do
not
forget

She
had
,
she
said
,
heard
that
the
plant
was
closing
.

She
had
raised
a
calf
,
grown
it
beef-fat
.

She
had
,
with
her
own
work-weary
hands
,
put
seeds
in
the
ground
,
watched
them
sprout
,
bud
,
blossom
,
and
get
ready
to

A
three-man
committee
has
recommended
to
Commission
Chairman
Charles
O.
Emmerich
that
the
DeKalb
County
cannery
be
closed
.

``
The
cannery
''
,
said
Mrs.
Lewellyn
Lundeen
,
an
active
booster
of
the
cannery
since
its
opening
during
the
war
and
rationing
years
of
1941
,
to
handle
the
``
victory
garden
''
produce
,
``
is
a
service
to
the
taxpayer
.

the
old
couples
.

``
Don't
ask
me
if
I
think
the
cannery
helps
''
,
he
said
.

Most
of
us
would
be
willing
to
admit
that
forgiveness
comes
hard
.

I
know
a
man
who
held
resentment
against
a
neighbor
for
more
than
three
decades
.

Forgiveness
is
the
door
through
which
a
person
must
pass
to
enter
the
Kingdom
of
God
.

We
must
,
first
of
all
,
be
willing
to
forgive
others
before
we
can
secure
God's
forgiveness
.

``
For
if
ye
forgive
men
their
trespasses
,
your
heavenly
Father
will
also
forgive
you
:
but
if
ye
forgive
not
men
their
trespasses
,
neither
will
your
Father
forgive
--
your
trespasses
''
.

In
the
prayer
Jesus
taught
his
disciples
to
pray
we
find
these
words
,
``
Forgive
us
our
debts
''
.

When
a
person
meets
God's
requirements
for
the
experience
of
forgiveness
he
is
forgiven
.

God's
mercy
and
patience
will
last
forever
.

Jesus
saith
unto
him
,
until
seventy
times
seven
''
.

She
asked
.

``
Aren't
you
sure
''
?
?

I
don't
know
any
secret
recipe
for
certainty
.

``
Does
he
ever
bore
you
''
?
?

Why
,
he's
so
darling
and
''

Can
you
visualize
being
stranded
with
him
on
a
desert
island
for
years
and
years
and
still
find
him
fascinating
?
?

Because
,
honey
,
I
thought
silently
,
there
are
plenty
of
desert
islands
in
every
marriage
--
long
periods
when
you're
hopelessly
stranded
,
together
.

She
has
studied
and
observed
and
she
is
convinced
that
her
young
man
is
going
to
be
endlessly
enchanting
.

``
Such
a
church
needs
vigor
and
vitality
in
its
rector
and
one
man
has
only
so
much
of
these
endowments
''
,
he
told
his
members
.

And
so
the
young
minister
resigned
,
to
go
and
study
and
pray
,
having
never
passed
a
day
,
he
told
his
parishioners
,
when
``
I
did
not
gain
from
you
far
more
than
I
ever
gave
to
you
''
.

A
man
who
gives
himself
to
God
and
to
the
believers
of
his
church
takes
upon
himself
a
life
of
giving
.

We
do
not
defeat
the
good
ones
with
this
cruelty
,
but
we
add
to
their
burden
,
while
expecting
them
to
bestow
saintliness
upon
us
in
return
for
ostentatious
church
attendance
and
a
few
bucks
a
week
,
American
cash
.

If
we
break
the
minister
to
our
bit
,
we
are
buying
back
our
own
sins
.

Yet
every
Sunday
we
sinners
go
to
that
emergency
room
to
receive
first
aid
,
and
we
leave
unmindful
that
the
man
who
ministered
to
us
is
a
human
being
who
suffers
,
too
.

Mr.
Podger
always
particularly
enjoyed
the
last
night
of
each
summer
at
Loon
Lake
.

Suddenly
one
young
voice
rose
above
the
others
.

Walking
along
the
lake
before
breakfast
,
Mr.
Podger
had
seen
the
feather
,
and
the
bird
that
had
lost
it
in
flight
.

But
it
was
something
to
have
seen
it
floating
down
through
the
early
morning
sunshine
,
linking
the
blue
of
the
sky
with
the
blue
of
the
asters
by
the
lake
.

Would
the
driver
see
the
turtle
?
?

Mr.
Podger
took
no
chances
.

The
turtle
immediately
withdrew
into
its
private
council
room
to
study
the
phenomenon
.

And
the
turtle
?
?

The
three
would
never
meet
again
,
but
for
some
reason
or
other
Mr.
Podger
was
sure
he
would
always
remember
the
incident
.

If
you're
lyin'
out
in
the
hammock
at
night
,
and
it
gets
kinda
cool
--
you
know
--
you
just
take
these
sides
with
the
fringe
on
--
see
--
and
wrap
'em
right
over
you
.

Mr.
Podger
had
thanked
him
gravely
,
and
now
he
made
use
of
the
advice
.

Alacrity
,
the
Podger
cat
,
came
by
the
hammock
,
rubbed
her
back
briefly
against
it
,
and
then
,
sure
of
a
welcome
,
hopped
up
.

Mr.
Podger
was
just
adding
this
to
his
pictures
of
the
day
when
the
screen
door
opened
and
Pam
burst
out
.

``
It's
getting
so
chilly
we've
lighted
a
fire
,
and
we're
going
to
tell
a
round
robin
story
--
a
nice
,
scary
one
.

We
need
you
to
start
it

Dallas

Desegregation
is
beginning
in
two
more
important
Southern
cities
--
Dallas
and
Atlanta
.

The
program
has
worked
well
in
both
Nashville
and
Houston
.

It
was
part
of
a
citywide
move
toward
full
integration
.

This
is
a
radical
change
in
attitude
from
the
conditions
which
prevailed
several
years
ago
,
when
a
series
of
bombings
was
directed
against
Negroes
who
were
moving
into
previously
all-white
neighborhoods
of
Dallas
.

They
are
putting
strong
pressure
on
their
police
departments
to
keep
order
.

In
the
past
these
same
Southerners
were
inclined
to
look
the
other
way
.

(
2
)
slow
down
and
permit
the
ambivalent
driver
to
change
lanes
;
;

or
(
3
)
alternately
accelerate
and
decelerate
,
thus
keeping
the
first
driver
guessing
as
to
his
intentions
,
thereby
making
a
fascinating
sport
of
the
whole
affair
.

Whether
or
not
this
is
done
out
of
enlightened
self-preservation
,
I
don't
know
.

But
it
is
done
,
consistently
and
I'm
both
surprised
and
impressed
.

In
Chicago
,
the
driver
cut
out
would
likely
jam
his
gas
pedal
to
the
floor
in
an
effort
to
force
the
other
car
back
.

``
It's
a
whole
lot
easier
''
,
he
said
,
``
to
increase
the
population
of
Nevada
,
than
it
is
to
increase
the
population
of
New
York
city
''
.

``
Now
,
if
I
can
just
figure
out
what
he's
talking
about
,
I'll
use
it
''
.

Two
spots
open

This
angle
of
just
where
the
Orioles
can
look
for
improvement
this
year
is
an
interesting
one
.

Obviously
,
if
this
club
is
going
to
move
from
second
to
first
in
the
American
League
,
it
will
have
to
show
improvement
someplace
.

Robby's
performance
last
year
was
tremendous
.

If
they
do
as
well
as
they
did
in
1960
there
can
be
no
complaint
.

Don't
ask
him
more
.

``
They're
the
ones
we
can
expect
to
do
better
''
.

Triandos
hasn't
proved
it
yet
,
but
he
says
he's
convinced
his
thumb
is
all
right
.

So
far
the
platoons
on
left
and
right
fielders
don't
seem
capable
of
carrying
the
load
.

Is
the
mother
of
an
``
autistic
''
child
at
fault
?
?

He
tends
to
treat
himself
and
other
people
as
if
they
were
objects
--
and
sometimes
he
treats
objects
as
if
they
were
people
.

We
believe
that
autism
,
like
so
many
other
conditions
of
defect
and
deviation
,
is
to
a
large
extent
inborn
.

Since
little
is
known
about
autism
,
and
almost
nothing
has
been
written
for
the
layman
,
we'd
like
to
share
one
experienced
mother's
comments
.

As
the
mother
of
an
autistic
child
who
is
lacking
in
interest
and
enthusiasm
about
almost
anything
,
I
have
to
manipulate
my
son's
fingers
for
him
when
he
first
plays
with
a
new
toy
.

I
know
,
that
my
son
wants
control
and
direction
,
but
being
autistic
myself
I
cannot
give
full
control
or
direction
.

As
a
rule
,
the
autistic
child
doesn't
enjoy
physical
contact
with
others
.

Parents
have
to
find
other
ways
of
comforting
him
.

As
he
grows
older
it
may
be
a
matter
of
providing
some
accustomed
object
(
his
``
magic
''
thing
)
.

Or
certain
words
or
rituals
that
child
and
adult
go
through
may
do
the
trick
.

The
answer
is
different
for
each
autistic
child
,
but
for
most
there
is
an
answer
.

What
future
holds

Fortunately
,
there
is
a
nursery
school
which
he
has
been
able
to
attend
,
with
a
group
of
normal
children
.

Many
autistic
children
grow
up
to
lead
relatively
normal
lives
.

Single-color
use

Is
a
relaxed
home
atmosphere
enough
to
help
her
outgrow
these
traits
?
?

No
,
coloring
isn't
exactly
something
you
teach
a
child
.

You
sometimes
give
them
a
little
demonstration
,
a
little
guidance
,
and
suggestions
about
staying
inside
the
lines
.

But
most
learn
to
color
and
paint
as
and
when
they
are
ready
with
only
a
very
little
demonstration
.

Just
as
a
varitinted
Oriental
rug
may
suggest
the
starting
point
for
a
room
scheme
,
so
may
some
of
the
newest
versions
of
embroidery
.

One
such
,
in
fact
,
is
a
rug
.

Though
not
actually
crewel
embroidery
,
it
has
that
look
with
its
over-stitched
raised
pattern
in
blue
,
pink
,
bronze
and
gold
and
a
sauterne
background
.

Traditional
crewel
embroidery
which
seems
to
be
appearing
more
frequently
this
fall
than
in
the
past
few
years
is
still
available
in
this
country
.

Since
the
work
is
done
by
hand
,
the
only
limitation
,
it
is
said
,
``
is
that
of
human
conception
''
.

An
amateur
decorator
might
try
her
hand
at
a
pair
during
the
long
winter
evenings
,
and
,
by
picking
up
her
living
room
color
scheme
,
add
a
decorative
do-it-yourself
note
to
the
room
.

They
seem
darned
proud
of
it
.

Their
meeting
at
San
Francisco
is
nominally
scheduled
as
a
conference
of
the
California
Democratic
Council
directorate
.

--
And
proposals
for
a
whole
series
of
lesser
candidate-picking
conventions
in
the
state's
38
new
Congressional
districts
.

Much
of
its
strength
stems
from
the
comfortable
knowledge

Shunted
aside
by
the
rampant
organizers
for
John
F.
Kennedy
last
year
,
who
relegated
it
to
a
somewhat
subordinate
role
in
the
Presidential
campaign
,
the
CDC
plainly
intends
to
provide
the
party's
campaign
muscle
in
1962
.

There
is
evidence
that
it
will
be
happily
received
by
Gov.
Brown
and
the
other
constitutional
incumbents
.

But
the
rest
of
the
GOP
gubernatorial
aspirants
don't
worry
him
very
much
.

In
his
CDC
work
,
Carvey
has
the
close-in
support
and
advice
of
one
of
California's
shrewdest
political
strategists
:
former
Democratic
National
Committeeman
Paul
Ziffren
,
who
backed
him
over
a
Northland
candidate
espoused
by
Atty.
Gen.
Stanley
Mosk
.

state
and
county
committeemen
,
CDC
directors
and
representatives
,
members
of
16
area

,
and
``
all

''
have
been
invited
.

For
some
compulsive
reason
which
would
have
fascinated
Dr.
Freud
,
Communists
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
almost
invariably
impute
to
others
the
very
motives
which
they
harbor
themselves
.

President
Kennedy's
latest
warning
to
the
Communist
world
that
the
United
States
will
build
up
its
military
strength
to
meet
any
challenge
in
Berlin
or
elsewhere
was
,
somewhat
surprisingly
,
reported
in
full
text
or
fairly
accurate
excerpts
behind
the
Iron
Curtain
.

Then
the
Communese
reply
came
back
from
many
mouthpieces
with
striking
consistency
.

``
President
Kennedy
once
again
interpreted
the
Soviet
proposals
,
to
sign
a
peace
treaty
with
Germany
as
a
threat
,
as
part
of
the
world
menace
allegedly
looming
over
the
countries
of
capitalism
.

The
West
Berlin
crisis
is
being
played
up
artificially
because
it
is
needed
by
the
United
States
to
justify
its
arms

The
``

is
really
an
East

The
reason
was
to
speed
up

The

neither

Among
the
many
stories
about
the
late
Speaker
Rayburn
is
one
from
Rep.
Dwyer
,

Dist.
.

However
,
Biblical
scholars
frequently
attested
to
its
numerous
inaccuracies
,
as
old
manuscripts
were
uncovered
and
scholarship
advanced
.

This
resulted
in
revisions
of
the
King
James
Bible
in
1881-85
as
the
English
Revised
Version
and
in
1901
as
the
American
Standard
Version
.

For
example
,
in
the
third
chapter
of
Matthew
,
verses
13-16
,
describing
the
baptism
of
Jesus
,
the
1611
version
reads
:

``
Then
cometh
Jesus
from
Galilee
to
Jordan
unto
John
,
to
be
baptized
of
him
.

``
But
John
forbad
him
,
saying
,
I
have
need
to
be
baptized
of
thee
,
and
comest
thou
to
me
?
?

'
I
need
rather
to
be
baptized
by
you
.

After
baptism
Jesus
came
up
out
of
the
water
at
once
,
and
at
that
moment
heaven
opened
;
;

he
saw
the
Spirit
of
God
descending
like
a
dove
to
alight
upon
him
''
;
;

Among
the
most
frequently
quoted
Biblical
sentences
are
the
Beatitudes
and
yet
so
few
persons
,
other
than
scholars
,
really
understand
the
true
meaning
of
these
eight
blessings
uttered
by
Jesus
at
the
beginning
of
the
Sermon
on
the
Mount
.

To
illustrate
,
the
first
blessing
in
the
King
James
Bible
reads
:
``
Blessed
are
the
poor
in
spirit
;
;

In
the
second
and
third
chapters
of
Revelation
the
new
version
retains
,
however
,
the
old
phrase
``
angel
of
the
church
''
which
Biblical
scholars
have
previously
interpreted
as
meaning
bishop
.

For
the
most
part
,
however
,
the
new
version
is
contemporary
and
,
as
such
,
should
be
the
means
for
many
to
attain
a
clearer
comprehension
of
the
meaning
of
those
words
recorded
so
many
hundreds
of
years
ago
by
the
first
followers
of
Christ
.

Discoveries
recently
made
of
old
Biblical
manuscripts
in
Hebrew
and
Greek
and
other
ancient
writings
,
some
by
the
early
church
fathers
,
in
themselves
called
for
a
restudy
of
the
Bible
.

To
have
the
results
recorded
in
everyday
usable
English
should
be
of
benefit
to
all
who
seek
the
truth
.

With
contemporary
English
changing
with
the
rapidity
that
marks
this
jet
age
,
some
of
the
words
and
phrases
of
the
new
version
may
themselves
soon
become
archaic
.

The
New
Testament
offered
to
the
public
today
is
the
first
result
of
the
work
of
a
joint
committee
made
up
of
representatives
of
the
Church
of
England
,
Church
of

There

This
is
the
period
during
the
melancholy
days
of
autumn
when
universities
and
colleges
schedule
what
they
call
``
Homecoming
Day
''
.

It
is
at
precisely
such
moments
that
he
encounters
a
couple
of
undergraduates
,
faces
alight
,
holding
hands
and
talking
happily
as
they
come
along
,
oblivious
of
him
,
or
throwing
him
the
most
fleeting
and
casual
of
glances
,
such
as
they
would
give
a
tethered

.

By
then
one
begins
to
notice
the
middle-age
spread
;
;

It
is
,
if
anything
,
worse
on
the
old
player

Of
40
cities
with
populations
of
300,000
and
more
,
Mr.
Kennedy
carried
26
and
Mr.
Nixon
14
.

There
are
eight
states
in
which
the
largest
urban
vote
can
be
the
balance
of
power
in
any
close
election
.

Mr.
Nixon
,
despite
a
very
earnest
effort
to
capture
the
minority
groups
,
failed
to
do
so
.

'
task
force
'

A
GOP
``
task
force
'
committee
will
seek
to
find
out
how
its
party
may
win
support
from
the
ethnic
and
minority
groups
in
cities
.

The
task
force
might
make
a
start
in
Washington
with
Republican
congressional
leaders
.

The
present
Republican
leadership
as
practiced
by
Mundt
,
Goldwater
,
Bridges
,
Dirksen
,
et
al
,
is
repeating
the
errors
of
the
party
leadership
of
the
1930s
.

In
that
decade
the
partisan
zeal
to
defend
Mr.
Hoover
,
and
the
party's
failure
to
anticipate
or
cope
with
the
depression
,
caused
a
great
majority
of
Americans
to
see
the
Republican
party
as
cold
and
lacking
in
any
sympathy
for
the
problems
of
human
beings
caught
up
in
the
distress
and
suffering
brought
on
by
the
economic
crash
.

The
Republican
party
was
not
lacking
in
humanity
,
but
it
permitted
its
extremely
partisan
leadership
to
make
it
appear
devoid
of
any
consideration
for
people
in
trouble
.

That
this
is
not
good
politics
is
underscored
by
the
latest
poll
figures
which
show
that
72
per
cent
of
the
people
like
the
way
in
which
the
new
President
is
conducting
the
nation's
business
.

The
most
articulate
Republicans
are
those
who
,
in
their
desire
to
get
back
at
Mr.
Kennedy
,
already
have
created
the
image
of
a
Republican
leadership
which
is
reluctant
to
assist
the
distressed
and
the
unemployed
,
and
which
is
even
more
unwilling
to
help
old
people
who
need
medical
care
.

It
will
early
know
why
the
party
won't
win
back
city
votes
.

How
unpartisan
will
be
the
recommendations
of
Lt.
Gov.
Garland
Byrd's
Senate
Committee
on
Government
Operations
?
?

Neither
had
a
choice
other
than
to
accept
the
invitation
.

To
have
refused
would
have
been
political
suicide
.

And
it
may
be
that
one
or
both
men
actually
welcomed
the
opportunity
,
when
the
bravado
comments
are
cast
aside
.

``
If
an
opponent
accuses
you
of
lying
,
don't
deny
it

The
trouble
is
that
at
first
glance
the
idea
looks
like
such
a
good
one

Why
not
have

would
present
a

almost

community

not

no

.

While

cited
the
anticipated
increase
in
school
costs
in
answer
to
a
direct
question
from
a
taxpayer
,
the
impact
upon
a
school
system
does
not
have
to
be
measured
only
in
increased
taxes
to
find
alarm
in
uncontrolled
growth
.

If
they
are
to
be
commended
for
foresight
in
their
planning
,
what
then
is
the
judgment
of
a
town
council
that
compounds
this
problem
during
the
planning
stage
?
?

Greenwich

to
enter
into

agreement
with
the
Rhode
Island
Development
Council
for
planning
services
we
could
not
provide
for
ourselves
.

I
believe
it
is
an
area
in
which
professional
planners
have
failed
to
set
adequate
guide
posts
;
;

and
yet
they
cannot
ignore
this
problem
because
it
concerns
the
implementation
of
nearly
all
the
planning
programs
they
have
devised
.

These
programs
are
volumes
of
waste
paper
and
lost
hours
if
the
citizens
of
a
community
must
stand
aside
while
land
developers
tell
them
when
,
where
,
and
in
what
manner
the
community
shall
grow
.

We
have
far
less
to
fear
in
the
migrant
family
than
we
have
in
the
migrant
developer
under
these
conditions
.

I
would
like
very
much
,
on

of
my

and
myself

The

On
the
question
of
admission
to
Veterans

hospitals
of
service-connected
and
non-service-connected
disabled
veterans
,
it
must
be
recognized
that
there
are
many
men
who
are
greatly
affected
by
war
service
.

The
arguments
advanced
by
those
individuals

groups

oppose

in
force
and
who
would
drastically
curtail
or
do
away
entirely
with
hospital
care
for
the
non-service-connected
case
,
seem
to
be
coldly
impractical
and
out-of-step
with
the
wishes
of
the
general
public
.

He
has
no
experience

this
veteran's

I
just
want
to
let
you
know
how
much
I
enjoyed
your
June
25
article
on
Liberace
,
and
to
thank
you
for
it
.

Your
July
26
editorial
regarding
the
position
of
Attorney
General
Robert
F.
Kennedy
on
prospective
tax
relief
for
DuPont
stockholders
is
based
on
an
erroneous
statement
of
fact
.

As
a
result
,
your
criticism
of
Attorney
General
Robert
F.
Kennedy
and
the
Department
of
Justice
was
inaccurate
,
unwarranted
and
unfair
.

Congressman
Wilbur
D.
Mills
,
chairman
of
the
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
,
asked
the
Department
of
Justice
for
its
views
on
these
legislative
proposals
as
they
related
to
anti-trust
law
enforcement
.

Copies
of
this

Should
she
disagree

Such
tactics
reek
of
totalitarianism
!
!

To
our
knowledge
no
nurse
in
our
agency
has
been
employed
because
of
political
affiliation
.

We
,
therefore
,
considered
the
``
suggestion
''
an
insult
to
our
intelligence
,
ethics
,
Bill
of

,
etc.
.

Our
only
obligation
for
this
day
is
to
vote
,
free
of

,
for
the
person
we
feel
is
capable
in
directing
the

.

Does
this

live
in
a

where
all
are
free
loaders
unwilling
to
help
themselves
,
but
ready
to
demand
that
``
the

''
help
and
protect
them
?
?

If
in
a
town
of
2,000
private
homes
,
half
of

have
shelters
,
the

for

reduced
to
that
extent

Sir
--
Permit
me
to
commend
your
editorial
in
which
you
stress
the
fact
that
a
program
of

will
substantially
increase
local
tax
burdens
and
that
taxpayers
have
a
right
to
a
clear
idea
of
what
such
a

would
commit
them
to
.

The

last
May

It

certainly
make

also
make

that

Working
for
peace

Recently
the
secretary
of
the
Friends
Committee
on
National
Legislation
was
interviewed
on
the
air
.

.

In
1950
,
Public
Law
920
created
Civil
Defense
(
different
from
Civilian-groups
of
World
War
2
)
,
a
responsibility
of
the
Government
at
all
levels
to
help
reduce
loss
of
life
and
property
in
disaster
,
natural
or
manmade
.

Could
Senator
Humphrey
be
serious
in
his
proposal
?
?

For
a
neutral
Germany

Soviets
said
to
fear
resurgence
of
German
militarism

For
the
first
time
in
history
the
entire
world
is
dominated
by
two
large
,
powerful
nations
armed
with
murderous
nuclear
weapons
that
make
conventional
warfare
of
the
past
a
nullity
.

The
United
States
and
Soviet
Russia
have
enough
nuclear
weapons
to
destroy
all
nations
.

The
fact
is
that
the
Italians
,
French
and
British
know
that
they
have
no
defense
against
nuclear
bombs
.

If
the
German
people
favor
such
a
settlement
we
should
not
oppose
Germany
following
the
example
of
Austria
.

Why
not
make
a
beginning
with
a
united
and
disarmed
Germany
whose
neutrality
and
immunity
from
nuclear
bombing
would
be
guaranteed
by
the
Big
Four
powers
and
the
United
States
?
?

A
united
Germany
,
freed
of
militarism
,
might
be
the
first
step
toward
disarmament
and
peace
in
a
terrorized
and
tortured
world
.

I
would
like
to
quote
from
the
Charter
of
the
United
Nations
:

``
Article
17
,
Section
1
:
:

A
Member
of
the
United
Nations
which
is
in
arrears
in
the
payment
of
its
financial
contributions
to
the
Organization
shall
have
no
vote
in
the
General
Assembly
if
the
amount
of
its
arrears
equals
or
exceeds
the
amount
of
the
contributions
due
from
it
for
the
preceding
two
full
years
''
.

The
U.S.S.R.
and
her
followers
are
careful
in
paying
their
obligations
to
the
regular
budget
.

to
the
editor
of
the
New
York
Times
:

If
the
case
is
thus
determined
by
us
to
be
domestic
,
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
.

Our
``
destiny
''
in
these
perilous
times
should
be
to
lead
strongly
in
the
pursuit
of
peace
,
with
justice
,
under
law
.

criticized

It
has
not
been
any
great
mental
effort
on
my
part
to
keep
up
with
this
mechanization
which
has
brought
about
new
ways
of
dialing
.

Either
it
is
lack
of
training
,
lack
of
proper
screening
when
hiring
,
lack
of
management
or
possibly
lack
of
interest
on
the
part
of
the
telephone
company
,
which
does
have
a
Government-blessed
monopoly
.

I
disagree
with
the
writer
who
says
funeral
services

be

more

suppose
I
am
missing
some
elementary
point
but
I
honestly
cannot
see
how
two
wrongs
can
make
a
right
!
!

If
an
atom
bomb
in
1945
could
destroy
an
entire
city
surely
the
atomic
arsenal
we
now
have
is
more
than
adequate
to
fulfill
any
military
objective
required
of
it
.

'
we
tremble

'

Especially
the
first
half
of
the
third
verse
:

out
of
the
race

The
war
could
have
continued
many
years
with
many
thousands
killed
on
both
sides
.

Intelligent
people
will
admit
that
bombs
and
rockets
of
destruction
are
frightening
whether
they
fall
on
Japan
,
London
or
Pearl
Harbor
.

Russia
has
showed
its
intentions
by
exploding
bombs
in
peace
time
to
try
to
frighten
the
world
.

It
is
well
for
us
to
remember
that

on

never
can
atone
for

to
the
editor
of

:

One
of
the
problems
associated
with

stems
from
the
basic
idea
.

This
can
be
accomplished
by
several
logical

lane

Fairmount
Park
Commission

They
are
the
most
beautiful
part
of
that
little
piece
of
nature
.

Starlings
and
blackbirds
are
scared
off
by
canon
,
from
City
Hall
.

Let
every
policeman
and
park
guard
keep
his
eye
on
John
and
Jane
Doe
,
lest
one
piece
of
bread
be
placed
undetected
and
one
bird
survive
.

Let
them
offer
on
behalf
of
those
creatures
whose
melody
has
been
the
joy
of
mankind
since
time
began
,
the
hymn
``
Abide
With
Me
''
.

We
will
know
,
and
He
will
know
,
to
whom
it
is
rendered
,
what
the
birds
would
ask
:

Anyone
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
McClellan
hearings
must
at
once
realize
that
the
sweetheart
arrangements
augmented
employer
profits
far
more
than
they
augmented
the
earnings
of
the
corruptible
labor
leaders
.

Some
time
ago
,
however
,
Mr.
Khrushchev
decided
that
when
bigger
bombs
were
made
,
the
Soviet
Union
would
make
them
.

He
seems
to
have
at
least
a
few
30-
and
50-megaton
bombs
on
hand
,
since
we
cannot
assume
that
he
has
exploded
his
entire
stock
.

``
The
discontinuity
can
either
be
that
of
war
to
destruction
,
or
that
of
diplomatic
policy
''
.

If
this
capacity
had
not
failed
them
,
they
would
see
that
their
enemy
has
made
a
disastrous
miscalculation
.

A
compromise
will
leave
both
sides
without
the
glow
of
triumph
,
but
it
will
save
Berlin
.

Besides
,
he
can
hardly
avoid
musing
on
the
instability
of
death
which
,
what
with
exhumations
and
rehabilitations
,
seems
to
match
that
of
life
.

If
Nikita
buys
a
small
plot
in
some
modest
rural
cemetery
,
everyone
will
understand
.

U
Thant
of
course
,
will
hold
office
until
the
spring
of
1963
,
when
Mr.
Hammarskjold's
term
would
have
come
to
an
end
.

the
West
may
or
not
remain
satisfied
with
the
kind
of
neutralism
that
U
Thant
represents
.

The
country
is
committed
to
the
doctrine
of
security
by
military
means
.

A
more
dangerous
formula
for
national
frustration
cannot
be
imagined
.

As
the
civic
temper
rises
,
the
more
naive
citizens
begin
to
play
soldier
--
but
the
guns
are
real
.

Soon
they
will
begin
to
hunt
down
the
traitors
they
are
assured
are
in
our
midst
.

Here
,
then
,
is
what
Swift
would
have
called
a
modest
proposal
by
way
of
a
beginning
.

A
special
grandstand
,
protected
by
awnings
from
the
midsummer
sun
of
Illinois
,
should
be
erected
for
occupancy
by
honored
guests
,
who
should
include
the
ambassadors
of
all
those
new
African
nations
as
yet
not
quite
convinced
that
the
United
States
is
thoroughly
civilized
.

Moreover
,
the
salubrious
effects
would
not
be
exclusively
political
,
but
at
least
partially
,
and
perhaps
primarily
social
.

Somehow
our
contemporary
Moloch
must
be
induced
to
see
reason
.

As
the
new
clouds
of
radioactive
fallout
spread
silently
and
invisibly
around
the
earth
,
the
Soviet
Union
stands
guilty
of
a
monstrous
crime
against
the
human
race
.

But
the
guilt
is
shared
by
the
United
States
,
Britain
and
France
,
the
other
members
of
the
atomic
club
.

Shock
,
dismay
and
foreboding
for
future
generations
were
legitimate
reactions
;
;

More
recently
,
the
chairman
of
the
Atomic
Energy
Commission
,
Dr.
Glenn
T.
Seaborg
,
``
admitted
''
to
a
news
conference
in
Las
Vegas
,
Nevada
,
that
the
US
might
fall
behind
Russia
(
he
apparently
meant
in
weapons
development
)
if
the
Soviets
continue
to
test
in
the
atmosphere
while
we
abstain
.

The
trial
balloons
are
afloat
.

All
of
which
makes
it
more
imperative
than
ever
that
the
biological
and
genetic
effects
of
fallout
be
understood
.

But
for
the
average
citizen
,
unfortunately
,
this
is
one
of
science's
worst-marked
channels
,
full
of
tricky
currents
and
unknown
depths
.

Once
again
,
the
United
States
must
choose
.

The
second
choice
,
full
testing
,
has
become
even
more
risky
just
because
the
current
Soviet
tests
have
already
dangerously
contaminated
the
atmosphere
.

one
which
,
should
it
fail
,
will
not
have
contaminated
the
conscience
.

Leaving
aside
the
choice
of
unilateral
cessation
of
tests
as
neither
sane
nor
clearly
moral
,
the
question
must
arise
as
to
why
resumption
of
atmospheric
tests
on
our
part
would
not
be
a
good
choice
.

What
was
missing
in
the
Governor's
argument
,
as
in
so
many
similar
arguments
,
was
a
premise
which
would
enable
one
to
make
the
ethical
leap
from
what
might
be
militarily
desirable
to
what
is
right
.

It
is
perfectly
conceivable
that
a
resumption
of
atmospheric
tests
may
,
at
some
point
in
the
future
,
be
necessary
and
even
justifiable
.

The
Council
we
now
know
will
concern
itself
directly
only
with
the
internal
affairs
of
the
Church
.

A
major
aim
of
the
Council
will
be
to
remove
as
far
as
possible
whatever
in
the
Church
today
stands
in
the
way
of
unity
.

Nor
can
one
forget
Pope
John's
unprecedented
meeting
with
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.

For
discouragement
,
or
the
temptation
to
abandon
our
efforts
,
``
would
show
that
one
placed
excessive
trust
in
purely
human
means
without
thinking
of
the
omnipotence
of
God
,
the
irresistible
efficacy
of
prayer
,
the
action
of
Christ
or
the
power
of
the
Divine
Spirit
''
.

The
Eisenhower
budget
was
simultaneously
inadequate
in
its
provisions
and
yet
extravagant
in
its
projections
of
revenue
to
be
received
.

We
wish
the
President
would
remember
that
``
fiscal
responsibility
''
was
the
battle-cry
of
the
party
that
lost
the
election
.

Speakers
declared
that
Protestants
often
make
use
of
it
,
if
,
perhaps
,
by
some
other
name
.

The
impression
was
unmistakable
that
,
whatever
one
may
choose
to
call
it
,
natural
law
is
a
functioning
generality
with
a
certain
objective
existence
.

I
was
searching
for
an
accent
of
self-delusion
or
,
even
,
of
hypocrisy
.

What
evidence
is
there
of
an
objective
kind
that
in
fact
your
government
proposes
to
do
just
that
,
and
that
it
can
be
done
''
?
?

So
you
yourself
must
seek
these
objective
data
,
and
come
to
your
own
conclusions
.

What
are
the
relevant
data
?
?

If
the
raw
population
figures
are
crucially
relevant
,
then
it
is
idle
to
think
of
liberation
,
as
idle
as
to
suppose
that
Poland
might
liberate
Russia
.

Relative
military
manpower
?
?

Even
so
,
it
adds
up
to
impossible
odds
,
except
that
the
question
arises
,
On
whose
side
would
the
Mainland
Chinese
army
fight
?
?

It
has
not
been
extirpated
by
ten
years
of
Communist
depersonalization
.

The
immediate
families
of
the
generals
and
the
admirals
are
well
fed
:
a
despot
does
not
economize
on
his
generals
.

In
behalf
of
what
?
?

A
friendly
state
,
sometimes
only
semi-independent
,
but
never
hostile
.

Tibet
is
too
vast
,
the
terrain
is
too
difficult
.

The
imposition
of
yet
another
pressure
,
a
strong
one
,
from
the
outside
,
might
cause
it
to
snap
.

On
these
they
feel
they
can
rely
.

But
he
--
and
all
of
China
--
wears
the
scars
of
American
indecisiveness
,
and
he
knows
what
an
uncertain
ally
we
are
.

We
have
been
grand
to
Formosa
itself
--
lots
of
aid
,
and
,
most
of
the
time
,
a
policy
of
support
for
the
offshore
islands
.

A
truth-revealing
crisis
erupted
in
Katanga
for
a
couple
of
days
this
month
,
to
be
quickly
smothered
by
the
high
pressure
verbal
fog
that
is
kept
on
tap
for
such
emergencies
.

But
I
am
here
concerned
more
with
policy
than
with
men
.

The
United
States
was
engaged
in
a
military
attack
on
a
peaceful
,
orderly
people
governed
by
a
regime
that
had
proved
itself
the
most
pro-Western
and
anti-Communist
within
any
of
the
new
nations
--
the
only
place
in
Africa
,
moreover
,
where
a
productive
relationship
between
whites
and
blacks
had
apparently
been
achieved
.

By
our
policy
the
West
was
--
is
--
split
.

But
the
key
revelation
is
not
new
.

It
reappears
,
in
whole
or
part
,
whenever
a
new
crisis
exposes
the
reality
:
in
Cuba
last
spring
(
with
which
the
Dominican
events
of
last
month
should
be
paired
)
;
;

in
relation
to
Laos
,
Algeria
,
South
Africa
;
;

right
now
,
with
almost
cartoon
emphasis
,
in
the
temporally
linked
complex
of
Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana
.

The
U.S.
cannot
take
the
initiative
against
the
Left
.

We
can
vote
in
the
UN
against
South
African
apartheid
or
Portuguese
rule
in
Angola
,
but
we
cannot
even
introduce
a
motion
on
the
Berlin
Wall
--
much
less
,
give
the
simple
order
to
push
the
Wall
down
.

As
our
planes
land
the
war
materiel
that
kills
pro-Western
Katangans
,
we
stand
supinely
bleating
while
Nehru's
troops
smash
into
a
five-hundred-year-old
district
of
our
NATO
ally
,
Portugal
.

What
explains
this
uni-directional
paralysis
?
?

To
get
started
,
he
does
not
scan
the
world
about
him
;
;

Of
straight
dramas
,
there
are
All
The
Way
Home
,
which
owes
much
of
its
poetic
power
to
the
James
Agee
novel
,
A
Death
In
The
Family
;
;

The
only
original
works
attempting
to
reach
any
stature
:
Tennessee
Williams'
disappointing
domestic
comedy
,
Period
Of
Adjustment
,
and
Arthur
Laurents'
clever
but
empty
Invitation
To
A
March
.

Wildcat
and
The
Unsinkable
Molly
Brown
were
originals
,
but
pretty
bad
,
leaving
top
honors
again
to
an
import
--
the
jaunty
and
charmingly
French
Irma
La
Douce
.

That
exchange
was
not
only
possible
but
commonplace
last
week
in
Manhattan
,
as
more
and
more
New
Yorkers
were
discovering
29th
Street
and
Eighth
Avenue
,
where
half
a
dozen
small
nightclubs
with
names
like
Arabian
Nights
,
Grecian
Palace
and
Egyptian
Gardens
are
the
American
inpost
of
belly
dancing
.

Except
for
the
odd
uptown
sex
maniac
or
an
overeager
Greek
sailor
,
the
people
watch
in
calm
absorption
.

the
def
,
a
low-pitched
tambourine
.

All
over
the
country
,
belly
clubs
have
never
been
bigger
,
especially
in
Detroit
,
Boston
and
Chicago
,
and
even
in
small
towns
;
;

The
girls
are
kept
booked
and
moving
by
several
agents
,
notably
voluble
,
black-bearded
Murat
Somay
,
a
Manhattan
Turk
who
is
the
Sol
Hurok
of
the
central
abdomen
.

He
can
offer
nine
Turkish
girls
,
plans
to
import
at
least
15
more
.

Many
belly
dancers
are
married
,
but
Serene
is
one
of
the
few
who
will
admit
it
.

A
short
,
tormented
span

The
show
has
been
to
Boston
and
Manhattan
,
will
in
time
reach
Pittsburgh
and
Minneapolis
.

Schiele's
paintings
are
anything
but
pleasant
.

His
people
(
see
color
)
are
angular
and
knobby-knuckled
,
sometimes
painfully
stretched
,
sometimes
grotesquely
foreshortened
.

When
he
was
15
,
his
parents
finally
allowed
him
to
attend
classes
at
the
Academy
of
Fine
Arts
in
Vienna
.

Cried
one
professor
after
a
few
months
of
Student
Schiele's
tantrums
and
rebellion
:
``
The
devil
himself
must
have
defecated
you
into
my
classroom
''
!
!

He
himself
was
once
convicted
of
painting
erotica
and
jailed
for
24
days
--
the
first
three
of
which
he
spent
desperately
trying
to
make
paintings
on
the
wall
with
his
own
spittle
.

The
children
he
painted
were
almost
always
in
rags
,
his
portraits
were
often
ruthless
to
the
point
of
ugliness
,
and
his
nudes
--
including
several
self-portraits
--
were
stringy
,
contorted
and
strangely
pathetic
.

The
subject
he
liked
most
was
the
female
body
,
which
he
painted
in
every
state
--
naked
,
half-dressed
,
muffled
to
the
ears
,
sitting
primly
in
a
chair
,
lying
tauntingly
on
a
bed
or
locked
in
an
embrace
.

These
never
ceased
to
suggest
that
if
,
in
the
eyes
of
Marx
and
Lenin
``
full
communism
''
was
still
a
very
distant
ideal
,
the
establishment
of
a
Communist
society
had
now
,
under
Khrushchev
,
become
an
``
immediate
and
tangible
reality
''
.

It
seems
that
Khrushchev
himself
took
a
very
special
pride
in
having
made
a
world-shaking
contribution
to
Marxist
doctrine
with
his
Draft
Program
(
a
large
part
of
his
twelve-hour
speech
at
the
recent
Congress
was
,
in
fact
,
very
largely
a
rehash
of
that
interminable
document
)
.

Their
plan
for
rotation
of
leaders
promised
a
salutary
blow
at
``
bureaucracy
''
and
would
enable
``
the
people
''
to
take
a
more
direct
and
active
part
in
running
the
country
.

Also
,
elections
would
be
more
democratic
;
;

Molotov
,
in
particular
,
is
being
charged
with
all
kinds
of
sins
--
especially
with
wanting
to
cut
down
free
public
services
,
to
increase
rents
and
fares
;
;

The
trouble
with
all
these
doctrinal
quarrels
is
that
we
hear
only
one
side
of
the
story
:
what
,
in
the
secret
councils
of
the
Kremlin
,
Molotov
had
really
proposed
,
we
just
don't
know
,
and
he
has
had
no
chance
to
reply
.

It
is
extremely
doubtful
that
the
handful
of
Albanians
who
call
themselves
Communists
could
have
done
this
without
the
direct
approval
of
their
Chinese
friends
.

But
Albania
is
merely
a
symptom
of
a
real
malaise
between
China
and
Russia
.

But
it
seems
that
pressures
against
him
are
coming
from
somewhere
--
in
the
first
place
from
China
,
but
perhaps
also
from
that
``
China
Lobby
''
which
,
I
was
assured
in
Moscow
nearly
two
years
ago
,
exists
on
the
quiet
inside
the
party
.

The
fact
that
China
(
which
is
obsessed
by
Formosa
--
to
Khrushchev
a
very
small
matter
)
should
be
supported
by
North
Korea
and
North
Vietnam
is
highly
indicative
.

The
Chinese
,
North
Vietnamese
and
North
Koreans
,
on
the
other
hand
,
feel
that
,
militarily
,
Russia
is
strong
enough
to
support
them
in
the
``
just
wars
of
liberation
''
they
would
like
to
embark
on
before
long
:
with
China
attacking
Formosa
and
the
North
Koreans
and
North
Vietnamese
liberating
the
southern
half
of
their
respective
countries
.

he
may
break
with
China
(
which
would
be
infernally
difficult
and
perhaps
disastrous
)
,
or
he
may
succeed
,
by
all
kinds
of
dangerous
concessions
,
in
persuading
China
to
be
patient
.

On
a
misty
Sunday
morning
last
month
,
a
small
band
of
militant
anti-Communists
called
the
Minutemen
held
maneuvers
in
a
foggy
field
about
fifteen
miles
east
of
here
.

To
the
average
American
,
this
must
sound
like
an
incredible
tale
from
a
Saturday
night
TV
movie
.

Hence
all
teachers
,
good
and
bad
,
who
have
been
teaching
for
a
given
number
of
years
are
paid
the
same
salary
.

Without
this
power
we
lay
open
any
American
industry
which
the
Europeans
may
find
it
economically
profitable
to
destroy
to
the
will
of
others
.

It
is
this
loss
of
initiative
in
how
we
conduct
our
economy
which
may
lead
to
the
loss
of
initiative
in
how
we
conduct
our
political
affairs
.

For
him
to
ignore
the
political
consequences
involved
in
an
Atlantic
Union
of
this
kind
is
difficult
to
understand
.

The
pressure
for
our
entry
to
the
Common
Market
is
mounting
and
we
will
proceed
towards
this
amalgamated
trade
union
by
way
of
a
purely
``
economic
thoroughfare
''
,
or
garden
path
,
with
the
political
ramifications
kept
neatly
in
the
background
.

We
would
lose
our
export
markets
and
deny
ourselves
the
imports
we
need
.

If
we
go
into
this
Common
Market
,
we
might
just
as
well
stop
talking
about
Constitutional
guarantees
,
Connally
Amendments
or
,
for
that
matter
,
conservatism
in
general
.

Mental
telepathy
?
?

This
time
,
added
to
that
which
I
had
already
spent
in
school
prior
to
my
induction
in
1954
,
makes
a
total
of
twenty-two
(
22
)
years
of
education
.

Taken
back
into
the
Army
now
as
an
Sp

,
I
am
leaving
110
college
students
whose
teacher
I
am

If
the

troops
are

Hessians
were
not
mercenaries
either

In
the
issue
of
March
5
,
1960
you
had
an
excellent
editorial
which
said
:

``
On
trial
in
Jakarta
for
having
flown
for
the
Indonesian
anti-Communist
insurgents
,
U.S.
pilot
Alan
Lawrence
Pope
boldly
told
the
court
that
in
supporting
the
freedom
fighters
,
he
was
actually
defending
the
sovereignty
and
independence
of
Indonesia
.

I
have
done
all
this
for
the
freedom
of
the
individuals
concerned
and
also
for
the
states
which
have
been
threatened
by
Communist
domination
.

was

last

of

missions
.

He
has
been
in
prison
since
May
,
1958
,
when
his
aircraft
was
shot
down
over
Moluccas
.

As
we
see
,
Pope
may
appeal
to
President
Sukarno
,
Khrushchev's
friend
,
for
clemency
.

The
Eleanor
Roosevelt

But
who
will
act

immediately

of
Alan
Pope

F.
L.
Lucas's
article
in
SR's
April
1
issue
seemed
to
be
a
very
fair
and
objective
analysis
of
the
New
English
Bible
.

We
don't
need
this
type
of
protection
any
more
.

Up
until
now
,
the
networks
have
grudgingly
run
half-hour
tapes
at
5
P.M.
or
sometimes
7
or
10:30
P.M.
.

However
,
by
comparing
the
TV
snatches
,
two
different
radio
station
re-runs
,
and
the
censored
Los
Angeles
Times
version
,
I
found
that
the
radio
stations
had
edited
out
questions
(
ABC
removed
the
one
regarding
Laos
)
or
even
a
paragraph
out
of
the
middle
of
the
President's
answer
.

I
don't
know
if
this
is
the
situation
in
other
parts
of
the
country
;
;

He
did
mention
in
his
column
the
fact
that
he
had
received
many
letters
about
this
and
he
himself
did
not
understand
the
networks
and
the
independent
local
stations'
not
doing
this
--
but
nothing
happened
.

I
was
interested
in
James
Webb
Young's
Madison
Avenue
column
in
which
he
raised
the
question
:
``
Do
We
Need
a
College
of
Propaganda
''
?
?

and
the
sad
part
of
it
is
that
we
had
one
,
which
was
rounding
into
excellent
shape
,
and
we
let
it
disintegrate
and
die
.

Four
of
us
here
in
the
United
States
attended
,
first
as
students
,
then
as
instructors
,
almost
every
one
of
these
schools
,
in
England
,
Canada
,
and
the
United
States
.

We
set
up
the
Lloyd's
Neck
school
,
worked
out
its
curriculum
,
and
taught
there
.

We
hoped
that
its
practitioners
and
teachers
might
be
put
on
some
sort
of
reserve
list
and
called
back
for
refresher
courses
each
year
or
so
.

``
I
have
read
an
advance
copy
of
the
Snow
book
which
is
to
be
titled
,
'
Science
And
Government
.

Until
the
work
actually
appears
I
am
not
privileged
to
analyze
it
publicly
in
detail
.

Sir
Robert
Watson-Watt's
``
rebuttal
''
of
Sir
Charles
Snow's
Godkin
Lectures
is
marred
throughout
by
too
forceful
a
desire
to
defend
Lindemann
and
apparently
himself
from
Sir
Charles'
supposed
falsehoods
while
stating
those
``
falsehoods
''
in
an
unclear
incoherent
argument
.

The
article
presents
the
reader
with
an
absurdity
at
its
beginning
.

But
we
are
to
believe
that
Lindemann
actively
supported
radar
outside
the
Tizard
Committee
,
and
dissembling
,
discounted
it
inside
?
?

To
the
unfortunate
people
unable
to
attend
the
Godkin
lectures
it
casts
an
unjustifiable
aura
of
falsehood
over
the
book
which
may
dissuade
some
people
from
reading
it
.

This
time
the
orchestra
gave
him
some
superb
support
fired
by
response
to
his
own
high
mood
.

But
he
had
in
Walter
Hendl
a
willing
conductor
able
only
up
to
a
point
.

So
we
had
some
dazzling
and
memorable
Milstein
,
but
not
great
Brahms
.

``
Parsifal
''
follows
July
25
,
with
Hans
Knappertsbusch
conducting
,
and
he
also
conducts
``
Die
Meistersinger
''
,
to
be
presented
Aug.
8
and
12
.

Remember
how
by
lack
of
two
big
theaters
Chicago
missed
the
first
visit
of
the
Royal
Danish
Ballet
?
?

The
engagement
was
supposed
to
be
all
set
for
the
big
theater
in
McCormick
Place
,
which
Sol
Hurok
,
ballet
booker
extraordinary
,
considers
the
finest
house
of
its
kind
in
the
country
--
and
of
course
he
doesn't
weep
at
the
capacity
,
either
.

Allied
Arts
Corporation
first
listed
the
Chicago
dates
as
Dec.
4
thru

Something
had
to
give
.

The
Kirov
Ballet
is
firmly
booked
into
the
Shrine
Auditorium
,
Los
Angeles
,
Nov.
21
thru
Dec.

.

It's
all
up
in
the
air

.

An
exhibition
of
Evelyn
Cibula's
paintings
will
open
with
a
reception
Nov.
5
at
the
Evanston
Community
center
,
828
Davis
St.
.

It
is
one
of
the
most
entertaining
and
irresponsible
novels
of
the
season
.

They
want
to
own
a
junior-grade
castle
,
or
a
manor
house
,
or
some
modest
little
place
where
Shakespeare
might
once
have
staged
a
pageant
for
Great
Elizabeth
and
all
her
bearded
courtiers
.

It's
a
horror
.

He
suggests
that
Gore
Court
embodies
all
the
glories
of
Tudor
splendor
.

The
stained-glass
windows
may
have
developed
unpremeditated
patinas
,
the
paneling
may
be
no
more
durable
than
the
planks
in
a
political
platform
.

The
spaciousness
of
the
Tudor
cooking
areas
,
for
example
,
will
provide
needed
space
for
the
extra
television
sets
required
by
modern
butlers
,
cooks
and
maids

He
is
willing
to
sell
it
just
to
get
it
off
his
hands
.

They
plan
to
become
county
people
who
know
the
proper
way
to
terminate
a
fox's
life
on
earth
.

After
Larkin
has
been
persuaded
to
restock
his
tangled
acres
with
pheasants
,
he
poaches
only
what
he
needs
for
the
nourishment
of
his
family
and
local
callers
.

More
than
a
beautiful
visualization
of
the
illustrious
adventures
and
escapades
of
the
tragi-comic
knight-errant
and
his
squire
,
Sancho
Panza
,
in
seventeenth-century
Spain
,
this
inevitably
abbreviated
rendering
of
the
classic
satire
on
chivalry
is
an
affectingly
warm
and
human
exposition
of
character
.

He
treats
this
deep-eyed
,
bearded
,
bony
crackpot
with
tangible
affection
and
respect
.

As
a
matter
of
fact
,
this
latter
approach
has
already
been
tried
,
and
with
pleasing
results
.

An
enthusiastic
audience
confirmed
the
``
live
''
character
of
the
hour
,
and
provided
the
interaction
between
musician
and
hearer
which
almost
always
seems
to
improve
the
quality
of
performance
.

In
an
hour
remembered
for
its
almost
rudderless
movement
,
a
score
of
jazz
luminaries
went
before
the
cameras
for
lengthy
periods
.

(
He
played
host
at
the
Timex
show
already
mentioned
.

What
followed
the
outburst
brought
almost
breathless
silence
as
Miss
Sutherland
revealed
her
mastery
of
a
voice
probably
unique
among
sopranos
today
.

Nervousness
at
the
start
must
have
caused
the
blemishes
of
her
first
scene
,
or
she
may
warm
up
slowly
.

Technically
it
was
fascinating
,
aurally
spell-binding
,
and
dramatically
quite
realistic
.

He
injected
more
vitality
into
the
score
than
it
has
revealed
in
many
years
.

It's
really
quite
fun
--
as
long
as
you
like
games
.

There
are
12
of
these
to
choose
from
,
all
of
them
of
popular
music

for
the
star
release

Pass
In
Review
(

)
.

Some
clue
to
the
character
of
London's
approach
in
these
discs
may
be
gained
immediately
from
the
fact
that
ten
of
the
12
titles
include
the
word
``
percussion
''
or
``
percussive
''
.

During
the
making
recently
of
an
important
Biblical
film
,
some
40
volumes
of
research
material
and
sketches
not
only
of
costumes
and
interiors
,
but
of
architectural
developments
,
sports
arenas
,
vehicles
,
and
other
paraphernalia
were
compiled
,
consulted
,
and
complied
with
.

Earlier
this
month
Edward
R.
Murrow
,
director
of
the
United
States
Information
Agency
,
came
to
Hollywood
and
had
dinner
with
more
than
100
leaders
of
the
motion
picture
industry
.

He
intimated
that
they
weren't
doing
the
country
much
good
in
the
Cold
War
.

Yet
for
much
of
the
globe
,
Hollywood
is
just
that
--
prime
,
if
not
sole
,
source
of
knowledge
.

Francois
D'Albert
,
Hungarian-born
violinist
who
made
his
New
York
debut
three
years
ago
,
played
a
return
engagement
last
night
in
Judson
Hall
.

His
pianist
was
Donald
Jenni
,
a
faculty
member
at
DePaul
University
.

The
work's
two
movements
,
one
melodically
sentimental
,
the
other
brightly
capricious
,
are
clever
enough
in
a
Ravel-like
style
,
but
they
rehash
a
wornout
idiom
.

Miss
Xydis
has
a
natural
affinity
for
the
keyboard
,
and
in
the
twenty
years
since
her
debut
here
she
has
gained
the
authority
and
inner
assurance
that
lead
to
audience
control
.

The
Rachmaninoff
Prelude
No.
12
,
Op.
32
,
for
instance
,
gave
her
an
opportunity
to
exploit
one
of
her
special
facilities
--
the
ability
to
produce
fine
deep-sounding
bass
tones
while
contrasting
them
simultaneously
with
fine
silver
filagree
in
the
treble
.

Haydn's
Sonata
in
E
minor
,
which
was
unfailingly
pleasant
in
sound
,
and
Chopin's
Sonata
in
B
flat
minor
.

All
the
generals
who
held
important
commands
in
World
War
2
,
did
not
write
books
.

It
only
seems
as
if
they
did
.

One
of
the
very
best
is
only
now
published
in
this
country
,
five
years
after
its
first
publication
in
England
.

Field
Marshal
Slim
has
abridged
it
for
the
benefit
of
``
those
who
,
finding
not
so
great
an
attraction
in
accounts
of
military
moves
and
counter-moves
,
are
more
interested
in
men
and
their
reactions
to
stress
,
hardship
and
danger
''
.

Parts
of
``
Defeat
Into
Victory
''
are
a
tangle
of
Burmese
place
names
and
military
units
,
but
a
little
application
makes
everything
clear
enough
.

On
the
whole
this
is
an
interesting
and
exceptionally
well-written
book
.

Before
he
could
return
to
Burma
,
Field
Marshal
Slim
had
to
rally
the
defeated
remnants
of
a
discouraged
army
and
unite
them
with
fresh
recruits
.

He
believed
in
making
inspiring
speeches
and
he
made
a
great
many
.

For
general
morale
reasons
and
to
encourage
the
efforts
of
his
supply
officers
,
when
food
was
short
for
combat
troops
he
cut
the
rations
of
his
headquarters
staff
accordingly
.

Other
crucial
matters
required
constant
supervision
:
labor
and
all
noncombatant
troops
,
whose
morale
was
vital
,
too
;
;

airdrops
and
airstrips
;
;

roads
and
river
barges
to
be
built
.

Expected
of
a
commander

``
When
in
doubt
as
to
two
courses
of
action
,
a
general
should
choose
the
bolder
''
.

It
depresses
them
.

The
Latin
,
for
example
,
was
not
only
clear
;
;

Lines
came
out
neatly
and
in
good
balance
.

Not
that
it
is
all
funny
,
by
any
means
,
though
some
of
it
is
definitely
so
,
but
simply
that
the
dancers
are
young
and
handsome
,
high-spirited
and
communicative
,
and
the
program
itself
is
as
vivacious
as
it
is
varied
.

But
under
the
direction
of
Mira
Ziminska-Sygietynska
,
who
with
her
late
husband
founded
the
organization
in
1948
,
it
has
all
been
put
into
theatrical
form
,
treated
selectively
,
choreographed
specifically
for
presentation
to
spectators
,
and
performed
altogether
professionally
.

the
mazurka
choreographed
by
Witold
Zapala
to
music
from
Moniuszko's
opera
,
``
Strasny
Dwor'
,
may
be
the
most
beautiful
mazurka
you
are
likely
ever
to
see
;
;

there
is
an
enchanting
polonaise
;
;

settings
by
William
David
Roberts
.

The
story
is
of
a
famous
strip
cartoonist
,
an
arty
individual
,
whose
specialty
is
the
American
boy
and
who
adopts
a
10-year-old
to
provide
him
with
fresh
idea
material
.

This
is
when
his
troubles
begin
,
not
to
mention
a
fledgling
artist
who
he
hires
,
and
who
turns
out
to
have
ideas
of
his
own
,
with
particular
respect
to
the
hero's
sweetheart-secretary
.

He
does
,
and
more
.

The
Newport
Playhouse
presents
``
Epitaph
For
George
Dillon
''
by
John
Osborne
and
Anthony
Creighton
,
directed
by
Wallace
Gray
.

He's
mad
at
a
world
he
did
not
make
.

By
the
end
of
the
third
act
,
the
artist
is
dead
but
the
body
lingers
on
,
a
shell
among
other
shells
.

Not
altogether
a
successful
play
,
``
Epitaph
For
George
Dillon
''
overcomes
through
sheer
vitality
and
power
what
in
a
lesser
work
might
be
crippling
.

Still
,
his
finale
is
put
together
with
taste
and
a
most
sensitive
projection
of
that
pale
sustenance
,
despair
.

Everybody
fell
in
love
with
Amy
again
last
night
at
the
Warwick
Musical
Theater
,
and
Shelley
Berman
was
to
blame
.

So
the
audience
last
night
was
all
ears
and
eyes
just
after
Act
2
,
got
a
rousing
opening
chorus
,
``
Where's
Charley
?
?

Sparrow-size
Virginia
Gibson
,
with
sparkling
blue
eyes
and
a
cheerful
smile
,
made
a
suitably
perky
Amy
,
while
Melisande
Congdon
,
as
the
real
aunt
,
was
positively
monumental
in
the
very
best
Gibson
Girl
manner
.

All
told
,
``
Where's
Charley
?
?

The
cast
:

''
Performed
in
New
York
by
the
original
cast
and
I
think
this
company
is
every
bit
as
good
,
and
perhaps
better
.

Such
fascinating
novelties
in
the
score
as
the
fugual
treatment
of
``
On
The
Side
Of
The
Angels
''
and
``
Politics
And
Poker
''
were
handled
splendidly
,
and
I
thought
Rudy
Bond
and
his
band
of
tuneful
ward-heelers
made
``
Little
Tin
Box
''
even
better
than
it
was
done
by
the
New
York
cast
;
;

The
party
at
Floyd's
penthouse
gave
the
``
chorines
''
a
chance
for
a
nostalgic
frolic
through
all
those
hackneyed
routines
which
have
become
a
classic
choreographic
statement
of
the
era's
nonsense
.

Martin
Tahse
has
established
quite
a
reputation
for
himself
as
a
successful
stager
of
touring
productions
.

I
must
say
,
however
,
that
I
preferred
the
acting
that
had
something
of
a
biting
edge
to
it
.

The
second
feature
,
``
The
Price
Of
Silence
''
,
is
a
British
detective
story
that
will
talk
your
head
off
.

His
famous
criticism
of
brother
Henry's
``
third
style
''
is
surely
as
subtly
,
even
elegantly
,
worded
an
analysis
of
the
latter's
intricate
air
castles
as
Henry
himself
could
ever
have
produced
.

``
The
best
condition
of
it
would
be
an
open
conflict
and
rivalry
of
the
diverse
systems
.

The
collected
works
of
James
Thurber
,
now
numbering
25
volumes
(
including
the
present
exhibit
)
represent
a
high
standard
of
literary
excellence
,
as
every
schoolboy
knows
.

A
semi-serious
literary
document
entitled
``
The
Wings
Of
Henry
James
''
is
noteworthy
,
if
only
for
a
keenly
trenchant
though
little-known
comment
on
the
master's
difficult
later
period
by
modest
Owen
Wister
,
author
of
``
The
Virginian
''
.

Or
the
mildly
epigrammatic
utterance
(
also
a
quotation
)
:
``
Woman's
place
is
in
the
wrong
''
.

Who
but
Thurber
can
be
counted
on
to
glean
such
nectareous
essences
?
?

A
tribute
to
midsummer
``
bang-sashes
''
seems
terribly
funny
,
though
it
would
be
hard
to
explain
why
.

'
I
thought
it
was
a
human
being
'
''
.

you
see
a
picture
--
trees
,
or
flowers
.

Though
no
longer
able
to
turn
out
his
protoplasmic
pen-and-ink
sketches
(
several
old
favorites
are
scattered
through
the
present
volume
)
Thurber
has
retained
unimpaired
his
vision
of
humor
as
a
thing
of
simple
,
unaffected
humanness
.

The
latest
Low
is
a
puzzler
.

He
is
at
his
usual
best
in
exposing
the
shams
and
self-deceptions
of
political
and
diplomatic
life
in
the
fifties
.

But
there
is
a
difference
between
the
present
volume
and
the
early
Low
.

But
this
argument
cannot
be
pushed
very
far
because
the
Communist
system
makes
up
for
any
shortcomings
of
its
leaders
in
respect
to
corrosion
.

In
the
thirties
we
would
not
face
our
enemy
;
;

Dulles
?
?

He
does
not
seem
to
have
caught
the
subtleties
of
the
man
.

and
the
eagle
,
who
leads
the
bird
community
when
he
is
not
too
busy
in
Washington
posing
for
fifty-cent
pieces
.

(
The
followers
of
bullies
invariably
are
aggrieved
about
the
very
things
they
plan
to
do
to
others
.

And
pretty
soon
gray
fox
is
announcing
that
he
won't
have
anyone
around
that's
against
him
,
and
setting
out
to
break
his
second
territorial
treaty
with
the
birds
.

In
substance
they
lie
somewhere
between
the
Southern
dialect
animal
stories
of
Joel
Chandler
Harris
(
Uncle
Remus
)
and
the
polished
,
witty
fables
of
James
Thurber
.

In
short
,
the
book
,
based
largely
on
lectures
delivered
at
Harvard
University
,
is
both
reliable
and
readable
;
;

Mr.
Kennan
sums
up
his
judgment
of
what
went
wrong
this
way
:

dashed
hope

Recognizing
that
there
could
have
been
no
effective
negotiated
peace
with
Hitler
,
he
points
out
the
shocking
failure
to
give
support
to
the
anti-Nazi
underground
,
which
very
nearly
eliminated
Hitler
in
1944
.

He
also
speaks
of
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt's
``
puerile
''
assumption
that
``
if
only
he
(
Stalin
)
could
be
exposed
to
the
persuasive
charm
of
someone
like
F.D.R.
himself
,
ideological
preconceptions
would
melt
and
Russia's
co-operation
with
the
West
could
be
easily
arranged
''
.

The
scope
and
significance
of
this
intervention
have
been
grossly
exaggerated
by
Communist
propaganda
;
;

a
man
whose
hand
was
set
against
all
that
could
not
be
useful
to
him
at
the
moment
;
;

''

Two
criticisms
of
this
generally
admirable
and
fascinating
book
involve
the
treatment
of
wartime
diplomacy
which
is
jagged
at
the
edges
--
there
is
no
mention
of
the
Potsdam
Conference
or
the
Morgenthau
Plan
.

In
``
Donnybrook
''
,
there
is
quite
a
different
Eire
,
a
rural
land
where
singing
,
dancing
,
fist-fighting
and
romancing
are
the
thing
.

By
and
large
,
Robert
McEnroe's
adaptation
of
Maurice
Walsh's
film
,
``
The
Quiet
Man
''
,
provides
the
entertainment
it
set
out
to
,
and
we
have
a
lively
musical
show
if
not
a
superlative
one
.

If
the
mettle
which
Ellen
exhibits
has
a
bit
of
theatrical
dross
in
it
,
never
mind
;
;

Susan
Johnson
,
as
the
widow
,
spends
the
first
half
of
the
play
running
a
bar
and
singing
about
the
unlamented
death
of
her
late
husband
and
the
second
half
trying
to
acquire
a
new
one
.

``
Donnybrook
''
is
no
``
Brigadoon
''
,
but
it
does
have
some
very
nice
romantic
background
touches
and
some
excellent
dancing
.

``
A
Toast
To
The
Bride
''
,
sung
by
Clarence
Nordstrom
,
playing
a
character
called
Old
Man
Toomey
,
is
quite
simple
,
direct
and
touching
.

So
is
that
of
the
limber
company
of
lasses
who
whirl
and
glide
and
quickstep
under
Jack
Cole's
expert
choreographic
direction
.

But
,
after
a
fifteen-minute
delay
,
the
substantially
complete
Philharmonic
assembled
on
stage
for
the
afternoon's
proceedings
.

It
was
an
excellent
concert
.

And
in
the
Prokofieff
C
major
Piano
Concerto
,
with
Zadel
Skolovsky
as
soloist
,
he
was
an
admirable
partner
.

But
granted
all
this
,
one
still
would
have
liked
to
have
heard
a
little
more
tonal
nuance
than
Mr.
Skolovsky
supplied
.

A
new
work
on
the
program
was
Nikolai
Lopatnikoff's
``
Festival
Overture
''
,
receiving
its
first
New
York
hearing
.

It
is
not
program
music
,
though
.

``
La
Gioconda
''
,
like
it
or
not
,
is
a
singer's
opera
.

So
the
plot
creaks
,
the
sets
are
decaying
,
the
costumes
are
pre-historic
,
the
orchestra
was
sloppy
and
not
very
well
connected
with
what
the
singers
were
doing
.

What
was
lacking
was
a
real
sense
of
phrase
,
the
kind
of
legato
singing
that
would
have
added
a
dimension
of
smoothness
to
what
is
,
after
all
,
a
very
oily
character
.

Regina
Resnik
as
Laura
and
Cesare
Siepi
as
Alvise
also
were
new
to
the
cast
,
but
only
with
respect
to
this
season
;
;

Mr.
Siepi
was
,
as
always
,
a
consummate
actor
;
;

It
also
makes
a
fine
introduction
to
the
international
art
form
with
good
examples
of
Italian
and
English
madrigals
plus
several
French
``
chansons
''
.

Claude
Jannequin's
vocal
description
of
a
battle
(
the
French
equivalents
of
tarantara
,
rum-tum-tum
,
and
boom-boom-boom
are
very
picturesque
)
is
lots
of
fun
,
and
the
singers
get
a
sense
of
grace
and
shape
into
other
chansons

Sonates
et
Concerts
Royaux
of
Couperin
Le
Grand
occupy
two
disks
(
LD056
and
LD060
)
and
reveal
the
impeccable
taste
and
workmanship
of
this
master
--
delicate
,
flexible
and
gemlike
.

The
Concerts
--
nos.
2
,
6
,
9
,
10
and
14
are
represented
--
are
really
closer
to
chamber
suites
than
to
concertos
in
the
Italian
sense
.

The
poor
uneducated
newlywed
,
a
certain
Gontran
De
Boismassif
,
has
his
problems
in
getting
the
necessary
information
.

The
simple
,
clever
production
was
also
able
to
tread
the
thin
line
between
those
extremes
.

I
make
this
observation
about
the
lady
,
Miss
Judy
Garland
,
because
she
brought
up
the
subject
herself
in
telling
a
story
about
a
British
female
reporter
who
flattered
her
terribly
in
London
recently
and
then
wrote
in
the
paper
the
next
day
:

``
Judy
Garland
has
arrived
in
London
.

In
her
first
song
she
waved
away
one
encroaching
photographer
who
dared
approach
the
throne
unbidden
and
thereafter
the
boys
with
the
cameras
had
to
unsheathe
their
300
mm.
lenses
and
shoot
at
extreme
range
.

There
also
came
a
brief
contretemps
with
the
sound
mixers
who
made
the
mistake
of
being
overheard
during
a
quiet
moment
near
the
conclusion
of
``
Do
It
Again
''
,
and
she
made
the
tart
observation
that
``
I
never
saw
so
much
moving
about
in
an
audience
''
.

Before
her
chore
was
finished
she
was
rescuing
wind-blown
sheets
of
music
,
trundling
microphones
about
the
stage
,
helping
to
move
the
piano
and
otherwise
joining
in
the
informal
atmosphere
.

And
time
after
time
she
really
belted
out
her
songs
.

All
went
home
happy
except
the
Newport
police
,
who
feared
that
the
throng
departing
at
6:35
might
meet
head-on
the
night
crowd
drawing
nigh
,
and
those
deprived
of
their
happy
hour
at
the
cocktail
bar
.

For
subtle
swinging
rhythms
,
I
could
admire
intensely
Mulligan's
version
of
``
Weep
''
,
and
the
fireworks
went
on
display
in
``
18
Carrots
For
Robert
''
,
a
sax
tribute
to
Johnny
Hodges
.

There
was
considerable
contrast
between
this
Mulligan
performance
and
that
of
Art
Blakey
and
The
Jazz
Messengers
,
who
are
able
to
generate
a
tremendous
sound
for
such
a
small
group
.

Unfortunately
,
Blakey
doesn't
choose
to
work
much
of
the
time
in
this
vein
.

Jazz
Three
open
program

The
evening
program
was
opened
by
the
Jazz
Three
,
a
Newport
group
consisting
of
Steve
Budieshein
on
bass
,
Jack
Warner
,
drums
,
and
Don
Cook
,
piano
.

it
prevents
late-comers
from
missing
some
of
the
people
they
have
come
a
long
way
to
hear
,
and
it
gives
the
resident
musicians
a
chance
to
perform
before
the
famous
Newport
audience
.

From
this
taste
of
the
1920s
,
we
leaped
way
out
to
Stan
Getz's
private
brand
of
progressive
jazz
,
which
did
lovely
,
subtle
things
for
``
Baubles
,
Bangles
And
Beads
''
,
and
a
couple
of
ballards
.

Divided
almost
equally
into
two
parts
,
it
consisted
of
``
The
Evolution
Of
The
Blues
''
,
narrated
by
Jon
Hendricks
,
who
had
presented
it
last
year
at
the
Monterey
,
Calif.
,
Jazz
Festival
,
and
an
hour-long
session
of
Maynard
Ferguson
and
his
orchestra
,
a
blasting
big
band
.

Tracing
the
blues
from
its
African
roots
among
the
slaves
who
were
brought
to
this
country
and
the
West
Indies
,
he
stressed
the
close
relationship
between
the
early
jazz
forms
and
the
music
of
the
Negro
churches
.

To
help
him
on
this
religious
aspect
of
primitive
jazz
he
had
``
Big
''
Miller
,
as
a
preacher-singer
and
Hannah
Dean
,
Gospel-singer
,
while
Oscar
Brown
Jr.
,
an
extremely
talented
young
man
,
did
a
slave
auctioneer's
call
,
a
field-hands'
work
song
,
and
a
beautifully
sung
Negro
lullaby
,
``
Brown
Baby
''
,
which
was
one
of
the
truly
moving
moments
of
the
festival
.

He
has
been
on
previous
Newport
programs
and
was
one
of
the
sensations
of
last
year's
afternoon
concerts
.

The
playing
takes
both
sides
of
the
disc
.

The
London
label
offers
an
operatic
recital
by
Ettore
Bastianini
,
a
baritone
whose
fame
is
international
.

this
urgent
visage
beckons
us
''
.

One
frequently
has
the
feeling
that
the
order
of
their
movement
combinations
could
be
transposed
without
notable
loss
of
effect
,
there
is
too
little
suggestion
of
organic
relationship
and
development
.

One
thing
is
certain
,
however
,
and
that
is
that
he
is
far
more
slavish
to
the
detailed
accents
,
phrasings
and
contours
of
the
music
he
deals
with
than
a
confident
dance
creator
need
be
.

'
an
American
journey
'

Eugene
Lester
assembled
a
witty
and
explicit
score
for
``
An
American
Journey
''
,
and
Malcolm
McCormick
gave
it
sprightly
imaginative
costumes
.

Mr.
Nagrin
has
described
four
``
places
''
,
each
with
its
scenery
and
people
,
added
two
``
diversions
''
,
and
concluded
with
``
A
Toccata
for
the
Young
''
,
a
refreshingly
underplayed
interpretation
of
rock'n'roll
dancing
.

Unfortunately
,
the
man
and
woman
were
not
made
to
appear
very
interesting
at
the
outset
and
the
menacing
figures
failed
to
make
them
any
more
so
.

The
details
of
the
suburban
concerts
next
season
,
and
the
centers
in
which
they
will
be
given
,
will
be
announced
later
,
Mr.
Toobin
said
.

The
concertos
that
Van
Cliburn
has
been
associated
with
in
New
York
since
his
triumphant
return
from
Russia
in
1958
have
been
the
Tchaikovsky
,
the
Rachmaninoff
Third
,
and
the
Prokofieff
Third
.

Deemed
too
static
when
it
was
first
heard
in
``
Lady
Be
Good
''
in
Philadelphia
in
1924
,
it
was
dropped
from
the
score
.

It
finally
reached
Broadway
in
the
second
and
successful
version
of
``
Strike
Up
The
Band
''
in
1929
.

If
one
of
Mr.
Rodgers'
melodies
seemed
to
deserve
a
better
fate
than
interment
in
Boston
or
the
obscurity
of
a
Broadway
failure
,
Mr.
Hart
was
likely
to
deck
it
out
with
new
lyrics
to
give
it
a
second
chance
in
another
show
.

The
melodies
flow
along
pleasantly
,
as
Mr.
Coward's
songs
usually
do
,
but
his
lyrics
have
a
tired
,
cut-to-a-familiar-pattern
quality
.

The
Artkino
presentation
,
with
English
titles
,
opened
on
Saturday
at
the
Cameo
Theatre
.

In
describing
the
initial
Allied
occupation
of
a
middle-sized
German
city
,
the
picture
has
color
,
pictorial
pull
and
genuinely
moving
moments
.

Under
Yakov
Segal's
direction
,
it
begins
stirringly
,
as
crouching
Soviet
and
Nazi
troops
silently
scan
each
other
,
waiting
for
the
first
surrender
gesture
.

How
Maxwell
recounts
his
first
coming
to
Camusfearna
,
his
furnishing
the
empty
house
with
beach-drift
,
the
subtle
changes
in
season
over
ten
years
,
is
a
moving
experience
.

This
reviewer
read
the
book
when
it
was
first
brought
out
in
England
with
a
sense
of
discovery
and
excitement
.

They
serve
to
contradict
a
popular
notion
that
the
Comedie
merely
repeats
,
as
accurately
as
possible
,
the
techniques
of
acting
the
classics
that
prevailed
in
the
17th
century
.

But
they
are
aware
of
the
world
outside
,
they
court
public
approval
,
they
delight
in
full
houses
,
and
they
occasionally
dare
to
experiment
in
interpreting
a
dramatic
classic
.

perhaps
that
is
the
Comedie's
equivalent
for
thrusting
this
play's
characters
into
our
own
time
.

I
say
``
apparently
''
although
I
saw
Jouvet
as
Arnolphe
when
he
visited
this
country
shortly
before
his
death
;
;

by
that
time
,
he
seemed
to
have
dropped
the
tragic
playing
of
the
last
moments
of
the
comedy
.

The
part
can
lend
itself
to
serious
treatment
;
;

one
influential
French
critic
remarked
:
``
Pity
for
Arnolphe
comes
with
age
''
.

Accordingly
,
at
the
Comedie
last
year
,
Jean
Meyer
played
a
sympathetic
Arnolphe
and
drew
criticism
for
turning
the
comedy
into
a
tragedy
.

Jouvet
played
him
as
a
sincere
zealot
,
and
Ledoux
,
at
the
Comedie
,
made
him
a
gross
buffoon
,
or
so
the
historians
tell
us
.

Occasionally
,
Seigner
draws
some
justly
deserved
laughs
by
his
quick
shifts
from
one
personality
to
another
.

The
whole
role
,
by
the
way
,
is
a
considerable
transformation
for
anyone
who
has
seen
Seigner
in
his
other
parts
.

We
are
often
told
that
the
Comedie
has
,
unfortunately
,
life-contracts
with
old
actors
who
are
both
mediocre
and
lazy
,
drawing
their
pay
without
much
acting
but
probably
doing
real
service
to
the
Comedie
by
staying
off
the
stage
.

To
begin
with
,
Scapin
is
a
trickster
in
the
old
tradition
of
the
clever
servant
who
plots
the
strategy
of
courtship
for
his
master
.

Hirsch's
Scapin
is
healthy
,
cheerful
,
energetic
,
revelling
in
his
physical
agility
and
his
obvious
superiority
to
the
young
gentlemen
whom
he
serves
.

And
surely
his
Scapin
has
a
fresh
directness
,
a
no-nonsense
quality
that
seems
to
make
him
his
own
master
and
nobody's
servant
.

And
Django
owed
much
to
Louis
Armstrong
.

It
was
the
first
jazz
he
had
heard
.

This
is
a
choice
item
and
Grappely
deserves
mention
too
,
of
course
.

Kid
Ory
,
the
trombonist
chicken
farmer
,
is
also
one
of
the
solid
anchor
points
of
jazz
.

The
set
contains
``
High
Society
''
,
``
Do
What
Ory
Say
''
,
``
Down
Home
Rag
''
,
``
Careless
Love
''
,
Jazz
Me
Blues
''
,
``
Weary
Blues
''
,
``

,
``

``

,

''
,
``

''
,
``
Eh
,
La

''
,
``

''
,
and
``

''
.

The
occasion
was
sentimental
;
;

We
have
Alfredo
Antonini
to
thank
for
this
healthy
change
of
diet
as
well
as
the
lively
performances
of
the
Stadium
Symphony
.

Since
an
objective
viewer
might
well
conclude
that
this
is
not
a
situation
that
would
often
arise
,
the
film's
extensive
discussion
of
the
problem
seems
,
at
best
,
superfluous
.

With
Julie
London
enacting
the
central
role
with
husky-voiced
sincerity
,
the
longsuffering
heroine
is
at
least
attractive
.

And
why
do
we
in
the
West
know
so
few
of
his
ballets
?
?

The
middle
section
of
the
program
was
made
up
of
short
numbers
,
naturally
enough
of
unequal
merit
,
but
all
of
them
pretty
good
at
that
.

a
stirring
``
Flames
Of
Paris
''
pas
de
deux
by
Xenia
Ter-Stepanova
and
Alexandre
Pavlovsky
,
and
a
lovely
version
of
Fokine's
``
Le
Cygne
''
by
Olga
Moiseyeva
,
which
had
to
be
repeated
.

A
year
ago
today
,
when
the
Democrats
were
fretting
and
frolicking
in
Los
Angeles
and
John
F.
Kennedy
was
still
only
an
able
and
ambitious
Senator
who
yearned
for
the
power
and
responsibility
of
the
Presidency
,
Theodore
H.
White
had
already
compiled
masses
of
notes
about
the
Presidential
campaign
of
1960
.

This
is
a
remarkable
book
and
an
astonishingly
interesting
one
.

As
a
dramatic
narrative
``
The
Making
Of
The
President
1960
''
is
continuously
engrossing
.

He
then
switches
back
to
a
consideration
of
the
seven
principal
Presidential
hopefuls
:
five
Democrats
--
Senator
Hubert
H.
Humphrey
,
Senator
Stuart
Symington
,
Senator
Lyndon
B.
Johnson
,
Adlai
E.
Stevenson
and
Mr.
Kennedy
--
and
two
Republicans
--
Governor
Rockefeller
and
Mr.
Nixon
.

Calm
,
dignified
,
composed
,
``
superbly
eloquent
''
,
Mr.
Kennedy
always
knew
everything
about
everybody
.

But
to
operate
in
American
politics
one
must
go
a
step
further
--
one
must
build
a
bridge
to
such
names
,
establish
a
warmth
,
a
personal
connection
''
.

In
all
fairness
,
there
were
flashes
of
the
great
stylist
of
yesteryear
,
flashes
even
of
the
old
consummate
vocalism
.

One
such
moment
came
in
the
breathtaking
way
Miss
Pons
sang
the
cadenza
to
Meyerbeer's
``
Shadow
Song
''
.

The
years
suddenly
fell
away
at
this
point
.

But
the
growing
number
of
Negro-appeal
radio
stations
,
plus
evidence
of
strong
listener
support
of
their
advertisers
,
give
time
salesmen
an
impressive
argument
as
they
approach
new
prospects
.

At
least
60
stations
devote
all
of
their
time
to
reaching
this
audience
in
about
half
of
the
50
states
.

These
and
other
figures
and
comments
have
been
reported
in
a
special
supplement
of
Sponsor
magazine
,
a
trade
publication
for
radio
and
TV
advertisers
.

For
10
years
Sponsor
has
issued
an
annual
survey
of
the
size
and
characteristics
of
the
Negro
market
and
of
successful
techniques
for
reaching
this
market
through
radio
.

It
also
brought
home
proof
of
something
a
casual
observer
might
have
missed
:
that
more
than
half
of
the
U.S.
Negroes
live
outside
the
southeastern
states
.

Also
,
the
state
with
the
largest
number
of
Negroes
is
New
York
--
not
in
the
South
at
all
.

And
WWRL's
colorful
mobile
unit
,
cruising
predominately
Negro
neighborhoods
,
is
a
frequent
reminder
of
that
station's
round-the-clock
dedication
to
nonwhite
interests
.

The
Keystone
Broadcasting
System's
Negro
network
includes
360
affiliated
stations
,
whose
signals
reach
more
than
half
the
total
U.S.
Negro
population
.

Whatever
the
long-range
impact
of
integration
,
the
owners
of
Negro-appeal
radio
stations
these
days
know
they
have
an
audience
and
that
it
is
loyal
.

Sponsor
quotes
John
McLendon
of
the
McLendon-Ebony
station
group
as
saying
that
the
Southern
Negro
is
becoming
conscious
of
quality
and
``
does
not
wish
to
be
associated
with
radio
which
is
any
way
degrading
to
his
race
;
;

It
will
continue
to
be
important
as
a
means
of
orientation
to
the
Negro
,
seeking
to
become
urbanized
,
as
he
tries
to
make
adjustment
to
the
urban
life
.

Presentation
of
``
The
Life
And
Times
Of
John
Sloan
''
in
the
Delaware
Art
Center
here
suggests
a
current
nostalgia
for
human
values
in
art
.

Staged
by
way
of
announcing
the
gift
of
a
large
and
intimate
Sloan
collection
by
the
artist's
widow
,
Helen
Farr
Sloan
,
to
the
Wilmington
Society
of
the
Fine
Arts
,
the
exhibition
presents
a
survey
of
Sloan's
work
.

Few
artists
have
left
a
life
work
so
eloquent
of
the
period
in
which
they
lived
.

Few
who
have
painted
the
scenes
around
them
have
done
so
with
so
little
bitterness
.

The
paintings
,
drawings
,
prints
,
and
illustrations
all
reflect
the
manners
,
costumes
,
and
mores
of
America
in
the
first
half
of
the
present
century
.

The
solidity
of
brush
stroke
yielded
to
a
hatching
technique
that
finally
led
to
virtual
abandonment
of
American
genres
in
favor
of
single
figure
studies
and
studio
nudes
.

Sloan
created
such
works
for
newspaper
supplements
before
syndication
threw
him
out
of
a
job
and
sent
him
to
roam
the
streets
of
New
York
,
thereby
building
for
America
an
incomparable
city
survey
from
paintings
of
McSorley's
Saloon
to
breezy
clotheslines
on
city
roofs
.

Significant
are
such
canvases
as
``
Bleeker
Street
,
Saturday
Night
''
,
with
its
typically
American
crowd
(
Sloan
never
went
abroad
)
;
;

The
fact
that
Sloan
was
an
extrovert
,
concerned
primarily
with
what
he
saw
,
adds
greatly
to
the
value
of
his
art
as
a
human
chronicle
.

The
32
C
Minor
Variations
with
which
he
opened
moved
fluently
yet
logically
from
one
to
another
,
leaving
the
right
impression
of
abundance
under
discipline
.

But
he
weighted
the
Eighth
Symphony
,
at
times
,
with
a
shuddering
subjectivity
which
seemed
considerably
at
odds
with
the
music
.

Everybody
returned
after
intermission
for
the
miscellaneous
sweepings
of
the
Fantasy
For
Piano
,
Chorus
,
And
Orchestra
In
C
Minor
,
made
up
by
its
composer
to
fill
out
one
of
his
programs
.

A
tribe
in
ancient
India
believed
the
earth
was
a
huge
tea
tray
resting
on
the
backs
of
three
giant
elephants
,
which
in
turn
stood
on
the
shell
of
a
great
tortoise
.

This
theory
eventually
proved
inexact
.

First
of
all
,
and
this
has
been
calculated
by
observation
,
the
universe
is
expanding
--
that
is
,
the
galaxies
are
receding
from
each
other
at
immense
speeds
.

Then
,
after
many
more
billions
of
years
,
when
all
the
galaxies
are
whistling
toward
a
common
center
,
this
movement
will
slow
down
and
reverse
itself
again
.

For
new
galaxies
to
be
created
,
Professor
Bondi
declares
,
it
would
only
be
necessary
for
a
single
hydrogen
atom
to
be
created
in
an
area
the
size
of
your
living
room
once
every
few
million
years
.

Dr.
Lyttleton
backs
the
theory
that
we
live
in
an
electric
universe
and
this
theory
starts
with
the
behavior
of
protons
and
electrons
.

Now
if
one
hydrogen
atom
were
placed
at
the
surface
of
a
large
sphere
of
hydrogen
atoms
,
it
would
be
subject
both
to
the
gravitation
of
the
sphere
and
the
charge-excess
of
all
those
atoms
in
the
sphere
.

This
,
he
claims
,
would
reasonably
account
for
the
expansion
of
the
universe
.

This
slim
book
,
while
giving
the
reader
only
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
the
scientific
mind
confronting
the
universe
,
has
the
appeal
that
informed
conversation
always
has
.

Several
photographs
and
charts
of
galaxies
help
the
non-scientist
keep
up
with
the
discussion
,
and
the
smooth
language
indicates
the
contributors
were
determined
to
avoid
the
jargon
that
seems
to
work
its
way
into
almost
every
field
.

Presently
,
the
intense
absorption
of
ultra-violet
rays
in
the
earth's
atmosphere
seriously
hinders
ground
observation
.

``
Roots
''
,
the
new
play
at
the
brand-new
Mayfair
Theater
on
46th
St.
which
has
been
made
over
from
a
night
club
,
is
about
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
awakening
of
an
English
farm
girl
.

Beatie
,
getting
no
sympathy
for
her
misfortune
,
soon
rallies
and
finds
that
although
she
has
lost
a
lover
she
has
gained
her
freedom
.

Joseph
Papp
,
impassioned
founder
of
the
festival
and
director
of
``
Much
Ado
''
,
had
a
vibrant
,
colorful
production
under
way
.

Using
a
wide
stage
resourcefully
he
mingled
music
and
dance
with
Shakespeare's
words
in
a
spirited
mixture
.

The
barbed
sallies
of
Beatrice
and
Benedick
,
so
contemporary
to
a
public
inured
to
the
humor
of
insult
,
raised
chuckles
.

At
first
hardly
a
person
in
the
audience
moved
,
although
some
umbrellas
were
opened
.

A
voice
on
the
loudspeaker
system
announced
that
if
the
rain
let
up
the
performance
would
resume
in
ten
minutes
.

The
Parks
Department
has
done
an
admirable
job
of
preparing
the
Wollman
Rink
for
Shakespeare
.

Mr.
Papp
has
directed
a
performance
that
has
verve
and
pace
,
although
he
has
tolerated
obvious
business
to
garner
easy
laughs
where
elegance
and
consistency
of
style
would
be
preferable
.

For
style
and
assurance
,
for
a
supreme
and
regal
bearing
there
is
still
no
one
who
can
touch
her
.

The
symptoms
Saturday
night
were
unmistakable
.

Miss
Schwarzkopf
is
too
great
an
artist
to
need
them
.

Among
the
other
solo
ballet
dancers
of
the
evening
,
Elisabeth
Carroll
and
Ivan
Allen
were
particularly
impressive
in
their
roles
in
``
The
Duel
''
,
a
work
that
depends
so
much
upon
the
precision
and
incisiveness
of
the
two
principal
combatants
.

This
somewhat
cynical
comment
may
be
found
in
``
Blue
Skies
,
Brown
Studies
''
,
a
collection
of
travel
essays
by
William
Sansom
,
who
would
never
consider
staying
home
for
long
.

Mr.
Sansom
is
English
,
bearded
,
formidably
cultivated
,
the
versatile
author
of
numerous
volumes
of
short
stories
,
of
novels
and
of
pieces
that
are
neither
short
stories
nor
travel
articles
but
something
midway
between
.

There
are
sixteen
essays
in
``

``
I

``
Beneath
any
feeling
he
has
of
the
good
or
the
evil
of
the
world
lies
a
deeper
one
of
wonder
at
it
all
.

So
in
these
pages
one
can
share
his
wonder
at
the
traditional
fiesta
of
St.
Torpetius

still
persists
in

In
recent
days
there
have
been
extensive
lamentations
over
the
absence
of
original
drama
on
television
,
but
not
for
years
have
many
regretted
the
passing
of
new
plays
on
radio

Somewhere
in

is
both
protest

aspiration
of

American
composer

a
particular

.

It
is
commendable
that
a
regularly

is
set
aside
for
an
introduction
to
the
contemporary
musical
scene

the

Clerfayt
of
``
Heaven
Has
No
Favorites
''
resembles
Portago
only
in
that
he
is

race-driver

quite
a
bad
race-driver
,
whereas
Portago
was
a
good
one

One
looked
forward
to
Mr.
Remarque's
ninth
book
if
only
because
not
even
a
reasonably
good
novel
has
yet
been
written
grounded
on
automobile
racing
,
as
dramatic
a
sport
as
mankind
has
devised
.

Unhappily
,
``
Heaven
Has
No
Favorites
''
does
not
alter
the
record
except
to
add
one
more
bad
book
to
the
list
.

Mr.
Remarque's
conception
of
this
novel
was
sound
and
perhaps
even
noble
.

His
treatment
of
it
is
something
else
.

Between
the
first
meeting
of
Clerfayt
and
Lillian
and
this
dismal
denouement
,
Mr.
Remarque
has
laid
down
many
pages
of
junior-philosophical
discourse
,
some
demure
and
rather
fetching
love-making
,
pleasant
talk
about
some
of
the
countryside
and
restaurants
of
Europe
,
and
a
modicum
of
automobile
racing
.

the
love-making
,
perhaps
because
it
is
pale
and
low-key
when
one
has
been
conditioned
to
expect
harsh
colors
and
explicitness
,
is
often
charming

America

than

The
reasons

that

Montgomery

the
national
leaders
up
to

Whoever
rises
to
the
occasion
walks
a
treacherous

In
looking
as
far
back
as
Moses
,
thence
to
Cromwell
,
Napoleon
,
Lincoln
,
Churchill
,
and
Nehru
,
Montgomery
attempts
to
trace
the
stirrings
and
qualities
of
great
men
.

It
is
a
kind
of
justice
,
too
,
that
it
should
originate
in
London's
Royal
Albert
Hall
,
where
,
traditionally
,
the
loudest
,
if
not
the
greatest
,

have
entertained

To
eat
is
human
,
the
nation
is
learning
to
think
,
to
survive
divine
.

Grocery
stores
sell
dozens
of
foods
that
boast
of
having
almost
no
food
value
at
all
.

The
man
most
firmly
at
grips
with
the
problem
is
the
University
of
Minnesota's
Physiologist
Ancel
Keys
,
57
,
inventor
of
the
wartime
K
(
for
Keys
)
ration
and
author
of
last
year's
bestselling
Eat
Well
And
Stay
Well
.

He
has
measured
the
skinfolds
(
the
fleshy
areas
under
the
shoulder
blades
)
of
Neapolitan
firemen
,
studied
the
metabolism
of
Finnish
woodcutters
,
analyzed
the
``
mealie-meal
''
eaten
by
Capetown
coloreds
,
and
experimented
on
Minneapolis
businessmen
.

Vitamins
,
eggs
and
milk
begin
to
look
like
foods
to
hold
down
on
(
though
mothers'
milk
is
still
the
ticket
)
.

Morals
aside
,
the
fat
man
has
plenty
to
worry
about
--
over
and
above
the
fact
that
no
one
any
longer
loves
him
.

The
fat
man
has
trouble
buying
life
insurance
or
has
to
pay
higher
premiums
.

He
is
particularly
vulnerable
to
diabetes
.

Physical
exercise
raises
the
appestat

Food
for
frustration
.

It
may
be
fostered
by
frustration
,
depression
,
insecurity
--
or
,
in
children
,
simply
by
the
desire
to
stop
an
anxious
mother's
nagging
.

He
may
be
interested
in
another
woman
,
or
just
like
being
with
the
boys
.

So

fishes

But
they
cannot
fully
explain
the
process
of
its
manufacture
by
the
human
liver
.

Ordinarily
,
the
human
liver
synthesizes
only
enough
cholesterol
to
satisfy
the
body's
needs
--
for
transportation
of
fats
and
for
production
of
bile
.

But
fatty
foods
do
.

Mono-unsaturated
fats
have
room
for
two
more
hydrogens
on
each
molecule
,
and
the
poly-unsaturated
fat
molecule
has
room
for
at
least
four
hydrogens
.

For
in
the
modern
world
neither
``
spirit
''
nor
``
matter
''
refer
to
any
generally
agreed-upon
elements
of
experience
.

When
the
words
are
used
,
we
are
never
sure
which
of
the
traditional
meanings
the
user
may
have
in
mind
,
or
to
what
extent
his
revisions
and
rejections
of
former
understandings
correspond
to
ours
.

Not
only
in
popular
thought
but
in
that
of
the
highly
educated
as
well
was
this
true
.

As
the
play
opens
the
audience
is
introduced
to
the
community
of
Salem
in
Puritan
America
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
.

There
is
no
occasion
to
feel
uneasy
or
disturbed
about
these
people
.

A
teenage
girl
,
Abigail
Williams
,
is
being
sharply
questioned
by
her
minister
uncle
,
the
Reverend
Samuel
Parris
,
about
a
wild
night
affair
in
the
woods
in
which
she
and
some
other
girls
had
seemed
to
have
had
contact
with
these
evil
beings
.

For
all
involved
in
this
discussion
the
devil
is
a
real
entity
who
can
really
be
confronted
in
the
woods
on
a
dark
night
,
the
demon
world
is
populated
with
real
creatures
,
and
witches
actually
can
be
seen
flying
through
the
air
.

I
hear
the
boot
of
Lucifer
,
I
see
his
filthy
face
''
!
!

And
his
belief
is
not
to
his
discredit
.

Every
community
,
if
it
is
alive
has
a
spirit
,
and
that
spirit
is
the
center
of
its
unity
and
identity
.

For
it
is
primarily
in
community
that
we
know
and
experience
spirit
.

One
characteristic
of
the
spirit
in
community
is
its
givenness
.

On
the
contrary
,
even
in
the
heart
of
``
the
Bible
belt
''
itself
,
as
can
be
attested
by
any
one
who
is
called
to
work
there
,
the
industrial
and
technological
revolutions
have
long
been
under
way
,
together
with
the
corresponding
changes
in
man's
picture
of
himself
and
his
world
.

In
fact
,
it
is
in
just
such
a
situation
that
the
profundity
of
Bultmann's
argument
is
disclosed
.

This
is
not
to
say
that
the
only
explanation
of
the
present
infatuation
with
Norman
Vincent
Peale's
``
cult
of
reassurance
''
or
the
other
types
of
a
purely
cultural
Christianity
is
the
ever-present
need
for
a
demythologized
gospel
.

and
those
of
us
who
so
richly
benefit
from
it
should
be
the
last
to
despise
it
.

In
any
event
,
it
is
an
irreversible
step
,
and
if
we
are
at
all
honest
with
ourselves
,
we
will
know
we
have
no
other
alternative
than
to
live
in
the
world
in
which
God
has
seen
fit
to
place
us
.

Finally
,
we
may
also
mention
the
several
members
of
the
self-consciously
``
neoliberal
''
movement
that
developed
at
the
University
of
Chicago
and
is
heavily
indebted
philosophically
to
the
creative
work
of
Alfred
North
Whitehead
.

What
makes
this
long
and
diverse
tradition
essentially
one
is
that
those
who
have
belonged
to
it
have
been
profoundly
in
earnest
about
being
modern
men
in
a
distinctively
modern
world
.

If
the
demand
for
demythologization
is
unavoidable
and
so
must
be
accepted
by
theology
unconditionally
,
the
position
of
the
``
right
''
is
clearly
untenable
.

Therefore
,
the
only
conceivable
alternatives
are
those
represented
,
on
the
one
hand
,
by
the
two
at
least
apparently
self-consistent
but
mutually
exclusive
positions
of
Buri
and
Barth
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
by
the
third
but
really
pseudo
position
(
analogous
to
a
round
square
)
of
Bultmann
.

It
will
be
recalled
from
the
discussion
in
Section
7
that
the
position
of
the
``
right
''
,
as
represented
by
Barth
,
rests
on
the
following
thesis
:
The
only
tenable
alternative
to
Bultmann's
position
is
a
theology
that
(
1
)
rejects
or
at
least
qualifies
his
unconditioned
demand
for
demythologization
and
existential
interpretation
;
;

and
(
3
)
in
so
doing
,
frees
itself
to
give
appropriate
emphasis
to
the
event
Jesus
Christ
by
means
of
statements
that
,
from
Bultmann's
point
of
view
,
are
mythological
.

but
my
primary
aim
is
to
transcribe
what
Englishmen
themselves
are
saying
and
writing
and
implying
about
the
Roman
and
Anglican
Churches
and
about
the
present
religious
state
of
England
.

On
my
first
Guy
Fawkes
Day
here
,
I
found
Catholics
as
well
as
non-Catholics
celebrating
with
the
traditional
fireworks
and
bonfires
,
and
was
told
that
most
Englishmen
either
do
not
know
or
are
not
concerned
with
the
historical
significance
of
the
day
.

The
article
proceeded
to
give
an
inaccurate
account
of
a
Catholic
plot
to
kill
King
James
1
.

In
1864
Newman
professedly
had
to
write
his
Apologia
with
his
keenest
feelings
in
order
to
be
believed
and
to
command
a
fair
hearing
from
English
readers
.

A
Catholic
priest
recently
recounted
how
in
the
chapel
of
a
large
city
university
,
following
Anglican
evensong
,
at
which
there
was
a
congregation
of
twelve
,
he
celebrated
Mass
before
more
than
a
hundred
.

It
should
be
admitted
,
too
,
that
there
is
a
good
percentage
of
lapsed
or
nonchurchgoing
Catholics
(
one
paper
writes
50
per
cent
)
.

Still
,
it
is
clear
from
such
reports
,
and
apparently
clear
from
the
remarks
of
many
people
,
that
Protestants
are
decreasing
and
Catholics
increasing
.

That
day
is
perhaps
today
,
1961
,
and
it
seems
no
longer
very
meaningful
to
call
England
a
``
Protestant
country
''
.

Many
English
Catholics
are
proud
of
their
Catholicism
and
know
that
they
are
in
a
new
ascendancy
.

I
have
found
myself
saying
with
other
foreigners
here
that
English
Catholics
are
good
Catholics
.

Now
,
not
only
are
there
considerably
more
laity
as
students
and
professors
at
Oxford
,
but
there
are
also
numerous
houses
of
religious
orders
existing
in
respectable
and
friendly
relations
with
the
non-Catholic
members
of
the
University
.

Catholic
seminarians
attend
tutorials
and
row
on
the
Cherwell
with
non-Catholic
students
.

On
successive
Sundays
during
October
,
1960
,
Paul
Ferris
(
a
non-Catholic
)
wrote
articles
in
the
Observer
depicting
clergymen
of
the
Church
of
England
,
the
Church
of
Rome
and
the
Nonconformist
Church
.

It
was
the
first
time
an
English
Primate
has
done
this
since
the
14th
century
.

Almost
daily
something
is
reported
which
feeds
this
Catholic
hope
in
England
:
statistics
of
the
increasing
numbers
of
converts
and
Irish
Catholic
immigrants
;
;

a
report
that
200
Protestant
clergymen
and
laity
attended
a
votive
Mass
offered
for
Christian
unity
at
a
Catholic
church
in
Slough
during
the
Church
Unity
Octave
.

Christianity
declares
that
in
the
life
and
death
of
Jesus
Christ
the
unique
and
the
universal
concur
.

His
death
is
his
alone
,
yet
each
man
can
see
his
own
death
in
the
crucifixion
of
Jesus
.

for
a
spiral
has
motion
as
well
as
recurrence
.

Irenaeus
does
not
regard
Adam
and
Eve
merely
as
private
individuals
,
but
as
universal
human
beings
,
who
were
and
are
all
of
humanity
.

in
the
similitude
of
God
he
created
him
''
.

the
similitude
of
God
,
by
contrast
,
is
that
which
makes
a
man
a
child
of
God
and
not
merely
a
rational
creature
.

He
does
not
mean
to
say
that
Adam
lost
the
similitude
of
God
and
his
immortality
through
the
fall
;
;

for
she
did
not
obey
when
as
yet
she
was
a
virgin
.

His
interpretation
of
the
beginning
on
the
basis
of
the
end
prompts
him
to
draw
these
parallels
between
the
Virgin
Eve
and
the
Virgin
Mary
.

That
parallelism
affects
his
picture
of
man's
disobedience
too
;
;

At
the
nadir
of
that
circuit
is
death
.

``
Wherefore
also
He
(
God
)
drove
him
(
man
)
out
of
Paradise
,
and
removed
him
far
from
the
tree
of
life
,
not
because
He
envied
him
the
tree
of
life
,
as
some
venture
to
assert
,
but
because
He
pitied
him
,
(
and
did
not
desire
)
that
he
should
continue
a
sinner
for
ever
,
nor
that
the
sin
which
surrounded
him
should
be
immortal
,
and
evil
interminable
and
irremediable
.

It
is
borne
out
also
by
the
absence
of
any
developed
theory
about
how
sin
passes
from
one
generation
to
the
next
.

This
emphasis
upon
death
rather
than
sin
as
man's
fundamental
problem
Irenaeus
shares
with
many
early
theologians
,
especially
the
Greek-speaking
ones
.

These
two
aspects
of
death
cannot
be
successfully
separated
,
but
they
dare
not
be
confused
or
identified
.

The
embarrassment
of
these
theories
over
the
naturalness
of
death
is
an
illustration
of
the
thesis
that
death
cannot
be
only
a
punishment
,
for
some
termination
seems
necessary
in
a
life
that
is
lived
within
the
natural
order
of
time
and
change
.

It
is
the
wages
of
sin
,
and
its
sting
is
the
law
.

This
seems
to
have
been
the
conclusion
to
which
Origen
was
forced
.

Even
so
,
Gannett
judiciously
argued
,
the
Association
could
legitimately
decide
that
Parker
``
should
not
be
encouraged
nor
assisted
in
diffusing
his
opinions
by
those
who
differ
from
him
in
regard
to
their
correctness
''
.

We
today
are
not
entitled
to
excoriate
honest
men
who
believed
Parker
to
be
downright
pernicious
and
who
barred
their
pulpits
against
his
demand
to
poison
the
minds
of
their
congregations
.

the
difference
between
Mr.
Parker
and
the
Association
is
a
difference
between
no
Christianity
and
Christianity
''
--
despite
these
supposed
conclusive
assurances
,
the
modern
liberal
heaves
repeatedly
a
sigh
of
relief
,
of
positive
thanksgiving
,
that
the
Association
never
quite
brought
itself
officially
to
expel
Parker
.

Had
it
done
so
,
the
blot
on
its
escutcheon
would
have
remained
indelible
,
nor
could
the
Harvard
Divinity
School
assemble
today
to
honor
Parker's
insurgence
other
than
by
getting
down
on
its
collective
knees
and
crying
``
peccavi
''
.

Parker
was
never
excommunicated
.

Is
it
after
all
possible
that
no
matter
how
the
liberals
trumpet
their
confidence
in
human
dignity
they
are
exposed
to
a
contagion
of
fear
more
insidious
than
any
conservative
has
ever
to
worry
about
?
?

Parker
insisted
upon
not
resigning
,
even
when
the
majority
wanted
him
to
depart
,
upon
daring
the
Fellowship
to
throw
him
out
.

It
cannot
be
smoothed
over
by
now
cherishing
his
sarcasms
as
delightful
bits
of
self-deprecation
or
by
solemnly
calling
for
a
reconsideration
of
the
justice
of
the
objections
to
him
.

Even
though
his
theological
theses
have
become
,
to
us
,
commonplaces
,
the
fundamental
interrogation
he
phrased
is
very
much
with
us
.

The
gentle
Channing
,
revered
by
all
Bostonians
,
orthodox
or
Unitarian
,
wrote
to
a
friend
in
Louisville
that
among
its
many
virtues
Boston
did
not
abound
in
a
tolerant
spirit
,
that
the
yoke
of
opinion
crushed
individuality
of
judgment
and
action
:
``
No
city
in
the
world
is
governed
so
little
by
a
police
,
and
so
much
by
mutual
inspections
and
what
is
called
public
sentiment
.

He
arraigned
the
citizens
in
language
of
so
little
courtesy
that
they
had
to
respond
with
,
at
the
least
,
resentment
.

You
and
I
do
the
same
thing
.

So
we
are
the
more
prepared
to
give
Parker
the
credit
for
having
taken
the
right
side
in
an
unnecessary
controversy
,
to
salute
his
courage
,
and
to
pass
on
,
happily
forgetting
both
him
and
the
entire
episode
.

We
have
not
the
leisure
,
or
the
patience
,
or
the
skill
,
to
comprehend
what
was
working
in
the
mind
and
heart
of
a
then
recent
graduate
from
the
Harvard
Divinity
School
who
would
muster
the
audacity
to
contradict
his
most
formidable
instructor
,
the
majesterial
Andrews
Norton
,
by
saying
that
,
while
he
believed
Jesus
``
like
other
religious
teachers
''
,
worked
miracles
,
``
I
see
not
how
a
miracle
proves
a
doctrine
''
.

At
one
time
I
became
disturbed
in
the
faith
in
which
I
had
grown
up
by
the
apparent
inroads
being
made
upon
both
Old
and
New
Testaments
by
a
``
Higher
Criticism
''
of
the
Bible
,
to
refute
which
I
felt
the
need
of
a
better
knowledge
of
Hebrew
and
of
archaeology
,
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
to
pull
out
some
of
the
props
of
our
faith
was
to
weaken
the
entire
structure
.

Although
still
aware
of
a
great
light
and
glow
of
warmth
in
the
Book
,
I
stood
outside
shivering
in
the
cold
.

In
one
thing
the
higher
critics
,
like
the
modernists
,
however
,
overreached
themselves
,
in
claiming
that
the
Gospel
of
John
was
not
written
in
John's
time
but
well
after
the
first
century
,
perhaps
as
late
as
150
A.D.
.

Now
,
if
any
part
of
the
Bible
is
assuredly
the
very
Word
of
God
speaking
through
His
servant
,
it
is
John's
Gospel
.

As
a
short
,
possibly
not
the
best
method
,
I
looked
up
``
Word
''
in
the
Concordance
and
noted
that
the
Bible
claims
from
Genesis
1
to
Revelation
22
to
be
God's
personal
message
to
man
.

The
outcome
of
such
an
experiment
has
been
in
due
time
the
acceptance
of
the
Bible
as
the
Word
of
God
inspired
in
a
sense
utterly
different
from
any
merely
human
book
,
and
with
it
the
acceptance
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
as
the
only
begotten
Son
of
God
,
Son
of
Man
by
the
Virgin
Mary
,
the
Saviour
of
the
world
.

The
Bible
is
as
obviously
and
truly
food
for
the
spirit
as
bread
is
food
for
the
body
.

In
his
heart
he
had
that
peace
of
which
the
Lord
spoke
when
He
said
,
``
Peace
I
leave
with
you
,
my
peace
I
give
unto
you
:
not
as
the
world
giveth
,
give
I
unto
you
.

How
often
have
I
looked
to
Jesus
when
entering
the
sick
room
,
asking
for
His
presence
and
help
in
my
professional
duties
as
I
give
my
talents
not
only
as
the
world
giveth
but
as
one
who
loves
the
Saviour
and
His
creatures
.

Looking
unto
God
,
the
Prophet
Isaiah
wrote
these
blessed
words
almost
three
thousand
years
ago
:
``
Thou
wilt
keep
him
in
perfect
peace
,
whose
mind
is
stayed
on
thee
:
because
he
trusteth
in
thee
''
.

Perhaps
you
do
not
know
if
you
belong
to
Him
.

Proof
?
?

One
out
of
every
three
or
four
marriages
ends
in
divorce
!
!

(
Mark
36
,
37
)
.

Is
putting
a
rocket
in
orbit
half
so
significant
as
the
good
news
that
God
put
His
Son
,
Jesus
Christ
,
on
earth
to
live
and
die
to
save
our
hell-bound
souls
?
?

``
For
God
so
loved
the
world
,
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
Son
,
that
whosoever
believeth
in
Him
should
not
perish
,
but
have
everlasting
life
''
(
John
3
:
:

Is
forgiveness
of
past
sins
,
assurance
of
present
help
,
and
hope
of
future
bliss
in
your
orbit
?
?

Or
are
you
trying
the
devil's
substitutes
to
relieve
that
spiritual
hunger
you
feel
within
?
?

``
The
Lord
is
my
light
and
my
salvation
;
;

They
are
'
worry
warts
.

One
doctor
made
a
careful
survey
of
his
patients
and
the
reasons
for
their
troubles
,
and
he
reported
that
40%
of
them
worried
about
things
that
never
happened
;
;

12%
of
them
worried
about
their
health
,
although
their
ailments
were
imaginary
;
;

What
is
the
real
cause
of
them
?
?

Meanwhile
,
the
enemy
will
capitalize
on
our
fears
,
if
he
can
.

Hitler
did
just
that
23
years
ago
,
building
up
tensions
that
first
led
to
a
Munich
and
then
to
a
world
war
.

And
that's
another
reason
why
it
is
imperative
for
us
these
days
to
conquer
our
fears
,
to
develop
the
poise
that
promotes
peace
.

Turning
to
the
Word
of
God
,
we
find
the
only
sure
way
to
do
that
.

In
Psalm
27
:
1
you
read
those
beautiful
words
which
you
must
have
in
your
heart
if
you
are
to
master
the
fears
that
surround
you
,
or
to
drive
them
out
if
they
have
you
in
their
grip
:
``
The
Lord
is
my
light
and
my
salvation
;
;

The
Lord
is
the
strength
of
my
life
;
;

Though
an
host
should
encamp
against
me
,
my
heart
shall
not
fear
:
though
war
should
rise
against
me
,
in
this
will
I
be
confident
''
.

Our
enemy
is
also
threatening
to
devour
us
.

of
whom
shall
I
be
afraid
''
?
?

--
those
were
His
very
first
creative
words
--
He
began
the
world
with
light
--
this
God
still
gives
light
to
a
world
which
man
has
plunged
into
darkness
.

We
live
in
the
bright
daylight
of
that
great
event
;
;

This
is
the
faith
that
moved
the
psalmist
to
add
his
second
conception
of
God
:
``
The
Lord
is
my
salvation
''
.

He
knew
that
his
God
would
save
him
from
his
enemies
because
He
had
saved
him
from
his
sins
.

Shall
tribulation
,
or
distress
,
or
persecution
,
or
famine
,
or
nakedness
,
or
peril
,
or
sword
''
?
?

The
``
Lo
Shu
''
square
as
an
expression
of
centrality

However

books
were
also
destroyed
in
a
series
of
Orthodox
Confucian
purges
which
culminated
in
a
final
proscription
in
605
.

But
,
up
to
now
,
no
one
has
attempted
to
analyze
its
inherent
mathematical
properties
,
or
the
numerical
significance
of
its
numbers
--
singly
or
in
combination
--
and
then
tried
to
consider
these
in
the
light
of
Old
Chinese
cosmological
concepts
.

The
importance
of
this
5
can
largely
be
explained
by
the
natural
mathematical
properties
of
the
middle
number
and
its
special
relationship
to
all
the
rest
of
the
numbers
--
quite
apart
from
any
numerological
considerations
,
which
is
to
say
,
any
symbolic
meaning
arbitrarily
assigned
to
it
.

Indeed
,
mathematically
speaking
,
it
was
both
functionally
and
symbolically
the
most
important
number
in
the
entire
diagram
.

and
the
latter
is
the
total
sum
of
all
the
numbers
in
the
square
,
by
which
all
the
other
numbers
are
overshadowed
and
in
which
they
may
be
said
to
be
absorbed
.

After
this
time
,
inscriptions
on
the
Han
bronze
mirrors
,
as
well
as
other
writings
,
emphasized
the
desirability
of
keeping
one's
self
at
the
center
of
the
universe

where
cosmic
forces

strongest

Reception
into
the
Church
Fellowship

This
is
a
vital
part
of
their
spiritual
growth
and
assimilation
.

members
to

Every
member

place
in

life
.

Yet
the
most
difficult
problem
in
the
Church's
program
of
evangelism
is
right
at
this
point
--
helping
new
members
to
become
participating
,
growing
parts
of
the
fellowship
.

Something
is
wrong
when
these
things
happen
.

The
local
``
family
of
God
''
has
failed
its
new
members
through
neglect
and
unconcern
for
their
spiritual
welfare
.

It
must
be
planned
and
carefully
developed
.

When
they
unite
with
the
Church
they
must
find
in
this
fellowship
the
satisfaction
of
their
basic
spiritual
needs
or
they
will
never
mature
into
effective
Christians
.

Creative

.

The
source
of
this
paradox
is
not
difficult
to
identify
.

Approached
creatively
,
it
is
a
high
art
.

Some
interfaith
tensions
are
not
occasioned
by
theological
differences
at
all
,
but
by
the
need
of
men
to
have
persons
they
can
blame
,
distrust
,
denounce
,
and
even
hate
.

Modern
psychology
has
shown
that
paralleling
``
the
authoritarian
personality
''
is
``
the
bigoted
personality
''
in
which
insecurity
,
inferiority
,
suspicion
,
and
distrust
combine
to
provide
a
target
for
antagonism
so
indispensable
that
it
will
be
manufactured
if
it
does
not
exist
naturally
.

To
some
extent
the
personal
inadequacies
that
prejudices
attempt
to
compensate
for
are
to
be
found
in
all
of
us
.

Actually
,
however
,
this
turns
out
to
be
only
part
of
the
picture
.

Nationalism
has
abetted
not
only
the
repudiation
of
foreign
religions
but
the
revival
of
native
ones
,
some
of
which
had
been
lying
in
slumber
for
centuries
.

But
the
problem
extends
elsewhere
.

The
progressive
closing
of
Afro-Asian
ears
to
the
Christian
message
is
epitomized
in
a
conversation
I
had
three
years
ago
while
flying
from
Jerusalem
to
Cairo
.

Ironically
,
these
are
the
groups
which
have
doubled
or
tripled
their
missionary
efforts
since
World
War
2
,
,
while
the
more
established
denominations
are
barely
maintaining
pre-war
staffs
.

neither
has
the
establishment
of
the
State
of
Israel
fostered
harmony
between
Muslims
and
Jews
.

I
turn
finally
to
several
theological
developments
.

1
.

The
modern
world
has
been
marked
by
progressive
disaffection
with
claims
to
divine
sanction
for
the
state
,
whatever
its
political
form
.

The
American
Constitution
was
historic
at
this
point
in
providing
that
``
Congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
''
.

During
the
years
when
Israel
was
passing
from
crisis
to
crisis
--
the
Sinai
campaign
,
the
infusion
of
multitudes
of
penniless
immigrants
--
it
was
felt
that
the
purpose
of
national
unity
could
be
best
served
if
the
secular
majority
were
to
yield
to
the
religious
parties
.

Now
that
Israel
enjoys
relative
prosperity
and
a
reduction
of
tensions
,
the
secularists
are
less
disposed
to
compromise
.

In
mentioning
this
under
``
salvation
reconsidered
''
I
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
Roman
Catholic
doctrine
has
changed
in
this
area
but
rather
that
it
has
become
clearer
to
the
world
community
what
that
doctrine
is
.

Yet
it
seems
clear
that
there
can
be
no
good
sufficiently
great
,
or
evil
repelled
sufficiently
grave
,
to
warrant
the
destruction
of
mankind
by
man's
own
action
.

This
is
what
,
in
a
technical
sense
,
to
``
only
permit
''
an
evil
result
means
.

Naturally
,
where
one
or
the
other
of
the
effects
of
an
action
is
uncertain
,
this
has
to
be
taken
into
account
.

He
does
not
expect
to
be
able
to
trammel
up
all
the
future
consequences
of
his
action
.

and
by
deriving
legitimate
decision
backward
from
whatever
may
conceivably
or
possibly
or
probably
result
,
whether
by
anyone's
doing
or
by
accident
,
it
finds
itself
driven
to
inaction
,
to
non-political
action
in
politics
and
non-military
action
in
military
affairs
,
and
to
the
not
very
surprising
discovery
that
there
are
now
no
distinctions
on
which
the
defense
of
justice
can
possibly
be
based
.

Thus
,
moral
decision
must
be
entirely
deduced
backward
from
the
likely
eventuality
;
;

Let
us
therefore
put
first
things
first
,
and
make
sure
of
preserving
the
human
race
at
whatever
the
temporary
price
may
be
''
.

On
their
way
to
the
Heavenly
City
the
children
of
God
make
use
of
the
pax-ordo
of
the
earthly
city
and
acknowledge
their
share
in
responsibility
for
its
preservation
.

Not
to
repel
injury
and
uphold
and
improve
pax-ordo
means
not
simply
to
accept
the
misshapen
order
and
injustice
that
challenges
it
at
the
moment
,
but
also
to
start
down
the
steep
slope
along
which
justice
can
find
no
place
whereon
to
stand
.

Would
such
an
act
of
refusal
be
useful
?
?

The
only
contrary
action
,
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
,
runs
the
risk
of
war
;
;

We
should
not
allow
the
image
of
an
immanent
end
brought
about
indirectly
by
our
own
action
in
the
continuing
human
struggle
for
a
just
endurable
order
of
existence
to
blind
us
to
the
fact
that
in
some
measure
accelerating
the
end
of
our
lease
may
be
one
consequence
among
others
of
many
other
of
mankind's
thrusts
toward
we
know
not
what
future
.

Professional
responsibility
is
seen
to
consist
largely
in
serving
the
wishes
of
the
client
fairly
and
in
an
efficient
manner
.

Obviously
what
we
are
confronted
with
here
is
the
identification
of
``
professional
''
with
narrow
skills
and
specialization
,
the
effective
servicing
of
a
client
,
rather
than
responsiveness
to
the
wider
and
deeper
meaning
and
associations
of
one's
work
.

Realtors
live
in
their
communities
as
specialists
in
a
given
area
of
work
,
as
members
of
social
and
professional
organizations
,
as
citizens
and
civic
leaders
,
as
church
laymen
,
as
university
alumni
,
as
newspaper
readers
,
etc.
.

It
seems
to
us
that
choices
exercised
by
realtors
in
moral
situations
center
in
at
least
three
areas
:
(
1
)
the
various
ways
in
which
they
interpret
a
particular
social
issue
;
;

Discussion
of
minority
housing
necessarily
involves
such
basic
issues
as
the
intensity
of
one's
democratic
conviction
and
religious
belief
concerning
equality
of
opportunity
,
the
function
and
limitations
of
government
in
the
securing
of
such
equality
,
and
the
spotlight
that
world
opinion
plays
upon
local
incidents
of
racial
agitation
and
strife
.

Realtors
in
attendance
at
the
colloquium
expressed
interest
,
for
example
,
in
Connecticut's
new
housing
law
as
setting
standards
of
equity
that
they
would
like
``
to
have
to
obey
''
,
but
in
support
of
which
none
had
been
willing
to
go
on
public
record
.

Official
reasoning
:
the
bill
was
a
``
wanton
invasion
of
basic
property
rights
''
.

the
attitude
adopted
by
realtors
and
their
associations
,
either
negative
or
positive
,
plays
a
large
part
in
the
public
acceptance
of
such
measures
and
the
degree
to
which
they
may
be
effectively
enforced
.

But
as
yet
,
no
real
estate
board
has
been
willing
officially
to
support
such
laws
or
to
admit
the
permissibility
of
introducing
minority
buyers
into
all-white
neighborhoods
.

Such
judgments
are
meaningful
only
in
so
far
as
persons
are
members
of
a
world
,
let
us
say
a
community
,
that
embraces
Scarsdale
or
Yonkers
,
but
is
also
infinitely
richer
since
it
is
all-inclusive
.

That
community
of
all
creation
is
,
then
,
the
ultimate
object
of
our
loyalty
and
the
concrete
norm
of
all
moral
judgment
.

A
fragmented
Society

Our
faculty
and
students
pressed
this
issue
more
than
any
other
.

Religion
,
or
the
lack
of
it
,
will
decide
whether
we
use
this
power
to
build
a
brave
new
world
of
peace
and
abundance
for
all
mankind
,
or
whether
we
misuse
this
power
to
leave
a
world
utterly
destroyed
.

We
are
looking
inside
the
atom
and
seeing
there
a
universe
which
is
not
material
but
something
beyond
the
material
,
a
universe
that
in
a
word
is
not
matter
but
music
.

That
is
enough
TNT
to
fill
the
tower
of
the
Empire
State
Building
;
;

and
with
the
availability
of
bombs
of
that
size
,
war
became
a
new
problem
.

But
we
had
hardly
started
to
adjust
our
thinking
to
this
new
uranium
weapon
when
we
were
faced
with
the
hydrogen
bomb
.

water
is
Af
and
the
H
stands
for
hydrogen
;
;

I
have
calculated
that
if
I
could
snap
my
fingers
in
one
magic
gesture
to
release
the
power
of
all
the
hydrogen
in
my
body
,
I
would
explode
with
the
force
of
a
hundred
bombs
of
the
kind
that
fell
on
Hiroshima
.

And
think
,
if
we
all
knew
this
secret
and
we
could
pool
our
power
,
what
a
wonderful
public
utility
company
we
would
make
.

a
trillion
peas
would
fill
all
the
houses
in
a
town
of
about
ten
thousand
people
;
;

I
saw
that
I
would
soon
run
out
of
buildings
at
this
rate
,
so
I
decided
to
take
another
measure
--
the
whole
state
of
Pennsylvania
.

So
you
see
how
small
an
atom
is
and
how
complicated
you
are
.

A
speck
--
and
space

I
start
growing
rapidly
and
this
calcium
atom
grows
along
with
me
.

Even
if
the
atom
were
big
enough
to
hold
a
football
field
,
this
nucleus
is
still
only
about
the
size
of
a
pinhead
.

For
we
believed
that
the
electrons
obeyed
the
law
of
mechanics
and
electrodynamics
;
;

So
if
you
are
made
of
atoms
,
you
are
just
a
big
machine
;
;

And
this
would
mean
that
we
live
in
a
mechanistic
universe
,
governed
by
the
laws
of
cause
and
effect
,
bound
in
chains
of
determinism
that
hold
the
universe
on
a
completely
predetermined
course
in
which
there
is
not
room
for
soul
or
spirit
or
human
freedom
.

and
as
this
music
ebbs
and
flows
,
there
is
an
antiphonal
chorus
from
all
the
atoms
outside
,
in
fact
from
the
atoms
of
the
entire
universe
.

Some
of
the
Island
is
sand
and
is
not
suitable
for
living
.

the
rest
is
obtained
from
harbor
scallops
.

Many
of
them
had
once
been
members
of
a
church
or
at
least
had
been
given
instruction
in
Christianity
but
for
one
or
another
reason
had
allowed
the
connexion
to
lapse
.

For
instance
,
we
cannot
know
whether
even
for
church
members
the
degree
of
conformity
to
Christian
standards
of
morality
increased
or
declined
as
the
proportion
of
church
members
in
the
population
rose
.

Yet
this
cannot
be
proved
.

As
church
membership
burgeoned
,
such
measures
faded
into
desuetude
.

But
whether
this
was
accompanied
by
a
general
lowering
of
the
moral
life
of
the
membership
we
do
not
know
.

We
have
already
hinted
at
the
fashion
in
which
Christianity
contributed
to
education
and
so
to
intellectual
life
.

Throughout
the
nineteenth
century
Christianity
exerted
its
influence
on
American
society
as
a
whole
primarily
through
the
Protestantism
of
the
older
stock
.

In
the
twentieth
century
its
influence
grew
,
as
did
that
of
the
Protestantism
of
the
nineteenth-century
immigration
.

The
American
dream

The
ideals
of
the
country
were
deeply
indebted
to
the
Protestantism
of
the
older
stock
.

Some
were
clearly
of
Christian
origin
,
among
them
the
Great
Awakening
and
other
revivals
which
helped
to
make
Christian
liberty
,
Christian
equality
,
and
Christian
fraternity
the
passion
of
the
land
.

We
must
also
remember
those
who
reacted
against
the
dream
as
a
kind
of
myth
--
among
them
Melville
,
Hawthorne
,
and
Henry
James
the
elder
,
all
of
them
out
of
a
Christian
background
.

We
do
well
to
remind
ourselves
that
from
men
and
women
of
New
England
ancestry
also
issued
the
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latter
Day
Saints
,
the
Seventh
Day
Adventists
,
Christian
Science
,
the
American
Board
of
Commissioners
for
Foreign
Missions
,
the
American
Home
Missionary
Society
,
the
American
Bible
Society
,
and
New
England
theology
.

Some
disappeared
with
the
attainment
of
their
purpose
.

As
we
have
seen
,
Methodism
early
took
a
stand
against
slavery
.

Beginning
at
least
as
far
back
as
1789
various
Baptist
bodies
condemned
slavery
.

The
nineteenth-century
immigration
,
whether
Protestant
or
Roman
Catholic
,
was
not
so
much
concerned
,
for
very
few
if
any
among
them
held
slaves
:
they
were
mostly
in
the
Northern
states
where
slavery
had
disappeared
or
was
on
the
way
out
,
or
were
too
poverty-stricken
to
own
slaves
.

The
anti-slavery
movement
took
many
forms
.

It
was
he
who
turned
the
attention
of
William
Lloyd
Garrison
(
1805-1879
)
to
the
subject
.

They
and
others
employed
some
of
Finney's
techniques
as
they
sought
to
win
adherents
to
the
cause
.

He
was
remembered
chiefly
for
his
fearless
advocacy
of
abolition
,
but
he
also
stood
for
equal
rights
for
women
,
for
opportunity
for
the
freedmen
,
and
for
prohibition
.

Proper
ritual
observance
at
any
level
of
society
was
capable
of
generating
power
for
use
in
the
spirit
world
;
;

This
is
the
familiar
system
of
``
cosmic
government
''
.

If
the
moral
code
were
flouted
,
the
proper
balance
of
the
universe
would
be
upset
,
and
the
disastrous
result
could
be
floods
,
plague
,
or
famine
.

Living
in
urban
conditions
,
away
from
the
deadweight
of
village
constraint
and
the
constrictions
of
a
thatched-roof
world
view
,
the
individual
may
find
it
possible
,
say
,
to
commit
adultery
not
only
without
personal
misgivings
,
but
also
without
suffering
any
adverse
effects
in
his
worldly
fortunes
.

Nonmagical
Confucianism
was
a
secular
,
rational
philosophy
,
but
even
with
this
different
orientation
it
could
not
escape
from
the
ethos
of
a
cosmic
government
.

Confucianism
had
its
own
magic
in
the
idea
that
virtue
had
power
.

this
was
not
virtue
as
we
understand
the
word
today
,
and
it
did
not
mean
an
abandonment
of
the
belief
in
magic
manipulation
.

To
the
Confucian
,
``
virtue
''
simply
meant
mastery
and
correct
observance
of
three
hundred
major
rules
of
ritual
and
three
thousand
minor
ones
.

So
,
too
,
was
the
insistence
on
the
relativity
of
the
external
world
,
and
the
ideas
that
language
and
things
perceived
by
consciousness
were
poor
substitutes
indeed
for
immediate
perception
by
pure
,
indwelling
spirit
:
the
opposition
of
pure
consciousness
to
ratiocinating
consciousness
.

In
support
of
this
,
stories
from
the
early
literature
are
cited
to
show
that
Zen
attacks
the
idea
of
supernatural
power
.

Modern
Zen
presentation
to
the
West
insists
on
the
anti-authoritarian
,
highly
pragmatic
nature
of
the
Zen
belief
--
scriptures
are
burned
to
make
fire
,
action
is
based
on
direct
self-confidence
,
and
so
on
.

This
picture
of
extreme
self-reliant
individuation
is
difficult
to
reconcile
with
such
Zendo
formulas
as
:
``
O
you
,
demons
and
other
spiritual
beings
,
I
now
offer
this
to
you
,
and
may
this
food
fill
up
the
ten
quarters
of
the
world
and
all
the
demons
and
other
spiritual
beings
be
fed
therewith
.

Pope
Pius
the
Sixth
,
at
Rome
,
in
April
,
1778
,
wrote
the
following
:
``
The
faithful
should
be
excited
to
the
reading
of
the
Holy
Scriptures
:
For
these
are
the
most
abundant
sources
which
ought
to
be
left
open
to
everyone
,
to
draw
from
them
purity
of
morals
and
of
doctrine
,
to
eradicate
errors
which
are
so
widely
disseminated
in
these
corrupt
times
''

The

All

Evidences
of
the
new
birth

Everyone
who
believes
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
is
born
of
God
.

As
many
as
received
him
were
born
of
God
.

St.
John
12
,
13
.

If
we
are
born
of
God
we
do
not
practice
sin
as
a
habit
.

)
if
we
are
born
of
god
we
practice
righteousness
.

If
we
are
born
of
God
we
overcome
the
world
.

All
that
is
born
of
God
overcomes
the
world
;
;

If
we
are
born
of
God
we
grow
in
(
not
into
,
but
in
)
grace
.

But
grow
in
grace
and
knowledge
of
our
Lord
and
Savior
,
Jesus
Christ
.

2
St.
Peter
18
.

Jesus
answered
and
said
to
him
(
Nicodemus
)
``
Amen
,
amen
,
I
say
to
thee
,
unless
a
man
be
born
again
,
he
cannot
see
the
kingdom
of
God
''
.

Do
not
wonder
that
I
said
to
thee
,
'
You
must
be
born
again
'
''
.

For
in
Christ
Jesus
neither
circumcision
nor
uncircumcision
but
a
new
creation
is
of
any
account

But
to
as

as
received

gave
the
power

becoming

were

not

nor
of

God

you
may
be
baptized

confirmed

reverent

you
may
have
the
final
and

unction

if
you
are

again
you
are
lost

headed
for
hell

punishment

You
cannot
be
saved

;

It

permitted

They
called
Him
a
devil

God
withheld
His
wrath

You
can
ignore
His
Book
,
the

and
His
church
.

You
may
take
His
name
upon
your
lips
in
oaths
and
curses
if
you
so
choose
.

He
has
said
,
``
Behold
,
I
stand
at
the
door
,
and
knock
:
if
any
man
hear
my
voice
,
and
open
the
door

I
will
come
in
to
him

and
will
sup
with
him

he
with
me

(
Revelation
3:20
:
:

The
choice
is
up
to
you
.

The
choice
is
yours
:
God
is
in
your
hands
,
now
.

God
has
already
set
the
day
when
you
will
be
in
His
hands
.

Then
it
will
be
a
``
fearful
thing
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
living
God
''
if
you
have
abused
Him
in
your
hands
.

That
purpose
has
never
changed
.

I
am
not
doing
anything
,
of
myself
.

I
am
merely
a
channel
for
something
.

I
cannot
define
it
fully
.

It
is
the
power
that
holds
the
stars
in
their
orbits
,
but
allows
the
wind
to
bend

grass
.

All
things
are
possible
to
God
,
but
He
chooses
--
usually
--
to
work
through
people
.

Sometimes
such
people
sense
that
they
are
being
used

The
people
who
told

stories
were
sincere

``
You're
not

,

told
my
discouraged
people

And
the
100,000
subscribers
became
a
reality

And
then
500,000
.

With
our
growth
came
expansion
into
new
fields
of
service

Rumors
flew
from
lip
to
lip
that
Fidel
Castro
was
on
his
way
to
Havana
,
coming
from
the
mountains
where
he
had
fought
Batista
for
five
years
.

yet
if
you
looked
closely
you'd
see
that
his
eyes
did
not
pick
up
the
smile
on
his
lips
.

Diario
De
La
Marina
was
the
oldest
and
most
influential
paper
in
Cuba
,
with
a
reputation
for
speaking
out
against
tyranny
.

When
it
was
my
turn
,
I
,
too
,
printed
the
truth
as
I
knew
it
about
Batista
,
and
rejoiced
to
see
his
regime
topple
.

None
of
us
was
aware
that
the
biggest
fight
was
still
ahead
.

He
spent
long
hours
before
the
TV
spitting
out
promises
of
revenge
.

He
showed
us
how
he
dealt
with
his
enemies
:
he
executed
them
before
TV
cameras
.

On
home
sets
children
were
watching
the
death
throes
of
men
who
were
shot
before
the
paredon
,
the
firing
wall
.

He
seemed
bent
on
coupling
them
with
vengeance
.

He
had
promised
cheaper
housing
:
arbitrarily
he
cut
all
rents
in
half
,
whether
the
landlord
was
a
millionaire
speculator
or
a
widow
whose
only
income
was
the
rental
of
a
spare
room
.

Here
was
a
powerful
,
ready-made
medium
,
but
it
could
speak
only
if
I
told
it
to
.

You
may
lose

Far
from
discouraging

on

Jean-Paul
Senesac
,
whose
story
appeared
here
two
issues
ago
;
;

Yesiree
,
the
professor
knows
his
muscles
!
!

That's
when
he
went
to
Professor
Claude
.

As
you
can
see
,
in
this
Push-Pull
Super
Set
the
entire
chest-back-shoulder
area
is
vigorously
exercised
in
alternate
sectors
by
alternate
exercises
so
the
complete
torso
remains
pumped-up
all
the
time
!
!

In
the
third
Push-Pull
Super-Set
the
``
push
''
exercise
is
the
widegrip
Pushup
Between
Bars
,
while
the
``
pull
''
exercise
is
the
Moon
Bench
Lateral
Raise
with
bent
arms
.

This
is
true
only
if
a
very
wide
grip
is
used
and
only
when
the
greatest
possible
stretch
is
achieved
.

He
has
Henri
do
from
four
to
six
sets
of
the
Incline
Bench
Press
(
note
the
high
incline
)
.

This
gives
a
wide
flare
to
the
pecs
,
causing
them
to
flow
dramatically
upward
into
deltoids
and
dramatically
downward
into
the
serratus
and
Aj
.

Rarer
still
is
a
Mr.
America
or
Mr.
Universe
of
true
Herculean
build
.

The
aspects
of
physical
development
that
catch
the
judges'
eyes
and
which
rightfully
influence
their
decisions
are
symmetry
and
that
hallmark
of
the
true
champion
--
superior
definition
of
the
muscles
.

But
contest
definition
--
that
dramatic
muscular
separation
of
every
muscle
group
that
seems
as
though
it
must
have
been
carved
by
a
sculptor's
chisel
--
is
something
quite
different
.

Definition
of
the
thighs
at
the
uppermost
part
is
quite
commonly
seen
in
most
championship
Olympic
lifters
which
is
easily
understandable
.

It
places
terrific
tension
on
the
leg
muscles
from
start
to
finish
of
each
repetition
.

It
improves
over-all
balance
and
control
for
the
bodybuilder
,
and
helps
to
make
Squats
more
easily
and
more
correctly
performed
.

5
.

It
speeds
muscle
growth
and
power
development
even
for
the
advanced
bodybuilder
because
each
hip
and
leg
is
exercised
separately
,
thus
enabling
a
massive
,
concentrated
effort
to
be
focused
on
each
.

Place
a
suitably-loaded
barbell
across
them
;
;

That's
the
One-Leg
Lunge
in
a
nutshell
.

You
should
have
a
couple
of
training
partners
to
stand
by
when
you
make
your
first
experiments
just
for
safety
.

Before
your
first
training
experiment
has
ended
there
will
be
a
big
improvement
and
almost
before
you
know
it
you'll
be
raising
and
lowering
yourself
just
like
a
veteran
!
!

The
more
I
talked
with
him
,
the
more
convinced
I
became
that
that
was
the
secret
of
their
riotous
blooming
.

These
specialists
,
I
learned
,
have
done
a
great
deal
of
work
to
improve
the
size
and
health
of
the
plants
and
the
resulting
flowers
.

It
isn't
easy
to
describe
it
,
but
every
gardener
knows
it
when
his
fingers
touch
such
soil
.

If
you
do
use
a
cold
frame
be
sure
that
its
ventilation
is
adequate
.

Ants
carry
away
the
seeds
so
better
be
sure
that
there
are
no
ant
hills
nearby
.

I
put
a
little
scoop
of
pulverized
phosphate
rock
or
steamed
bone
meal
into
each
hole
with
the
plant
.

Pansies
are
gluttons
.

We
put
a
light
mulch
over
the
seedlings
;
;

Three
inches
of
porous
material
will
do
a
good
job
of
keeping
weeds
down
and
the
soil
moist
and
cool
.

That
cold
frame
was
my
morale
builder
;
;

The
day
will
come
,
in
midsummer
,
when
you
find
your
plants
becoming
``
leggy
''
,
running
to
tall-growing
foliage
at
the
expense
of
blossoms
.

As
soon
as
an
experimental
tug
assures
you
that
roots
have
taken
over
,
cut
it
off
from
the
mother
plant
.

A
second
and
also
good
practice
is
to
shear
off
the
tops
,
leaving
an
inch
high
stub
with
just
a
leaf
or
two
on
each
branch
.

Nature's
aim
,
different
from
ours
,
is
to
provide
for
the
coming
generation
.

If
the
plants
are
cared
for
and
protected
over
the
winter
,
the
second
year
is
more
prolific
than
the
first
.

A
salad
with
greens
and
tomato
is
a
popular
and
wonderfully
healthful
addition
to
a
meal
,
but
add
an
avocado
and
you
have
something
really
special
.

It
is
a
flavor
that
might
take
a
little
getting
used
to
--
not
because
it
is
unpleasant
,
but
because
the
flavor
is
hard
to
define
in
the
light
of
our
experience
with
other
fruits
.

Sometimes
it
takes
several
``
eatings
''
of
avocado
to
catch
that
delightful
quality
in
taste
that
has
made
it
such
a
favorite
throughout
the
world
.

It
is
brought
to
packing
houses
,
cleaned
and
graded
as
to
size
and
quality
,
and
packed
in
protective
excelsior
.

If
the
temperature
is
controlled
properly
,
the
avocado
will
delay
its
ripening
until
needed
.

And
unlike
other
fruits
,
one
cannot
eat
the
skin
of
the
avocado
.

It
is
thick
,
much
like
an
egg
plant's
skin
,
so
that
poison
sprays
,
if
they
are
used
,
present
no
hazard
to
the
consumer
.

The
B
vitamins
are
well
represented
,
especially
thiamin
and
riboflavin
.

Five

With
a
nation
defenseless
before
it
,
why
would
the
attacker
spare
the
victim's
people
?
?

If
our
national
interest
lies
in
being
able
to
fight
and
win
a
war
rather
than
committing
national
suicide
,
then
we
must
take
a
much
more
penetrating
look
at
ballistic
missiles
.

Until
this
hunter-killer
operation
can
be
performed
by
spacecraft
,
manned
aircraft
appear
to
be
the
only
means
available
to
us
.

It
seems
reasonable
that
if
general
nuclear
war
is
not
to
be
one
cataclysmic
act
of
burning
each
other's
citizens
to
cinders
,
we
must
have
a
manned
strategic
force
of
long-endurance
aircraft
capable
of
going
into
China
or
Russia
to
find
and
destroy
their
strategic
forces
which
continued
to
threaten
us
.

The
aircraft
could
be
used
to
destroy
other
mobile
,
fleeting
,
and
imprecisely
located
targets
as
well
as
the
known
,
fixed
and
hardened
targets
which
can
also
be
destroyed
by
missile
.

Survivability
of
our
strategic
forces
(
Polaris
,
mobile
and
hardened
Minuteman
,
hardened
Atlas
and
Titan
,
and
airborne
Skybolt

means
that
it
will
take
some
time
,
perhaps
weeks
,
to
destroy
a
strategic
force
.

Forces
will
survive
a
surprise
attack
,
and
these
forces
will
give
depth
,
or
considerable
duration
,
to
the
conflict
.

But
until
we
have
an
effective
spacecraft
,
the
answer
to
the
hunter-killer
problem
is
manned
aircraft
.

If
we
could
use
all
the
small
airfields
we
have
in
this
country
,
we
could
disperse
our
strategic
aircraft
by
a
factor
of
10
or
more
.

We
could
put
a
portion
of
our
strategic
bombers
in
such
shelters
.

There
is
little
enthusiasm
for
spending
money
to
develop
more
powerful
engines
because
of
the
erroneous
belief
that
the
aircraft
has
been
made
obsolete
by
the
missile
.

One
seldom
hears
the
analogy
``
nuclear
propulsion
will
do
for
the
aircraft
what
it
has
already
done
for
the
submarine
''
.

With
powerplants
such
as
these
,
vertical
takeoff
and
landing
combat
aircraft
could
be
built
.

With
a
15-to-one
engine
,
a
supersonic
aircraft
weighing
300,000
pounds
could
rise
vertically
.

These
crucial
questions
must
be
answered
by
post-attack
reconnaissance
.

Even
if
this
is
some
day
possible
,
there
remains
the
30-minute
time
of
flight
of
a
missile
to
its
overseas
target
.

It
could
operate
under
the
clouds
and
perform
infrared
photography
through
clouds
and
at
night
.

Since
it
requires
only
five
players
,
it
would
seem
to
fall
into
the
category
of
chamber
music
--
yet
it
calls
for
a
double
bass
,
an
instrument
generally
regarded
as
symphonic
.

Schnabel's
emphasis
on
structural
clarity
,
his
innate
rhythmic
vibrancy
,
and
impetuous
intensity
all
tend
to
stamp
his
reading
as
a
symphonic
one
.

There
is
a
break
in
continuity
just
before
the
fourth
variation
in
the
``
Forellen
''
movement
,
and
I
suspect
that
this
is
due
to
imperfect
splicing
between
sides
of
the
original
Aj
.

(
Special
compliments
to
the
double
bass
playing
of
Johann
Krumpp
:
his
scrawny
,
tottering
sound
adds
a
delightful
hilarity
to
the
performance
.

Since
the
concept
of
high
fidelity
became
important
some
dozen
years
ago
,
the
claims
of
technical
improvements
have
multiplied
tenfold
.

Any
alteration
of
one
of
these
factors
is
distortion
,
although
we
generally
use
that
word
only
for
effects
so
pronounced
that
they
can
be
stated
quantitatively
on
the
basis
of
standard
tests
.

The
sound
may
be
good
;
;

The
easiest
way
to
describe
this
release
is
to
say
that
it
reproduces
an
interesting
and
effective
Steinberg
performance
with
minimal
alteration
of
its
musical
values
.

Yet
you
feel
the
orchestra
is
near
at
hand
,
and
the
individual
instruments
have
the
same
firm
presence
associated
with
listening
from
a
good
seat
in
an
acoustically
perfect
hall
.

The
music
is
always
allowed
the
living
space
needed
to
attain
its
full
sonority
;
;

The
Presto
Ma
non
assai
of
the
first
trio
of
the
scherzo
is
taken
literally
and
may
shock
you
,
as
the
real
Allegro
con
Spirito
of
the
finale
is
likely
to
bring
you
to
your
feet
.

Steinberg
obviously
has
concluded
that
it
is
the
lyric
element
which
must
dominate
in
this
score
,
and
he
manages
at
times
to
create
the
effect
of
the
whole
orchestra
bursting
into
song
.

Dogs
have
a
way
of
sensing
our
feelings
!
!

When
you
and
your
dog
step
into
the
Junior
ring
,
it
should
be
just
what
the
dog
wants
to
do
as
much
as
what
you
want
him
to
do
.

``
The
reason
you
are
in
the
ring
today
is
to
show
your
ability
to
present
to
any
judge
the
most
attractive
picture
of
your
dog
that
the
skillful
use
of
your
aids
can
produce

feels
very
forcibly
that
the
American
Kennel
Club
should
take
a
more
active
part
in
encouraging
the

Before
the
Juniors
entered
the
ring
the
Steward
announced
that
after
all
Juniors
had
moved

set
them
up

they
could
relax

Judging
class
for
intermediates
proposed

It
has
been
suggested
many
times
that
a
Class
be
set
up
for
the
Juniors
who
are
overage
and
cannot
enter
the
Junior
Classes
.

For
some
time
this
writer
has
been
suggesting
a
Junior
Judging
Class
for
Intermediates
over
16
and
under
20
years
of
age
who
are
ineligible
to
compete
in
the
Junior
Class
.

If
the
superintendents
do
not
receive
more
cooperation
from
Handlers
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
licensed
Judges
also
be
qualified
to
judge
this
Class
.

By
recognizing
and
helping
Juniors
get
interested
in
the
dog
world
,
all
will
be
helping
to
create
future
dog
owners
.

The
Kansas
City
and
the
Topeka
KCs
are
arranging
that
Juniors
who
win
at
their
shows
will
be
qualified
to
win
points
for
Westminster

Comes
the
suspicious
question
.

Once
settled
,
we're
careful
to
walk
the
dogs
in
an
out
of
the
way
spot
,
keep
them
under
control
in
the
room
,
and
feed
and
bench
them
where
they
can't
do
any
harm
to
the
furnishings
or
the
furniture
.

Boats
are
operated
in
every
state
in
the
Union
,
with
the
heaviest
concentrations
along
both
coasts
and
in
the
Middle
West
.

The
spectacular
upsurge
in
pleasure
boating
is
markedly
evident
,
expectedly
,
in
the
areas
where
boats
have
always
been
found
:
the
natural
lakes
,
rivers
,
and
along
the
nation's
coastline
.

Developed
as
a
result
of
the
multi-purpose
resources
control
program
of
the
government
,
vast
,
man-made
bodies
of
water
represent
a
kind
of
glorious
fringe
benefit
,
providing
boating
and
fishing
havens
all
over
the
country
.

No
matter
how
determined
or
wealthy
boating
lovers
of
the
Southwest
had
been
,
for
example
,
they
could
never
have
created
anything
approaching
the
fifty
square-mile
Lake
Texoma
,
located
between
Texas
and
Oklahoma
,
which
resulted
when
the
Corp
of
Army
Engineers
dammed
the
Red
River
.

In
1959
,
according
to
the
Engineers
,
Lake
Texoma
was
only
one
of
thirty-two
artificial
lakes
and
reservoirs
which
were
used
for
recreation
by
over
1,000,000
persons
.

It
is
a
simple
task
to
haul
a
boat
fifty
or
one
hundred
miles
to
a
lake
or
reservoir
on
the
new
,
light
,
strong
,
easy-to-operate
trailers
which
are
built
to
accommodate
almost
any
kind
of
small
boat
and
retail
from
$100
to
$2,000
.

The
boats
of
America's
trailer
sailors
in
1961
will
be
coddled
on
clouds
as
they
are
hauled
to
new
horizons
.

They
range
from
an
eight-foot
pram
,
which
you
can
build
yourself
for
less
than
$50
,
to
auxiliary
sailboats
which
can
cost
over
$100,000
.

In
this
respect
,
boats
can
be
compared
with
houses
.

You
may
dress
it
up
with
any
number
of
accessories
or
keep
it
as
simple
as
you
choose
.

I
wonder
if
anyone
ever
bothered
to
make
the
point
that
when
it
comes
to
boats
and
their
motors
,
Americans
excel
over
any
country
in
the
world
in
the
long
run
.

Their
cost
is
not
beyond
the
hopes
of
the
American
pocketbook
,
the
range
being
about
$150
to
$1,000
,
depending
on
size
.

and
to
making
the
owning
of
a
boat
simpler
.

Terms
and
rates
of
interest
for
motors
generally
follow
those
for
home
appliances
.

If
your
state
has
no
provisions
for
the
numbering
of
pleasure
boats
,
you
must
apply
for
a
number
from
the
U.S.
Coast
Guard
for
any
kind
of
boat
with
mechanical
propulsion
rated
at
more
than
10
horsepower
before
it
can
be
used
on
Federal
waterways
.

lack
of
ability
and
common
sense
can
lead
to
just
as
much
tragedy
.

Yachtel
,
a
relatively
new
word
,
indicates
a
waterfront
type
of
hotel
where
a
yachtsman
may
dock
and
find
overnight
accommodations
on
the
premises
as
well
as
other
services
.

The
design
of
a
mechanical
interlocking
frame
is
much
like
a
mechanical
puzzle
,
but
once
understood
,
the
principles
can
be
applied
to
any
track
and
signal
arrangement
.

In
the
frame
are
two
sets
of
bars
which
interact
with
each
other
to
prevent
the
operator
from
making
dangerous
moves
.

A
signal
cannot
be
cleared
until
all
the
related
turnouts
are
properly
thrown
and
locked
.

Generally
,
these
locks
on
turnouts
are
called
``
facing
point
locks
''
.

The
lines
connecting
the
wedge-shaped
dogs
represent
the
locking
bars
at
right
angles
to
the
tappet
bars
.

As
an
engineer
approaches
the
plant
the
position
of
the
home
signal
is
seen
in
advance
when
he
passes
the
``
distant
''
signal
located
beyond
the
limits
of
the
interlocking
plant
.

The
interlocking
frame
we
built
at
the
model
railroader
workshop
and
then
installed
on
Paul
Larson's
railroad
follows
the
Fig.
1
scheme
and
is
shown
beginning
in

of
the

all
the

required
for

the

are
not
pinched
by
a

Number
all
the
tappet
bars
before
removing
them
so
they
can
be
replaced
in
the
same
slots

The
order
of

important

Place
the

Scribe
a

across
the

Scribe

bar
and
rough
out
with
either
a
hack
saw
or
a
cutting
disk
in
a

power
tool
.

Such
disks
are
very
handy
for
cutting
and
shaping
small
parts
.

Endeavor
to
get
the
notches
as
much
alike
as
possible

Assemble
the
parts
in
the

Without
math
the
men
who
are
continually
seeking
the
causes
of
and
the
reasons
for
the
many
things
that
make
the
world
go
'round
would
not
have
any
means
of
analyzing
,
standardizing
,
and
communicating
the
things
they
discover
and
learn
.

For
example

Numbers
separated
by
addition
symbols
may
be
placed
in
any
order
.

Charts
for
this
purpose
are
available
from
many
sources
.

Rodding
formulas
apply
to
many
phases
of
the
sport
.

However
,
some
formulas
are
used
more
than
others
.

Displacement
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
``
swept
volume
''
.

It
is
good
to
be
able
to
compute
displacement
so
that
changes
in
it
resulting
from
boring
and
stroking
can
be
computed
.

Factors
involved
in
the
displacement
formula
are
the
bore
diameter
of
the
engine's
cylinders
,
the
length
of
the
piston
stroke
,
the
number
of
cylinders
in
the
engine
,
and
a
constant
.

The
constant
is
,
which
is
one-quarter
of
3.1416
,
another
constant
known
as
``
pi
''
.

Pi
is
used
in
formulas
concerned
with
the
dimensions
of
circles
.

The
formula
is
:
Af
.

Dimensions
in
centimeters
and
fractions
of
centimeters
will
give
the
displacement
in
cubic
centimeters
(
cc.
)
.

For
example
,
let's
consider
a
standard
283
cubic
inch
Chevy
Aj
.

The
different
steps
will
look
like
this
:
Af

Cylinder
volume
is
determined
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
for
the
displacement
formula
:
Af
.

To
measure
the
volume
of
one
of
the
combustion
chambers
in
the
cylinder
head
,
install
the
valves
and
spark
plug
in
the
chamber
and
support
the
head
so
that
its
gasket
surface
is
level
.

Most
beakers
are
graduated
in
cubic
centimeters
(
cc.
)
,
making
it
necessary
to
convert
the
result
to
cubic
inches
.

Sometimes
it
is
necessary
to
roughly
calculate
the
square
inch
area
of
the
opening
but
the
calculation
can
usually
be
made
with
sufficient
accuracy
that
it
won't
affect
the
final
computation
.

Compute
this
volume
by
measuring
the
distance
from
the
top
of
the
block
to
the
piston
head
as
accurately
as
possible
with
a
depth
micrometer
or
some
other
precision
measuring
device
and
then
multiply
the
area
of
the
cylinder
by
the
depth
.

The
total
of
these
three
volumes
is
the
``
final
combustion
chamber
volume
''
.

.

For
an
example
let's
dream
up
an
engine
that
has
a
final
combustion
chamber
volume
of
5
cubic
inches
and
a
cylinder
volume
of
45
cubic
inches
.

Rear

ratio

Tire
size
can
be
determined
in
several
ways
but
the
one
that
is
the
easiest
and
as
accurate
as
any
is
by
measuring
the
effective
radius
of
a
wheel
and
tire
assembly
.

A
tire
must
be
inflated
to
its
normal
hot
operating
pressure
and
the
car
must
be
loaded
to
its
operating
weight
when
this
measurement
is
made
.

Any
fraction
of
an
inch
involved
in
the
measurement
must
be
converted
to
a
decimal
equivalent
to
simplify
the
mathematics
.

Using
the
figures
from
the
previous
examples
,
the
equation
becomes
:

H.

who
,
according
to
the
railbirds
,
can
feel
justly
proud
of
her
.

Monel
shows
improvement
with
each
work-out
and
looks
the
makings
of
a
good
brood
mare
after
winning
her
share
of
races
.

They
are
two
good
colts
of
different
type
.

Fury
is
upstanding
and
on
the
rangy
side
,
and
Caper
is
more
the
compact
type
.

I
have
never
seen
Caper
off
his
feet
--
he
seems
to
know
nothing
but
'
trot
'
and
keeps
trying
a
little
harder
if
asked
to
do
so
.

It
took
this
colt
several
weeks
to
strike
a
pace
.

This
colt
arrived
at
the
Raceway
early
last
November
,
and
immediately
was
put
into
harness
and
line-driven
for
a
few
days
,
and
then
put
to
cart
and
broken
in
very
nicely
,
knowing
nothing
but
trot
.

His
best
mile
to
date
is
2:32.2
.

His
best
time
is
around
2:33
.

She
was
then
trained
on
the
trot
until
December
29
,
hitched
to
a
breaking
cart
once
around
the
half-mile
track
and
hoppled
again
.

Up
to
date
she
is
a
grand-looking
filly
.

This
colt
is
another
fine-looking
equine
.

The
first
time
I
saw
the
latter
filly
she
trotted
by

This

trot
she
did
until
forced

do
otherwise

She

she
hopped
,
she
rolled
and
rocked
,
skipped
and
jumped
,
but
in
some
two
weeks
she
started
to
pace
,
From
that

this
she
has
shown
steady
improvement
and
now
looks

one

Such
modifications
are
all
for
the
best
but
it
takes
something
as
different
as
a
Deerstalker
or
a
Jet
to
change
arms-making
concepts
.

Bill
Ruger's
long-awaited
Deerstalker
(
under
$110
)
is
a
new
rifle
action
in
a
caliber
that
upsets
all
the
modern
theory
of
high-velocity
fans
;
;

it's
a
short
,
light
,
quick-handling
,
fast-firing
little
timber
gun
designed
to
push
a
heavy
slug
at
modest
velocity
but
with
lots
of
killing
power
and
ample
range
for
our
most
popular
big
game
--
whitetail
.

The
second
really
new
development
this
year
was
a
revolver
handling
a
different
sort
of
varmint
load
--
the

,
40-grain
bullet
is
rated
at
a
very
hot
2,460
fps
,
and
it's
the
flattest
shooting
of
any
revolver
cartridge
,
with
a
mid-range
rise
of
about
an
inch
over
a
100-yard
range
.

I
tested
it
in
my
scoped
S
&
W
and
it
was
good
enough
to
allow
me
to
hit
a
chuck
with
every
shot
at
100
yards
if
I
did
my
part
by
holding
the
handgun
steadily
.

A
shortened
version
of
the
highly
regarded
Remington

also
appeared
in
1961
.

This

is
hard

Although
there
were
no
startling
developments
in
shotgun
design
this
year
,
a
number
of
new
models
and
variations
of
existing
models
did
hit
the
market
.

High
Standard
has
also
added
two
models
to

They
did
not
complain
at
the
inhuman
hour
of
starting
(
seven

nor
of

which
was
reasonable
since
it
covered
everything
but
the

kept

served
--
was
a
standby
at
Manning's
.

this
was
merely
a
ritual
,
to
please
all
hands
concerned
.

departing
,
they
stepped
solemnly
with
knees
lifted
to
the
jaw
,
for
they
had
been
trained
to
drag
at
important
funerals
.

They
had
been
fed
a
hunting
breakfast
,
so
called
because
a
kedgeree
,
the
dish
identified
with
fox
hunting
,
was
on
the
bill
.

As
things
happened
,
Morgan
was
installed
in
the
Nob
Hill
residence
of
a
magnate
friend
,
whose
kitchen
swarmed
with
cooks
of
approved
talent
.

They
cantered
down
the
peninsula
,
not
slackening
until
the
coach
reached
Woodside
where
the
Santa
Cruz
uplands
begin
.

The
Santa
Cruz
mountains
sprawl
over
three
counties
,
and
the
roads
twist
through
sky-tapping
redwoods
down
whose
furrowed
columns
ripple
streams
of
rain
,
even
when
heat
bakes
the
Santa
Clara
valley
below
at
the
left
.

The
water
splashes
into
shoulder-high
tracts
of
fernery
.

they
were
struck
out
with
remarks
in
red
ink
,
denouncing
both
the
cooks
and
the
management
.

He
was
copious
in
his
praise
of
those
that
served
food
that
was
good
to
eat
.

Many
of
its
sojourners
were
devoted
to
seclusion
and
quiet
,
and
lived
there
to
the
end
of
their
days
.

No

complained
of
the
white
wine
either
:
at
this
altitude
of
two
thousand
feet
,
grapes
acquire
a
dryness
and
the
tang
of
gunflint
.

Dwellers
thereabouts
preferred
to
get
their
apple
pies
at
the
local
bakery
,
which
had
a
brick
oven
fired
with
redwood
billets

a
stay

just
one
of
these

Among

drops

In
the
Utah

It
is
an
exotic
place
,
so
different
from
the
ordinary
that
the
casual
tourist
is
likely
to
see
at
first
only
the
contrast
and
the
ugliness
of
narrow
streets
lined
with
haphazard
houses
.

Whole
blocks
are
disappearing
and
more
are
scheduled
to
vanish
to
make
room
for
wide
boulevards
that
will
show
off
its
treasures
to
better
advantage
--
the
great
domes
and
graceful
spires
of
its
mosques
,
the
panorama
of
the
Bosphorus
and
the
Golden
Horn
.

For
almost
3,000
years
Europe
and
Asia
have
rubbed
shoulders
in

to
get

American
World

,
four
hours
from

.

Start
of
tour

At
the
top
of
the
hill
the
buildings
on
the
left
gave
way
to
a
park
.

In
the
second
half
of
the
Sixteenth
Century
,
Sinan
,
the
great
architect
who
is
the
Michelangelo
of
the
East
,
designed
the
massive
buttresses
that
now
help
support
the
dome
.

With
the
birth
of
the
Turkish
Republic
after
the
First
World
War
,
St.
Sophia
became
a
museum
,
and
the
ancient
mosaics
,
which
were
plastered
over
by
the
Moslems
,
whose
religion
forbids
pictures
in
holy
places
,
have
been
restored
.

Directly
opposite
is
the
emperor's
door
,
through
which
they
entered
the
building
.

Outside
St.
Sophia
I
walked
through
the
flower
garden
in
front
of
it
,
with
the
Blue
Mosque
ahead
on
my
left
.

Beyond
it
I
noted
a
small
green
column
,
about
twelve
feet
below
the
present
ground
level
--
the
Serpentine
Column
,
three
entwined
serpents
,
which
once
stood
at
the
Temple
of
Apollo
at
Delphi
,
Greece
.

The
round
minarets
,
tall
and
graceful
,
rise
from
rectangular
bases
and
have
three
platforms
from
which
the
muezzin
can
chant
his
call
to
prayer
.

Called
the
Marmara
Gazinosu
,
it
is
on
the
third
floor
,
with
signs
pointing
the
way
there
,
and
has
a
terrace
overlooking
the
Sea
of
Marmara
.

Passing
through
the
gate
,
with
towers
on
either
side
once
used
as
prisons
,
I
entered
a
huge
square
surrounded
by
buildings
,
and
on
the
wall
to
my
right
found
a
general
plan
of
the
grounds
,
with
explanations
in
English
for
each
building
.

I
walked
to
the
right
around
it
to
buildings
containing
illuminated
manuscripts
and
came
to
the
Treasury
,
which
houses
such
things
as
coffee
cups
covered
with
diamonds
,
jewelled
swords
,
rifles
glittering
with
diamonds
and
huge
divan-like
thrones
as
large
as
small
beds
,
on
which
the
sultans
sat
cross-legged
.

(
Do
start
fires
one
or
two
hours
ahead
of
time
to
obtain
a
lasting
bed
of
glowing
coals
.

Keep
the
desserts
simple
;
;

)

Don't
think
you
have
to
start
with
the
most
expensive
equipment
in
the
world
.

The
simplest
grill
(
pan
type
)
or
inexpensive
hibachi
can
make
you
a
chef
.

And
lots
of
hot
pads
!
!

There
is
even
one
set
that
has
``
barbecue
''
written
on
it
.

Except
when
you
prepare
``
do
it
yourself
''
shish
kebob
or
a
lobster
roast
.

It's
year-round
,
and
everywhere
.

In
the
winter
,
hibachi
in
the
kitchen
or
grill
over
the
logs
of
the
fireplace
.

Get
copper
or
earthenware
mugs
that
keep
beer
chilled
or
soup
hot
.

For
25-cents
load
up
the
cooler
with
ice
and
keep
cool
pop
in
the
car
.

A
story
goes
that
a
certain
Herr
Feuchtwanger
of
St.
Louis
,
around
1883
served
his
sausages
(
grilled
)
and
mustard
to
his
fancy
customers
.

The
nation's
number
one
picnic
treat
is
the
skinless
frankfurter
--
toasted
over
a
bonfire
on
the
beach
or
,
more
sedately
,
charcoal
broiled
on
a
portable
grill
.

This
permits
the
juices
to
permeate
the
meat
during
cooking
.

--
An
unusual
flavor
can
be
achieved
by
marinating
the
franks
in
French
dressing
or
a
mixture
of
honey
,
lemon
juice
and
brown
sugar
prior
to
the
picnic
.

Here
are
a
couple
of
the
latest
,
highly
styled
ways
to
fix
skinless
franks
in
your
own
back
yard
!

You'll
have
the
neighbor's
eyes
popping
as
well
as
their
mouths
watering

Menfolk
can

.

The
80-hp
motor
drives
her
at
25
mph
with
six
aboard
!
!

With
only
two
aboard
,
Hotei
does
better
than
27
mph
--
and
she
gives
a
comfortable
ride
at
this
speed
even
in
a
three-foot
chop
.

On
each
side
of
the
motor
well
there's
storage
for
battery
,
bumpers
,
line
and
spare
props
with
six-gallon
gas
tanks
below
.

Consider
what
you
have
to
earn
to
be
able
to
spend
the
$3,000
and
your
building
time
is
well
worth
it
.

A
Gator
trailer
,
Model
565
,
is
used
to
transport
the
boat
to
the
waterways
.

This
piece
of
equipment
costs
a
little
over
$600
but
it
will
save
you
that
in
mooring
and
hauling
fees
in
a
few
years
.

All
framing
in
Hotei
is
one-inch
mahogany
which
,
in
the
dressed
state
you
buy
it
,
is
about
the
thickness
specified
in
the
drawings
.

Therefore
,
the
lumber
is
bought
in
planks
and
ripped
to
size
for
battens
,
etc.
,
on
a
table
saw
.

After
notching
it
for
the
keelson
,
chines
and
battens
,
the
half-inch
plywood
transom
is
secured
to
it
with
glue
and
the
same
type
nails
.

All
frames
are
butted
at
the
joints
and
plywood
gussets
are
glued
and
nailed
on
each
side
of
each
joint
,
again
using
the
one-inch
,
No.
12
nails
.

The
frames
are
notched
only
for
the
keelson
and
the
chines
.

This
is
an
important
step
because
any
misalignment
would
cause
progressively
worse
misalignment
in
the
hull
as
you
advance
in
construction
.

After
the
frames
and
transom
are
set
up
on
the
jig
and
temporarily
braced
,
a
piece
of
three-inch-wide
mahogany
(
only
widths
will
be
given
since
the
thickness
is
used
throughout
)
is
butted
between
frames
one
and
two
below
the
line
of
the
keelson
.

One-inch
,
No.
10
screws
are
used
in
both
cases
.

The
second
two
pieces
lap
over
the
inner
member
of
the
keelson
and
butt
against
the
outer
member
.

The
side
ones
are
a
half-inch
narrower
.

The
battens
are
carefully
fastened
in
place
after
some
necessary
fairing
on
all
frames
.

Glue
and
,
No.
10
screws
are
used
.

The
chines
go
in
the
same
way
except
that
they
are
made
of
two
pieces
of
two-inch
wood
for
strength
and
easier
bending
.

Fairing
is
always
a
tedious
job
but
the
work
can
be
cut
down
considerably
with
a
Skill
planer
and
a
simple
jig
.

The
42-inch
width
leaves
very
little
waste
.

Plank
the
sides
first
,
using
glue
and
one-inch
,
No.
12
Stronghold
nails
at
all
battens
,
the
stem
and
the
transom
.

The
best
procedure
is
to
have
a
few
friends
hold
the
planking
in
place
while
you
mark
it
off
.

After
planking
,
the
bottom
gets
a
layer
of
Fiberglas
.

Then
the
chines
are
rounded
off
and
the
bottom
is
rough-sanded
in
preparation
.

A
50-inch
width
is
used
on
each
side
and
it
laps
the
keel
line
by
about
three
inches
.

Before
the
resin
has
hardened
,
screw
a
one-inch
mahogany
keel
strip
along
the
centerline
.

They
will
also
supply
literature
on
application
.

The
hull
is
now
turned
over
(
with
the
help
of
about
seven
friends
)
and
placed
in
a
level
,
well-braced
position
.

For
added
strength
,
I
also
fastened
a
small
block
on
each
side
of
every
frame
and
batten
joint
.

This
is
made
up
of
scraps
left
over
from
the
sides
and
bottom
.

When
they're
on
,
the
top
edges
are
planed
even
with
the
sheer
batten
.

The
decking
is
quarter-inch
mahogany
marine
plywood
.

These
battens
are
glued
and
screwed
to
the
frames
.

With
all
deck
battens
in
place
,
the
bilge
is
cleaned
and
painted
up
to
the
floor
line
.

Available
in
Af
sheets
,
it
costs
about
a
dollar
a
square
foot
.

It
is
a
full
scale
,
small
,
but
efficient
house
that
can
become
a
year
'round
retreat
complete
in
every
detail
.

In
recognition
of
the
growing
trend
for
second
homes
,
or
vacation
cottages
,
we
have
designed
this
one
specifically
with
the
family
handyman
in
mind
.

The
theory

Then
you
can
do
the
finishing
touches
at
your
leisure
.

Due
to
the
fact
that
building
codes
and
regulations
vary
so
much
throughout
the
country
,
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
find
out
what
,
if
any
,
they
are
.

This
can
usually
be
found
out
at
the
nearest
town
hall
.

At
the
same
time
check
the
electrical
,
plumbing
,
and
sanitary
requirements
,
as
well
as
possible
zoning
regulations
.

If
there
are
any
major
restrictions
,
they
usually
can
be
obtained
in
printed
form
.

Don't
worry
too
much
about
rocky
or
sloping
terrain
;
;

With
this
first
issue
we
give
you
a
list
of
the
materials
needed
to
build
the
basic
(
AjA
version
)
and
the
expandable
(
AjB
version
)
.

In
any
case
,
there
is
no
special
milling
or
rabbeting
required
for
the
panels
.

The
drill
press
consists
of
a
vertical
shaft
(
spindle
)
which
is
tapered
or
threaded
on
one
end
to
hold
a
drill
chuck
,
a
tubular
housing
(
quill
)
in
which
the
spindle
is
mounted
,
a
head
in
which
the
quill
is
mounted
,
a
feed
lever
which
moves
the
quill
up
or
down
,
a
power
source
,
and
a
movable
table
upon
which
the
work
is
placed
.

A
press
with
an
11
inch
capacity
lets
you
drill
to
the
center
of
a
22
inch
board
or
circle
.

The
drill
press
should
be
leveled
and
,
depending
on
whether
it
is
a
bench
or
floor
model
,
bolted
securely
to
a
sturdy
bench
or
stand
or
screwed
to
the
floor
with
lag
or
expansion
screws
.

wiping
with
a
slightly
oiled
cloth
will
discourage
rusting
of
the
column
and
quill
.

Turning
the
housing
clockwise
will
reduce
tension
,
counter-clockwise
will
increase
it
.

otherwise
,
you'll
have
to
spend
a
few
minutes
to
either
attach
a
suitable
spring
clip
somewhere
on
the
press
head
or
fit
the
key
to
a
length
of
light
chain
and
fasten
to
the
bottom
of
the
motor
mount
so
that
the
key
is
out
of
the
way
when
not
in
use
.

Generally
,
the
larger
the
tool
and
the
harder
the
material
,
the
slower
the
speed
.

Too
much
pressure
will
force
the
tool
beyond
its
cutting
capacity
and
result
in
rough
cuts
and
jammed
or
broken
tools
.

The
best
results
will
be
obtained
by
matching
the
correct
speed
with
a
steady
feed
pressure
that
lets
the
tool
cut
easily
at
an
even
rate
.

There
are
numerous
types
and
styles
of
tools
to
drill
holes
.

When
drilling
all
the
way
through
a
workpiece
,
always
place
a
piece
of
scrap
wood
underneath
.

For
their
length
,
their
types
of
construction
,
their
picturesque
settings
,
and
their
literary
associations
,
they
should
be
known
and
remembered
.

Its
building
was
first
proposed
in
1791
,
when
a
group
of
citizens
,
mostly
Newburyport
men
,
petitioned
the
General
Court
for
an
act
of
incorporation
.

The
matter
was
considered
and
reconsidered
,
and
finally
opposed
,
but
in
spite
of
many
objections
,
the
Court
granted
a
charter
on
January
9
,
1792
.

It
is
hardly
necessary
to
remind
students
of
covered
bridges
that
Timothy
Palmer
was
born
in
1751
in
nearby
Rowley
;
;

It
was
indeed
a
remarkable
feat
that
a
man
who
had
had
no
experience
of
bridge
building
should
have
applied
the
principle
of
the
arch
,
which
appears
in
his
famous
bridges
at
Portsmouth
,
Haverhill
,
and
Philadelphia
.

Between
the
abutments
on
the
Newbury
shore
and
the
south
bank
of
Deer
Island
there
was
one
span
or
arch
measuring
160
feet
;
;

A
dinner
and
celebration
in
honor
of
this
piece
of
engineering
took
place
July
4
,
1793
,
in
a
tavern
erected
by
the
corporation
on
the
island
.

This
was
built
by
John
Templeman
from
plans
submitted
by
James
Finley
of
Fayette
County
,
Pennsylvania
.

Information
is
hereby
given
that
Mr.
Timothy
Palmer
of
Newburyport
,
Mass.
has
agreed
to
take
charge
of
the
concerns
of
the
Patentees
of
the
Chain
Bridge
,
in
the
states
of
Massachusetts
,
New
Hampshire
,
Vermont
,
Rhode
Island
,
and
Connecticut
,
so
far
as
relates
to
the
sale
of
Patent
rights
and
the
construction
of
Chain
Bridges
.

``
Mr.
Palmer
will
attend
to
any
applications
relating
to
bridges
and
if
desired
will
view
the
proposed
site
,
and
lay
out
and
superintend
the
work
,
or
recommend
a
suitable
person
to
execute
it
.

This
chain
bridge
proved
less
durable
than
the
wooden
arch
on
the
Salisbury
end
.

The
Essex
bridge
was
a
toll
crossing
until
1868
,
when
the
County
Commissioners
laid
out
all
the
Merrimack
bridges
as
highways
.

It
is
one
of
the
very
few
,
if
not
the
only
surviving
bridge
of
its
type
to
serve
a
main
artery
of
the
U.S.
highway
system
,
thus
it
is
far
more
than
a
relic
of
the
horse
and
buggy
days
.

Union
soldiers
at
times
used
it
for
sleeping
quarters
to
escape
from
the
rain
or
other
inclement
weather
,
and
some
of
them
left
momentoes
of
their
stay
by
carving
their
names
and
small
tokens
on
its
walls
and
beams
.

Reverend
Joshual
Corder
,
a
Baptist
minister
,
gathered
a
few
citizens
of
Southern
sympathies
,
to
call
on
Jones
and
plead
with
him
to
spare
the
structure
;
;

Again
Reverend
Corder
saved
the
bridge
when
Union
soldiers
planned
to
destroy
it
,
after
filling
its
two
lanes
with
hay
and
straw
--
but
for
what
reason
is
not
recorded
nor
remembered
,
certainly
not
because
of
pressure
from
an
opposing
Confederate
force
.

On
the
second
occasion
it
took
prayers
as
well
as
reason
to
dissuade
the
soldiers
from
their
purpose
.

It
is
a
good
eight
years
now
since
each
of
us
acquired
a
swimming
pool
--
eight
enlightening
,
vigorous
,
rigorous
,
not
wholly
unrewarding
years
.

We
have
become
amateur
insurance
experts
and
fine-feathered
yard
birds
.

One
of
us
has
a
pool
set
in
a
wooded
area
very
near
the
house
.

On
the
other
hand
,
out-of-sight
does
not
lead
to
out-of-mind
when
children
cannot
be
easily
observed
and
you
have
to
make
a
long
trek
to
reach
the
pool
.

Even
a
neat
,
plastic-covered
plunge
is
not
exactly
a
joy
to
behold
.

)

Naturally
it
will
be
dictated
to
a
large
extent
by
the
shape
and
size
of
your
land
.

After
the
first
few
weeks
,
it
was
obvious
that
rules
had
to
be
made
,
laid
down
and
obeyed
--
even
if
our
popularity
ratings
became
subnormal
as
a
result
.

Since
our
viewpoints
in
this
respect
coincided
precisely
,
we
present
the
fruits
of
our
efforts
herewith
as
a
single
social
code
for
pool
owners
.

Just
short
of
forty
lashes
we
finally
managed
to
coerce
our
children
to
this
view
.

Their
friends
and
ours
are
welcome
to
share
the
pool
,
but
on
our
terms
and
at
our
times
.

No
ringers
,
either
--
even
if
they
are
trailing
legitimate
invitees
.

No
young
children
may
come
without
adults
except
for
a
specific
,
organized
,
chaperoned
party
.

And
accompanying
adults
are
urged
to
keep
an
alert
and
sensible
eye
on
their
responsibilities
.

)

We
also
worked
out
logistics
for
Sunday
afternoon
swimmers
who
arrive
two
hours
early
with
their
weekend
guests
while
we
are
still
enjoying
an
alfresco
lunch
en
famille
.

Life-preservers
,
the
buckle-on
kapok-filled
kind
,
are
held
in
readiness
,
too
,
for
the
very
young
.

Preserving
life
and
limb

Or
you
can
make
pool
care
the
price
of
swimming
for
teen-agers
.

You
need
algaecide
.

With
or
without
professional
help
,
you
will
have
to
be
able
to
do
some
of
these
jobs
yourself
unless
you
have
a
full-time
pool
nurse
.

When
shed
,
they
leave
rust
marks
.

You
can
hope
against
hope
that
come
spring
cleaning
,
your
fair-weather
friends
will
lend
a
hand
at
scrubbing
and
furbishing
.

It
has
happened
.

Our
experience
has
taught
us
that
it
pays
to
buy
the
best
equipment
possible
,
from
pipes
to
brushes
.

Even
if
you
live
above
that
line
,
the
FHA
will
back
you
,
for
they
have
decided
that
the
inclusion
of
air
conditioning
in
all
new
homes
is
a
good
thing
and
should
be
encouraged
.

Two
men
can
often
do
the
installation
in
a
day
.

No
less
an
authority
than
the
FHA
concurs
that
the
savings
air
conditioning
makes
possible
more
than
offset
its
operating
costs
.

The
cleaner
air
means
less
time
spent
pushing
a
vacuum
,
fewer
trips
to
the
dry
cleaners
,
lighter
loads
for
the
washing
machine
.

Clothes
hold
their
shape
better
,
and
mildew
and
rust
become
almost
forgotten
words
.

You'll
sleep
longer
and
better
,
too
,
awake
refreshed
and
free
of
hot
weather
nerves
.

For
any
house
.

No
matter
what
style
your
home
is
,
ranch
,
two-story
,
Colonial
or
contemporary
,
central
air
conditioning
is
easily
installed
.

If
that's
done
,
the
house
can
be
designed
and
oriented
for
best
operation
,
and
this
can
mean
savings
both
in
the
size
of
equipment
and
in
the
cost
of
the
house
itself
.

The
cooling
coil
is
located
in
the
furnace's
outlet
.

These
systems
are
more
expensive
than
year-'round
forced
air
systems
.

The
minimum
cost
for
an
average
one-story
,
7-room
house
with
basement
,
is
likely
to
run
$1500
above
the
cost
of
the
heating
alone
.

A
relatively
simple
switching
arrangement
reverses
the
cycle
so
that
the
machine
literally
runs
backward
,
and
the
heat
is
extracted
from
outdoor
air
and
turned
indoors
.

How
large
a
cooling
unit
you
need
,
and
the
method
of
its
installation
,
depends
on
a
variety
of
factors
.

A
very
rough
rule
of
thumb
is
that
,
under
favorable
conditions
,
you'll
need
15
BTU's
of
cooling
for
every
square
foot
of
your
house
.

You'll
need
more
if
the
high
average
is
above
that
,
less
if
it's
below
.

You
may
find
a
conditioner
rated
by
horsepower
.

The
safest
procedure
is
to
let
your
builder
estimate
the
size
of
the
unit
you
need
,
rather
than
trying
to
do
this
yourself
.

An
oversize
unit
will
cool
off
your
house
quickly
,
then
shut
down
for
a
long
period
.

With
a
unit
of
the
right
size
,
a
compressor
will
run
continuously
during
hot
weather
,
reducing
humidity
as
evenly
as
it
does
temperature
.

A
well-designed
,
1200-square-foot
house
can
be
comfortably
cooled
and
heated
for
as
little
as
$128
a
year
,
or
$11
a
month
.

If
you
have
a
house
which
heat
doesn't
penetrate
easily
,
your
unit
will
have
less
heat
to
remove
.

Keep
the
direct
sun
from
reaching
the
house
and
you've
won
the
first
battle
.

If
the
house
you
plan
to
buy
or
build
won't
have
big
overhangs
,
you
can
still
do
a
fair
job
of
keeping
the
sun
off
walls
and
windows
with
properly
designed
trellises
,
fences
and
awnings
.

The
way
a
house
is
set
on
its
lot
can
therefore
influence
how
much
cooling
you're
going
to
need
.

You
can
use
heat-absorbing
glass
to
stop
the
sun
,
double
glass
and
insulated
glass
to
combat
condensation
.

Keeping
conditioners
quiet
.

Good
workmanship
is
important
in
the
installation
,
so
if
you're
doing
your
own
contracting
,
don't
award
the
job
on
the
basis
of
price
alone
.

Most
recreation
work
calls
for
a
good
deal
of
pre-planning
.

These
are
inexpensive
and
available
from
the
U.
S.
Geological
Society
,
Washington
25
,
D.
C.
.

For
site
planning
work
,
it
is
best
to
have
a
qualified
and
experienced
park
planner
to
carry
through
the
study
.

County
judges
,
commissioners
,
engineers
,
assessors
,
and
others
who
have
lived
in
the
area
for
a
long
time
may
have
valuable
knowledge
regarding
the
site
or
opinions
to
offer
from
their
varied
professional
experiences
.

How
useful
will
it
be
to
the
public
?
?

Quality
is
vitally
important
.

Note
extent
of
these
interests
and
how
available
they
will
be
for
the
public
to
enjoy
.

Other
factors
,
such
as
water
temperature
,
depth
of
water
,
the
fish
life
it
supports
,
wave
action
,
flooding
,
etcetera
,
will
affect
its
recreation
value
.

The
site
may
be
on
one
of
the
major
flyways
of
migratory
birds
or
have
its
own
resident
bird
life
.

Each
area
has
its
own
historical
interests
with
which
much
can
be
done
.

Park
visitors
are
always
eager
to
learn
more
about
the
area
they
are
in
.

How
well
can
the
site
be
developed
?
?

Acreage
in
excess
of
the
minimum
is
good
practice
as
recreation
areas
are
never
too
large
for
the
future
and
it
is
often
more
economical
to
operate
one
large
area
than
several
small
ones
.

Topography

--
In
addition
to
its
recreation
interests
,
water
is
needed
for
drinking
,
sanitation
,
and
irrigation
.

Plants

The
extent
and
location
of
open
areas
is
noted
.

Sometimes
,
you
have
a
choice
of
exposure
for
sites
where
the
topography
or
trees
of
the
area
will
provide
afternoon
shade
,
morning
sun
,
or
whatever
may
be
most
desirable
for
the
use
intended
.

and
with
sober
purpose
,
because
the
development
of
Prokofieff
personifies
,
in
many
ways
,
the
course
of
music
in
the
Union
of
Soviet
Socialist
Republics
.

What
was
it
to
Prokofieff
?
?

I
remember
Ernest
Bloch
in
the
foyer
,
shouting
in
his
high-pitched
voice
:
``
it
may
be
a
tour
de
force
,
mais
mon
Dieu
,
can
anyone
take
this
music
seriously
''
?
?

The
answer
is
,
``
Yes
''
!
!

Here
,
this
happy
,
roving
son
of
good
fortune
proved
that
he
could
accept
the
disciplines
of
a
new
social-economic
order
fighting
for
its
very
existence
and
ideals
in
a
truculent
world
.

Here
,
Prokofieff
became
a
workman
in
the
vineyards
of
Socialism
--
producing
music
for
the
masses
.

It
is
at
this
point
in
his
life
that
the
mature
Prokofieff
emerges
.

One
might
have
expected
that
such
a
violent
epoch
of
transition
would
have
destroyed
the
creative
flair
of
a
composer
,
especially
one
whose
works
were
so
fluent
and
spontaneous
.

This
is
precisely
what
makes
lucid
,
straightforward
music
so
difficult
to
compose
--
the
clarity
must
be
new
,
not
old
''
.

the
later
works
were
conceived
to
affirm
a
way
of
life
for
fellow
citizens
.

In
orchestration
,
he
stretches
the
limits
of
instrumentation
with
good
judgment
and
a
fine
imagination
for
color
.

His
counterpoint
is
pertinent
,
skillful
,
and
rarely
thick
.

Need
for
novelty
may
be
a
symptom
of
cultural
fatigue
and
instability
.

Nor
can
anyone
be
certain
that
Prokofieff
would
have
done
better
,
or
even
as
well
,
under
different
circumstances
.

I
think
the
answer
is
to
be
found
in
Prokofieff's
own
words
:
``
the
clarity
must
be
new
,
not
old
''
.

Prokofieff
was
guided
in
a
consistent
direction
by
the
life
of
his
own
people
--
by
the
compass
of
their
national
ideas
.

But
time
is
running
out
,
and
many
of
Stravinsky's
admirers
begin
to
fear
that
he
will
never
find
terra
firma
.

What
a
patchwork
of
proclamations
and
renunciations
!
!

How
differently
Prokofieff's
life
unfolded
.

In
the
process
,
his
native
endowments
were
stretched
,
strengthened
and
disciplined
to
serve
their
human
purpose
.

With
a
large
and
circumspect
20th-Century
technique
,
he
wove
the
materials
of
national
heroes
and
events
,
national
folklore
and
children's
fairy
tales
--
Slavic
dances
and
love
songs
--
into
a
solid
musical
literature
which
served
his
people
well
,
and
is
providing
much
enjoyment
to
the
World
at
large
.

As
a
boy
Roy
Mason
began
the
long
process
of
extracting
the
goodness
of
the
out-of-doors
,
its
tang
of
weather
,
its
change
of
seasons
,
its
variable
moods
.

Mason
had
to
earn
the
privilege
of
devoting
himself
exclusively
to
painting
.

Like
many
others
,
he
had
to
work
hard
,
long
hours
in
a
struggling
family
business
which
,
though
it
was
allied
to
art
of
a
kind
--
the
design
and
production
of
engraved
seals
--
bore
no
relation
to
the
painting
of
pictures
.

But
it
did
teach
Roy
the
basic
techniques
of
commercial
art
,
and
later
,
for
twelve
years
,
he
and
his
sister
Nina
conducted
an
advertising
art
studio
in
Philadelphia
.

Except
for
a
rich
friendship
with
the
painter
,
Chauncey
Ryder
who
gave
him
the
only
professional
instruction
he
ever
had
--
and
this
was
limited
to
a
few
lessons
,
though
the
two
artists
often
went
on
painting
trips
together
--
Roy
developed
his
art
by
himself
.

It
has
been
my
privilege
to
paint
with
Roy
Mason
on
numerous
occasions
,
mostly
in
the
vicinity
of
Batavia
.

Inspiring
--
yes
;
;

as
a
result
,
such
pictures
are
only
a
literal
translation
of
what
the
artist
finds
in
the
scene
before
him
.

When
this
occurs
,
I
make
the
change
on
the
sketch
or
on
the
final
watercolor
--
if
I
have
been
working
on
a
full
sheet
in
the
field
.

Then
I
dry
the
sheet
under
mild
pressure
so
that
it
will
lie
flat
as
a
board
.

I
also
use
a
small
electric
hand-blower
to
dry
large
washes
in
the
studio
.

``
My
brushes
are
different
from
those
used
by
most
watercolorists
,
for
I
combine
the
sable
and
the
bristle
.

In
following
this
general
principle
,
Mason
provides
the
observer
with
a
natural
eye
progression
from
foreground
to
background
,
and
the
illusion
of
depth
is
instantly
created
.

When
painting
,
Mason's
physical
eyes
are
half-closed
,
while
his
mind's
eye
is
wide
open
,
and
this
circumstance
accounts
in
part
for
the
impression
he
wishes
to
convey
.

they
universalize
in
terms
of
weather
,
skies
,
earth
,
and
people
.

And
how
very
often
a
water
plane
is
featured
in
his
landscapes
,
and
how
appropriate
that
he
should
appear
in
American
Artist
again
,
in
his
natal
month
of
March
!
!

and
others
in
Buffalo
,
New
York
,
Chautauqua
,
New
Haven
,
Rochester
,
Rockport
,
and
most
recently
,
the
$300
prize
for
a

the
Laguna
Beach
Art
Association

The
Russian
gymnasts
beat
the
tar
out
of
the
American
gymnasts
in
the
1960
Olympics
for
one
reason
--
they
were
better
.

They
were
better
trained
,
better
looking
,
better
built
,
better
disciplined
and
something
else
--
they
were
better
dancers
.

And
is
the
sport
really
important
?
?

The
apparatus
used
by
gymnasts
was
once
a
common
sight
in
American
gyms
,
but
about
1930
it
was
dropped
in
favor
of
games
.

The
gymnast
must
develop
strength
,
flexibility
,
coordination
,
timing
,
rhythm
,
courage
,
discipline
,
persistence
and
the
desire
for
perfection
.

)
In
most
sports
,
as
in
most
walks
of
life
,
the
angels
are
on
the
side
of
those
who
begin
young
,
and
the
Russian
competitor
of
16
has
at
least
thirteen
years
of
training
behind
him
.

Oddly
enough
,
it
is
proven
that
there
would
be
less
reading
difficulty
.

If
the
dance
teachers
of
America
make
it
their
business
to
prepare
their
young
charges
for
the
gymnastics
that
must
come
some
day
if
our
schools
are
really
responsible
,
we
will
be
that
much
ahead
.

School
teachers
,
all
too
unprepared
for
the
job
they
must
do
,
will
need
demonstrators
.

Dancers
do
have
flexibility
.

For
arm
and
shoulder
strength
a
chinning
bar
is
recommended
.

The
horse
kick

Follow
this
by
crossing
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
the
other
on
all
fours
,
kicking
as
high
as
possible
.

As
strength
improves
start
in
a
standing
position
with
legs
wide
apart
and
upper
body
bent
forward
.

Five
of
these
done
daily
for
about
a
week
will
develop
the
strength
for
one
push-up
.

Handstands
come
after
arms
,
chest
and
shoulders
have
developed
at
least
a
minimum
of
strength
.

At
first
each
child
should
do
a
kick-up
by
himself
so
that
the
teacher
can
determine
those
ready
to
work
alone
,
and
those
who
need
help
.

Bare
feet
are
better
for
such
work
than
any
form
of
slipper
.

Backbends

Arch
the
back
upwards
to
make
a
bridge
.

As
flexibility
improves
,
the
feet
will
move
closer
to
the
hands
and
the
bridge
rise
higher
.

Somersaults

The
last
essential
to
the
beginner's
gymnastic
program
is
the
somersault
,
or
forward
roll
.

He
places
the
hands
on
either
side
of
the
head
,
keeping
the
chin
down
on
the
chest
.

then
no
matter
what
happens
,
the
child's
performance
will
be
controlled
.

These
are
beginnings
,
but
correctly
learned
they
prepare
for
satisfying
and
exciting
stunts
that
can
be
performed
by
a
strong
,
flexible
body
(
we
are
not
talking
of
eccentric
extremes
)
.

Electronics
has
been
applied
to
medicine
for
many
years
in
the
form
of
such
familiar
equipment
as
the
x-ray
machine
,
the
electrocardiograph
,
and
the
diathermy
machine
.

Many
cells
,
bacteria
,
and
other
microorganisms
are
transparent
to
visible
light
and
must
be
stained
for
microscopic
investigation
.

These
wavelengths
are
reflected
in
sequence
through
the
specimen
by
the
rotating
mirror
;

The
medical
title
of
``
Lobar
Ventilation
In
Man
''
by
Drs.
C.
J.
Martin
and
A.
C.
Young
,
covers
a
brief
paper
which
is
one
part
of
a
much
larger
effort
to
apply
electronics
to
the
study
of
the
respiratory
process
.

At
the
University
of
Washington
Medical
School
,
the
electronics
group
has
developed
the
``
Respiratory
Gas
Analyzer
''
shown
in
Fig.
3
.

This
unit
,
affectionately
dubbed
``
The
Monster
''
,
can
be
wheeled
to
any
convenient
location
and
provides
a
wealth
of
information
about
the
patient's
breathing
.

In
the
lower
center
rack
an
8-channel
recorder
indicates
the
percentage
of
carbon
dioxide
and
nitrogen
from
the
upper
and
lower
lobes
of
one
lung
,
the
total
volume
of
inhalation
per
breath
,
the
flow
of
air
from
both
lobes
,
and
the
pressure
of
the
two
lobes
with
respect
to
each
other
.

Heart-measuring
techniques

For
many
of
these
measurements
the
chest
must
be
opened
,
but
the
blood
vessels
and
the
heart
itself
remain
undisturbed
.

It
is
also
possible
to
utilize
a
pressure
transducer
,
mounted
at
the
end
of
a
catheter
which
is
inserted
into
the
heart's
left
ventricle
,
to
indicate
the
blood
pressure
in
the
heart
itself
.

A
simplified
version
of
the
instrumentation
for
this
procedure
is
shown
in
Fig.
2
.

Several
years
ago
headlines
were
made
by
a
small
radio
transmitter
capsule
which
could
be
swallowed
by
the
patient
and
which
would
then
radio
internal
pressure
data
to
external
receivers
.

Battery
life
limited
the
use
of
this
``
pill
''
to
about
8
to
30
hours
maximum
.

A
refinement
of
this
technique
has
been
described
by
Drs.
Zworykin
and
Farrar
and
Mr.
Berkely
of
the
Medical
Electronics
Center
of
the
Rockefeller
Institute
.

A
good
example
of
the
results
obtainable
with
ultrasonic
radiation
is
contained
in
papers
presented
by
Dr.
G.
Baum
who
has
explored
the
human
eye
.

He
can
diagnose
detachment
of
the
retina
where
conventional
methods
indicate
blindness
due
to
glaucoma
.

The
method
used
to
scan
the
eye
ultrasonically
is
illustrated
in
Fig.
6
.

Arteries
and
veins
are
apparent
by
their
black
,
blood-filled
centers
and
the
surrounding
white
walls
.

Other
brothers
later
joined
them
for
instruction
with
Oldenburg
,
the
wigmaker
,
and
also
arithmetic
was
added
to
Bible
reading
,
German
,
and
Danish
in
the
informal
curriculum
.

From
the
town
surveyor
,
Hans
learned
drawing
and
mathematics
and
,
from
a
university
student
,
some
academic
subjects
.

Whatever
Hans
or
Anders
learned
separately
they
passed
on
to
each
other
;
;

Ferment
of
scientific
activity

He
was
stirred
by
the
announcement
of
Volta's
discovery
of
chemical
electricity
and
he
immediately
applied
the
voltaic
pile
to
experiments
with
acids
and
alkalis
.

The
following
year
he
devoted
to
the
customary
``
Wanderjahr
''
,
traveling
in
Germany
,
France
,
and
the
Netherlands
,
meeting
the
philosophers
Schelling
,
Fichte
,
and
Tieck
.

As
everybody
is
curious
to
see
the
battery
of
glass
tubes
I
have
invented
,
I
have
had
quite
a
small
one
made
here
of
four
glass
tubes
(
in
Copenhagen
I
used
30
)
and
intend
to
carry
it
with
me
''
.

The
sound
discoveries
of
this
quixotic
genius
were
so
diluted
by
those
of
fantasy
that
the
prize
was
never
awarded
to
him
.

Ritter
proceeded
,
``
You
now
emerge
into
a
new
epoch
in
which
late
in
the
year
1819
or
1820
,
you
will
have
to
reckon
.

Ritter
died
in
1810
and
Oersted
not
only
lived
to
see
the
event
occur
but
was
the
author
of
it
.

In
1800
,
Manthey
went
abroad
and
Oersted
was
appointed
manager
of
the
Lion
Pharmacy
.

The
years
1812
and
1813
saw
him
in
Germany
and
France
again
,
but
on
this
visit
to
Berlin
he
did
not
seek
out
the
philosophers
as
he
had
on
his
first
journey
.

The
form
of
galvanic
activity
is
halfway
between
the
magnetic
form
and
the
electrical
form
.

It
is
also
found
that
magnetism
exists
in
all
bodies
of
nature
,
as
proven
by
Bruckmann
and
Coulomb
.

Oersted
returned
in
1814
and
resumed
an
active
part
in
university
and
political
discussions
.

Discovery
of
electromagnetism

In
the
late
1700's
Beccaria
and
Van
Marum
,
among
others
,
had
magnetized
iron
by
sending
an
electrostatic
charge
through
it
.

Beccaria
had
almost
stumbled
on
a
lead
to
the
relationship
between
electricity
and
magnetism
when
a
discharge
from
a
Leyden
jar
was
sent
transversally
through
a
piece
of
watch-spring
steel
making
its
ends
magnetic
.

The
resulting
magnetic
effect
proved
stronger
than
when
the
discharge
was
made
lengthwise
.

The
sequence
of
events
leading
to
his
important
discovery
still
remains
ambiguous
but
it
seems
that
one
of
the
advanced
students
at
the
university
related
that
the
first
direct
event
that
led
to
the
publication
of
Oersted's
discovery
occurred
during
a
private
lecture
made
before
a
group
of
other
advanced
students
in
the
spring
of
1820
.

Greater

Need
for
service
is
here
to
stay
--
and
the
problem
is
going
to
be
tougher
to
solve
in
the
sixties
.

Providing
good
customer
service
requires
as
thorough
a
marketing
and
general
management
planning
job
as
the
original
selling
of
the
product
.

Good
service
starts
with
product
design
and
planning
:
Many
products
seem
to
be
designed
for
a
production
economy
,
not
for
a
service
one
.

Your
competition
is
now
proportionately
greater
--
you
are
competing
not
only
against
manufacturers
in
the
same
field
but
also
against
a
vast
array
of
manufacturers
of
other
appealing
consumer
products
.

These
shifts
will
continue
in
the
next
10
yrs.
.

Have
you
considered
the
implications
of
continuing
geographic
shifts
in
terms

Problems
in
marketing
management

While
many
companies
have
done
fine
work
in
developing
sales
personnel
,
much
of
it
has
been
product
rather
than
sales
training
.

Most
marketing
people
agree
it
is
going
to
take
redoubled
efforts
to
satisfy
future
requirements
.

Men
qualified
for
the
broader
task
of
marketing
manager
are
even
more
scarce
due
to
the
demanding
combination
of
qualifications
called
for
by
this
type
of
management
work
.

Many
food
and
beverage
companies
are
already
on
a
highly
planned
basis
.

Are
planning
and
strategy
development
emphasized
sufficiently
in
your
company
?
?

We
find
too
many
sales
and
marketing
executives
so
burdened
with
detail
that
they
are
short-changing
planning
.

Are
annual
marketing
plans
reviewed
throughout
your
management
group
to
get
the
perspective
of
all
individuals
and
get
everyone
on
the
marketing
team
?
?

If
companies
will
take
the
time
to
give
objective
consideration
to
their
major
problems
and
to
the
questions
they
provoke
,
then
a
long
constructive
step
will
have
been
taken
toward
more
effective
marketing
in
next
decade
.

It
is
true
that
most
architectural
schools
have
five
year
courses
,
some
even
have
six
or
more
.

In
addition
to
this
the
U.
S.
Civil
Service
Bureau
,
when
examining
applicants
for
government
positions
as
interior
designers
,
expects
that
``
when
various
needed
objects
are
not
obtainable
on
the
market
he
will
design
them
.

Yet
nobody
will
question
the
necessity
of
all
this
and
any
reputable
interior
designer
does
know
all
this
and
does
practice
it
.

as
in
a
recent
design
competition
with
a
floor
plan
and
the
simple
command
--
``
design
a
luxury
apartment
''
;
;

It
is
possible
,
of
course
,
to
work
on
extant
or
projected
buildings
where
either
architect
or
owner
will
explain
their
necessities
so
that
the
student
may
get
``
the
feel
''
of
real
interior
design
demands
.

In
the
earlier
years
of
training
certain
phases
of
the
work
must
be
covered
and
the
synthetic
problem
has
its
use
.

Consultation
with
architects
,
clients
,
real
estate
men
,
fabric
houses
and
furniture
companies
is
essential
to
the
proper
development
of
class
problems
just
as
in
actual
work
.

Fortunately
,
although
only
a
few
years
ago
they
held
the
student
at
arms
length
,
today
the
business
houses
welcome
the
opportunity
to
aid
the
student
,
not
only
from
an
increased
sense
of
community
responsibility
but
also
from
the
realization
that
the
student
of
today
is
the
interior
designer
of
tomorrow
--
that
the
student
already
is
``
in
the
trade
''
.

It
is
discouraging
for
students
to
realize
that
the
societies
do
not
truly
uphold
the
standards
for
which
they
are
supposed
to
stand
.

No
one
can
deny
that
these
``
back
door
''
admissions
to
membership
provisions
have
been
seriously
abused
nor
that
they
have
not
resulted
in
the
admission
of
downright
incompetents
to
membership
in
supposedly
learned
societies
.

Only
a
few
years
ago
a
middle
western
college
circulated
a
request
for
a
teacher
of
interior
design
.

We
must
build
a
corps
of
highly
professional
teachers
of
interior
design
who
have
had
education
,
experience
in
the
profession
and
are
willing
to
take
on
the
usual
accompaniments
of
teaching
--
minimal
income
and
minimal
status
among
their
confreres
.

For
proper
accreditation
of
schools
,
teachers
in
any
course
must
have
a
degree
at
least
one
level
above
that
for
which
the
student
is
a
candidate
.

The
question
,
however
,
cannot
be
ignored
for
long
.

This
,
plus
the
habit
of
many
schools
of
simply
adding
interior
design
to
the
many
subjects
of
their
home
economics
department
,
yet
,
nevertheless
,
claiming
that
they
teach
interior
design
,
has
contributed
to
the
low
repute
of
many
university
courses
in
interior
design
.

In
spite
of
this
,
many
universities
offer
adequate
and
even
distinguished
courses
in
the
subject
.

Do
you
measure
its
relation
to
reduced
absenteeism
,
turnover
,
accidents
,
and
grievances
,
and
to
improved
quality
and
output
?
?

Is
it
reaching
these
goals
?
?

Are
you
using
the
most
economical
printing
methods
,
paper
,
etc.
.

Can
you
consider
restricting
any
additional
employee
benefits
to
those
paid
for
by
profit-sharing
money
,
such
as
was
done
in
the
union
contract
recently
signed
by
American
Motors
Corporation
?
?

Do
you
try
to
maintain
the
principle
of
employee-contributed
(
as
opposed
to
fully
company-paid
)
programs
?
?

Would
it
be
feasible
to
limit
the
menu
in
order
to
reduce
feeding
costs
?
?

Have
you
considered
gradual
withdrawal
of
subsidies
to
your
in-plant
feeding
operation
?
?

Paid
vacations

Which
is
more
economical
for
your
plant
--
a
vacation
shutdown
or
spaced
vacations
that
require
extra
employees
for
vacation
fill-ins
?
?

Would
early
retirement
of
non-productive
,
disabled
employees
reduce
the
number
of
make-work
jobs
?
?

Can
you
share
medical
facilities
and
staff
with
neighboring
plants
?
?

Are
you
indiscriminantly
offering
unnecessary
medical
services
--
flu
shots
,
sun
lamp
treatments
,
etc.
?
?

If
you
have
an
annual
or
regular
physical
examination
program
,
is
it
worth
what
it
is
costing
you
?
?

A
program
to
fit
your
needs

What's
your
profit
margin
?
?

Aim
to
balance
your
employee
benefit
package
.

This
can
be
done
by
stories
in
your
house
organs
,
posters
,
special
publications
,
letters
to
workers'
homes
as
well
as
by
word
of
mouth
through
your
chain
of
command
.

Insurance

You
may
find
certain
coverage
costing
much
more
than
is
economically
feasible
,
thereby
alerting
you
to
desirable
revisions
.

Coffee
breaks
can
be
a
real
headache
if
not
regulated
.

Keep
the
retirement
age
flexible
so
skilled
craftsmen
such
as
tool
and
die
makers
can
be
kept
on
the
job
for
the
convenience
of
the
company
.

Require
each
employee
to
work
his
last
shift
both
before
and
after
the
holiday
to
be
eligible
for
pay
.

This
cuts
the
absentee
rate
.

As
the
generations
move
on
,
clothes
become
more
suitable
for
the
enjoyment
of
outdoor
sports
.

The
American
firearms
and
ammunition
manufacturers
through
diligent
research
and
technical
development
have
replaced
the
muzzle
loader
and
slow-firing
single-shot
arms
with
modern
fast
firing
auto-loaders
,
extremely
accurate
bolt
,
lever
,
and
slide
action
firearms
.

Close
to
two
million
game
birds
were
harvested
on
1,500
commercial
and
private
shooting
preserves
,
and
on
State
Game
Commission-controlled
upland
game
areas
during
the
1960-61
season
.

The
shooting
development
program
of
the
Sporting
Arms
and
Ammunition
Manufacturers'
Institute
has
successfully
published
these
facts
in
all
major
outdoor
magazines
,
many
national
weeklies
and
the
trade
papers
.

The
group
known
as
the
American
Association
for
Health
,
,
Physical
Education
,
and
Recreation
(
a
division
of
the
National
Education
Association
)
initiated
a
conference
which
brought
together
representatives
of
the
National
Rifle
Association
,
SAAMI
and
the
American
Fishing
Tackle
Manufacturers
.

This
meeting
was
called
to
determine
how
these
groups
might
cooperate
to
launch
what
is
known
as
the
Outdoor
Education
Project
.

This
program
is
now
nationally
known
as
``
Teen
Hunter
Clubs
''
.

Other
pilot
programs
were
conducted
by
A
&
S
,
Babylon
,
New
York
;
;

The
continuation
and
expansion
of
the
shooting
development
program
will
assure
to
some
degree
that
national
and
community
leaders
will
be
made
aware
of
the
ever-growing
need
for
shooting
facilities
and
activities
for
hunting
and
shooting
in
answer
to
public
demand
.

While
individual
sportsmen
are
aware
of
this
situation
,
too
many
of
our
political
,
social
,
educational
and
even
religious
leaders
too
often
forget
it
.

Help
is
needed
from
dealers
,
at
the
grass-roots
level
.

This
beach
campground
with
no
trees
or
hills
presents
a
constant
camping
show
with
all
manner
of

There
were
umbrella
tents
,
wall
tents
,
cottage
tents
,
station
wagon
tents
,
pup
tents
,
Pop

,
Baker

tents
with
exterior

,
camper
trailers
,
travel
trailers
,
and
even
a
few
surplus
parachutes
serving
as
sunshades
over
entire
family
camps
.

Moving
around
camp
we
saw
all
kinds
of
camp
stoves
,
lanterns
,
coolers
,
bedding
,
games
,
fishing
tackle
,
windbreaks
and
sunshades
.

Dealers
would
do
well
to
visit
such
a
campground
often
,
look
at
the
equipment
and
talk
with
the
campers
.

You
read
various
guesses
on
how
many
Americans
are
camping
.

The
National
Parks
,
always
popular
camping
places
,
are
facing
the
same
pressure

U.S.
Forest
Service

thousands
of
campers
in
its
149
National
Forests
and
is
increasing
its
facilities
steadily
.

They
bring
their
fishing
rods
and
binoculars
and
bathing
suits
.

But
make
no
mistake
about
it
,
the
first
reason
people
turn
to
camping
is
one
of
economy
.

Where
Americans
used
to
think
of
a
single
vacation
each
summer
,
they
now
think
about
how
many
vacations
they
can
have
.

It
would
be
a
mistake
to
sell
those
thousands
of
beginning
campers
on
the
idea
they're
buying
the
comforts
of
home
.

Since
the
Industrial
Revolution
,
when
factories
emerged
,
this
classical
pattern
has
been
followed
.

It
is
,
as
one
engineer
says
,
``
indeed
a
difficult
thing
for
the
engineer
to
accept
that
he
can
go
as
far
on
his
technical
merit
as
he
could
employing
managerial
skills
.

there
is
no
one
point
in
a
man's
career
at
which
he
must
select
either
the
technical
or
the
managerial
path
upward
.

in

,
for
a
long
period
vp

gm
of
the
Measurements

Division

and
who
currently
,
approaching
retirement
,
is

and
consulting
engineer
in
the
Switchgear
&
Control
Division
.

Senior
Physicist
.

Westinghouse
has
a
similar
system
,
with
two
classifications
representing
various
levels
of
competence
on
the
strictly
technical
side
:
consulting
engineer
or
scientist
,
as
the
case
may
be
,
and
advisory
engineer
or
scientist
.

Many
companies
have
systems
,
particularly
in
R
&
D
,
which
work
more
or
less
well
,
depending
upon
size
and
actual
belief
in
the
policy
on
the
part
of
administration
,
as
will
be
abundantly
apparent
in
subsequent
quotations
.

Senior
staff

?
?

The
expectation
is
that
first-level
supervisors
will
be
selected
in
approximately
equal
numbers
from
the
second
and
third
engineering
level
,
with
very
few
coming
from
the
first
level
.

One
way
to
formalize
this
is
in
the
job
structure
.

``
Above
these
jobs
we
have
chief
engineer
for
the
company
and
vice-president
of
Engrg
,
R
&
Aj
.

``
.

The
primary
deterrent
appears
to
lie
with
the
technical
people
themselves
,
and
their
concept
of
what
constitutes
status
in
present-day
society
.

Scientists
who
agitate
hardest
for
technical
recognition
are
often
the
most
reluctant
to
accept
it
.

``
We
also
do
a
number
of
things
to
build
up
the
prestige
of
the
engineer
as
a
'
professional
'
and
also
to
give
public
recognition
to
individual
technical
competence
.

We
have
two
media
for
publicizing
individual
technical
activity
,
a
magazine
widely
distributed
both
within
and
without
the
company
,
and
an
information
bulletin
for
engineering
personnel
distributed
to
the
homes
of
all
engineers
.

``
A
recent
,
and
more
pertinent
action
,
has
been
the
establishment
of
a
technical
staff
reporting
to
the
vice-president
for
Engineering
.

This
function
is
staffed
by
engineers
chosen
for
their
technical
competence
and
who
have
the
title
,
member
of
the
technical
staff
.

``
We
presently
are
involved
in
inaugurating
a
new
development
center
.

Vice-president
is
Louis
Berkman
and
the
secretary-treasurer
is
Mark
Ritter
.

Not
a
year
goes
by
but
what
several
local
companies
in
the
U.S.
and
Canada
,
even
overseas
,
write
to
Fueloil
&
Oil
Heat
to
inquire
if
it's
feasible
and
where
it
is
being
done
.

As
a
result
of
that
attitude
,
others
have
been
discouraged
from
trying
central
distribution
.

Called
a
``
Slo-Flo
''
meter
it
was
designed
for
this
job
by
Power
Plus
Industries
of
Los
Angeles
,
a
key
individual
being
Don
Nelson
.

To
overcome
this
,
the
builder
lays
and
completes
the
street
himself
,
then
deeds
it
to
the
community
while
retaining
a
perpetual
easement
for
the
oil
lines
.

How
does
Tri-State
get
its
revenue
from
this
plan
?
?

The
major
gets
the
assured
gallonage
for
the
life
of
the
lease
and
the
distributor
apparently
can
do
well
because
delivery
cost
is
low
.

The
Public
Service
Commission
has
ruled
that
this
is
not
a
public
utility
,
subject
to
their
many
regulations
.

They
like
it
and
would
supply
most
of
the
capital
because
of
the
long
term
leases
by
strong
oil
companies
.

They
are
laid
a
minimum
of
24''
''
deep
and
in
some
areas
four
feet
down
,
particularly
under
roads
,
to
stay
clear
of
all
other
piping
such
as
water
and
sewers
and
to
minimize
shocks
from
heavy
trucking
.

The
meter
is
mounted
high
on
the
basement
wall
.

Its
figures
are
a
half
inch
high
and
very
easy
to
read
,
even
into
tenth
gallons
.

It
may
also
work
in
one
other
way
--
by
licensing
its
system
patents
and
supplying
the
meters
,
letting
the
oil
company
or
even
the
builder
install
the
facilities
.

The
big

Designers
of
signs
and
displays
have
shown
a
refreshing
approach
to
the
adaptation
of
plastics
that
has
influenced
the
workings
of
other
industries
.

Many
of
today's
developments
in
thermoforming
stem
from
original
work
done
with
signs
and
displays
;
;

the
art
of
preprinting
in
distortion
was
similarly
perfected
by
the
sign
makers
;
;

Five
years
ago
,
they
had
only
10%
of
the
market
,
with
the
remainder
firmly
entrenched
in
the
stronghold
of
neon
tubing
.

Currently
,
there
are
some
6000
companies
in
the
field
,
ranging
from
small
firms
with
a
handful
of
employees
to
major
concerns
having
complete
facilities
for
production
of
metal
,
electrical
,
and
plastic
components
.

Out
of
many
factors
which
might
be
cited
,
five
are
most
important
:
1
.

Plastic
signs
are
economical
.

According
to
one
major
producer
,
materials
for
a
typical
plastic
sign
are
approximately
25%
less
costly
than
for
a
comparable
neon
unit
.

The
lighter
weight
also
means
less
costly
supports
and
mountings
are
needed
.

Internal
illumination
,
protected
from
the
elements
,
gives
them
powerful
visual
appeal
at
night
;
;

5
.

Advances
in
equipment
and
fabrication
techniques
give
the
sign
or
display
manufacturer
an
extremely
wide
choice
of
production
techniques
,
ranging
from
injection
molding
for
intricate
,
smaller-size
,
mass-production
signs
(
generally
5000
units
is
the
minimum
)
to
vacuum
and
pressure
forming
for
larger
signs
of
limited
runs
.

At
present
,
both
the
familiar
cast
acrylic
and
the
newer
extruded
sheets
are
being
used
by
sign
manufacturers
,
with
extruded
now
representing
an
estimated
10%
of
the
total
.

Trans-illuminated
billboards

One
of
the
most
significant
advancements
in
design
of
plastics
signs
is
the
so-called
trans-illuminated
billboard
,
now
being
produced
by
several
large
sign
manufacturers
such
as
Advance
Neon
Sign
Co.
,
Los
Angeles
,
and
Industrial
Electric
Inc.
,
New
Orleans
,
La.
.

new
panels
are
exchanged
for
the
old
right
in
the
field
on
a
single
trip
.

As
used
by
Industrial
Electric
Inc.
,
the
film
panels
are
printed
one
at
a
time
,
as
are
24-sheet
posters
.

Thus
the
film
can
be
applied
to
back-lighted
translucent
plastics
faces
;
;

they
can
also
be
applied
to
opaque
panels
for
use
on
cutouts
,
or
they
can
be
applied
directly
to
painted
bulletin
faces
.

In
this
way
,
the
sign
maker
has
an
economical
means
for
displaying
uniform
copy
on
different
sign
media
.

Recently
Industrial
Electric
unveiled
another
new
development
made
possible
by
modern
plastic
materials
--
a
revolving
spectacular
sign
.

The
background
,
which
is
available
in
various
widths
and
continuous
lengths
,
is
extruded
with
parallel
undercut
grooves
which
grip
the
flexible
letters
securely
.

letters
molded
of
butyrate
,
available
in
several
sizes

or
black
.

Wagner

example
,
supplies
them
in
several
colors

in
heights
of

,

,
and
17
inches

clear
butyrate
sheet
stock
,
masked
and
sprayed
on
the
rear
side
.

On
large-area
units
,
where
additional
structural
requirements
are
imposed
,
one
recent
approach
utilizes
modular
extruded
or
formed
channels
(
e.g.
right-angled
corrugations
)
of
the
acrylic
or
butyrate
.

It
changes
the
answers
on
when
to
do
what
at
the
site
.

Instead
of
closing
the
house
in
first
(
as
most
builders
do
)
you
can
now
cut
your
costs
by
not
closing
it
in
until
you
have
to
(
see
p
121
)
.

It
changes
the
answers
on
builder-dealer
relations
.

Not
so
long
ago
many
builders
were
finding
they
could
cut
their
costs
by
``
buying
direct
''
and
short-cutting
the
dealer
.

``
Only
one
lumber
dealer
in
ten
is
equipped
to
handle
unit
loads
;
;

``
That
House
&
Home
Round
Table
was
the
real
starting
point
for
today's
revolution
in
materials
handling
''
,
says
Clarence
Thompson
,
long
chairman
of
the
Lumber
Dealers'
Research
Council
.

``
It
made
our
whole
industry
recognize
the
need
for
a
new
kind
of
teamwork
between
manufacturer
,
carrier
,
equipment
maker
,
dealer
,
and
builder
,
all
working
together
to
cut
the
cost
of
materials
handling
.

``
With
a
15,500-lb.
fork-lift
,
dealers
can
unload
unitized
lumber
from
wide-door
box
cars
for
compared
with
$1.65
or
more
to
unload
loose
lumber
one
piece
at
a
time
''
,
says
James
Wright
of
Aj
.

5
.

Lumber
dealers
and
lumber
manufacturers
have
agreed
on
a
standard
unit
for
unitized
shipments
--
48''
''
wide
by
a
nominal
30''
''
high
(
or
six
McCracken
packets
24''
''
wide
by
nominal
7''
''
high
)
.

These
units
make
it
easy
to
load
as
much
as
48,000
(
say
120,000
lb
in
a
50'
box
car
)
much
more
than
the
average
for
loose-loaded
cars
.

Says
NRLDA's
James
Wright
:
``
Since
1958
carriers
that
move
material
from
the
yard
to
the
job
site
have
undergone
more
radical
changes
than
any
of
the
dealer's
other
equipment
''
.

The
reason
:
today's
components
and
lumber
packages
are
far
too
bulky
to
be
handled
by
a
truckdriver
and
a
helper
.

And
it
helps
the
builder
because
it
can
handle
a
more
efficiently
packaged
load
,
can
deliver
it
to
the
best
spot
(
in
some
cases
,
right
on
the
roof
or
inside
the
house
)
,
and
never
takes
any
of
the
builder's
high-priced
labor
to
help
unload
it
.

A
midwestern
builder
cut
his
labor
costs
per
thousand
bricks
from
$81
to
$43.50
by
adopting
this
same
process
,
cut
them
another
$7.50
to
$36
by
buying
his
bricks
in
convenient
,
easy-to-spot
100-brick
packages
.

We
found
that
wherever
you
can
use
two
teams
on
a
job
,
five
men
,
not
four
,
is
the
magic
number
''
.

Green
lumber
was
all
very
well
back
in
the
days
of
wet
plaster
,
when
the
framing
lumber
was
bound
to
swell
and
then
shrink
as
tons
of
water
dried
out
the
gypsum
.

Green
studs
cost
about
$.65
;
;

Following
a
guide
,
and
gratefully
so
,
is
an
excellent
way
to
see
all
the
important
places
when
everything
is
strange
and
new
.

For
those
who
need
or
want
and
can
afford
another
car
,
buying
one
and
driving
it
on
the
grand
tour
,
then
shipping
it
home
,
is
one
popular
plan
for
a
do-it-yourself
pilgrimage
.

The
answer
to
this
diathesis
is
to
pick
up
a
telephone
and
arrange
to
rent
one
.

Almost
any
travel
agent
will
reserve
a
car
for
you
.

You
can
call
one
of
the
car
rental
services
directly
(
Hertz
,
Avis
,
Auto-Europe
Nationalcar
Rental
,
and
others
)
and
ask
them
to
reserve
a
car
of
your
choice
,
and
some
transportation
lines
offer
this
service
as
well
.

You
can
wait
,
of
course
,
until
you
arrive
in
Europe
before
renting
your
car
.

The
disadvantages
to
this
method
are
that
you
may
not
have
as
great
a
choice
of
models
readily
available
or
you
may
have
to
wait
a
few
days
or
,
during
the
busy
tourist
season
,
when
cars
are
in
great
demand
,
you
might
find
it
fairly
difficult
to
get
a
car
at
all
.

Quite
naturally
,
there
is
a
greater
availability
of
those
models
which
are
manufactured
within
a
specific
country
.

If
you
would
like
to
start
your
tour
in
Italy
,
where
the
rental
fees
are
actually
the
lowest
in
Europe
,
Fiats
in
all
sizes
are
available
,
as
are
Alfa
Romeo
Giulietta
models
.

Rates
for
American
cars
are
somewhat
higher
,
ranging
from
about
$8.00
a
day
up
to
$14.00
a
day
for
a
Chevrolet
Convertible
,
but
the
rate
per
kilometer
driven
is
roughly
the
same
as
for
the
larger
European
models
.

You
will
be
entitled
to
all
the
advantages
of
a
new
car
owner
,
which
includes
the
factory
guarantee
and
the
services
valid
at
authorized
dealers
throughout
Europe
.

Leasing
a
car
is
not
as
common
or
as
popular
as
renting
a
car
in
Europe
,
but
for
long
periods
it
will
be
unquestionably
more
economical
and
satisfactory
.

It
isn't
as
expensive
as
most
people
believe
it
to
be
.

Since
most
European
cars
average
more
miles
per
gallon
of
gasoline
than
American
cars
,
it
naturally
follows
that
the
cost
per
kilometer
for
these
models
will
be
less
,
but
the
greater
seating
capacity
of
the
large
American
cars
will
equalize
this
,
provided
your
group
is
sufficiently
large
to
fill
a
7-passenger
limousine
.

However
,
whether
you
arrange
to
have
a
European
or
American
model
,
if
you
rent
a
car
with
the
proper
seating
capacity
in
relation
to
the
number
of
people
in
your
party
,
your
transportation
expense
will
average
very
close
to
$10.00
per
day
per
passenger
.

And
the
drawling
,
oversoft
voice
of
flirtation
,
though
fairly
overt
,
was
still
well
within
the
prescribed
gambit
of
their
culture
.

In
other
words
,
like
automation
machines
designed
to
work
in
tandem
,
they
shared
the
same
programming
,
a
mutual
understanding
not
only
of
English
words
,
but
of
the
four
stresses
,
pitches
,
and
junctures
that
can
change
their
meaning

to
white
.

At
this
point
,
unfortunately
,
romance
becomes
a
regrettably
small
part
of
the
picture
;
;

Smith's
first
workout
with
stresses
,
pitches
,
and
junctures
was
based
on
mother
,
which
spells
,
in
our
culture
,
a
good
deal
more
than
bread
alone
.

Newest
to
this
high-powered
battery
are
the
experts
in
linguistics
who
have
carried
that
minimum
to
a
new
level
.

or
surprise
,
which
would
set
the
patient
apart
from
other
people
.

The
patient
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
far
from
neutral
;
;

He
may
then
very
well
conclude
that
``
everybody
''
is
probably
not
the
true
target
of
her
resentment
.

She
says
later
,
but
still
within
the
opening
five
minutes
,
``
I
keep
thinking
of
a
divorce
but
that's
another
emotional
death
''
.

Throughout
the
early
years
of
World
War
2
,
,
reports
persisted
that
the
Axis
powers
had
used
gas
--
Germany
in
Russia
,
Japan
in
China
again
.

Influential
people
in
America
were
warning
the
Pentagon
to
be
prepared
against
desperation
gas
attacks
by
the
Germans
in
future
campaigns
.

A
detachment
of
six
men
from
the
701st
Chemical
Maintenance
Company
under
First
Lt.
Howard
D.
Beckstrom
went
aboard
,
followed
by
Lt.
Thomas
H.
Richardson
,
the
Cargo
Security
Officer
.

No
one
else
must
know
.

On
November
24th
,
they
had
made
a
raid
on
La
Maddalena
.

Telephone
communication
was
bad
.

And
everywhere
in
evidence
among
the
few
remaining
defensive
units
was
that
old
handmaiden
of
disaster
--
multiple
command
.

``
This
harbor
is
a
bomber's
paradise
''
,
the
Britisher
had
said
with
frank
grimness
.

Like
hell
he'd
wait
--
and
supposing
the
radar-controlled
gun
got
knocked
out
?
?

Below
decks
,
Seaman
Stanley
Bishop
had
begun
to
write
a
letter
home
.

Above
decks
on
the
John
Harvey
,
Lieutenant
Richardson
gazed
at
the
lights
still
burning
on
the
port
wall
and
felt
uneasy
.

He
hoped
they
would
put
in
somewhere
way
,
way
down
in
the
earth
.

Richardson
had
returned
their
departing
grins
with
the
noncommittal
nod
that
is
the
security
officer's
stock
in
trade
.

Damned
if
that
wasn't
a
sailing
ship
standing
out
of
the
old
harbor
--
Porto
Vecchio
.

Then
the
thought
of
a
cloudless
sky
made
him
shiver
,
and
he
glanced
upward
.

Captain
Musmanno's
renovated
schooner
with
the
flamboyant
name
Unsinkable
had
just
left
Porto
Vecchio
with
a
cargo
of
badly-needed
olive
oil
for
the
Sorrentine's
civilian
population
.

It
was
the
silver
foil
from
the
chocolate
bar
he
had
been
eating
.

It
was
not
candy
wrapping
.

They
had
winged
over
the
Adriatic
,
they
had
taken
Bari
by
complete
surprise
and
now
they
were
battering
her
,
attacking
with
deadly
skill
.

After
the
first
two
were
blacked
out
,
the
third
light
was
abandoned
by
a
terrified
Italian
crew
,
who
left
their
light
to
shine
for
nine
minutes
like
an
unerring
homing
beacon
until
British
MP's
shot
it
out
.

John
Bascom
went
down
early
,
too
.

Now
the
Bascom
was
mortally
wounded
.

There
is
a
pause
in
the
merriment
as
your
friends
gaze
at
you
,
wondering
why
you
are
staring
,
open-mouthed
in
amazement
.

Dreams
present
many
mysteries
of
telepathy
,
clairvoyance
,
prevision
and
retrovision
.

The
question
becomes
,
``
What
is
a
dream
''
?
?

In
most
cases
we
recognize
certain
words
,
persons
,
animals
or
objects
.

For
instance
,
the
dreamer
sees
himself
seated
behind
neighbor
Smith
and
,
with
photographic
realism
,
sees
Smith
driving
the
car
;
;

Dreams
that
display
events
of
the
future
with
photographic
detail
call
for
a
theory
explaining
their
basic
mystery
and
all
its
components
,
including
that
weird
feeling
of
deja
vue
,
inevitably
fantastic
though
that
theory
must
seem
.

The
opening
paragraph
of
the
chapter
titled
The
Theory
Of
Representative
Perception
,
in
the
book
Philosophies
Of
Science
by
Albert
G.
Ramsperger
says
,
``
passed
on
to
the
brain
,
and
there
,
by
some
unexplained
process
,
it
causes
the
mind
to
have
a
perception
''
.

As
retinal
images
are
conceded
to
be
an
integral
function
of
the
brain
it
seems
logical
to
suppose
that
the
nerves
,
between
the
inner
brain
and
the
eyes
,
carry
the
direct
drive
for
cooperation
from
the
various
brain
centers
--
rather
than
to
theorize
on
the
transmission
of
an
image
which
is
already
in
required
location
.

Modern
physics
has
developed
the
theory
that
all
matter
consists
of
minute
waves
of
energy
.

So
we
may
conceive
the
coexistence
of
the
infinite
number
of
universal
,
apparently
momentary
states
of
matter
,
successive
one
after
another
in
consciousness
,
but
permanent
each
on
its
own
basic
phase
of
the
progressive
frequencies
.

He
was
almost
positive
it
was
not
Assyrian
nor
Cassite
,
and
imagined
it
must
have
been
German
or
English
.

That
the
dream
was
a
reality
on
the
infinite
progressions
of
universal
,
gradient
frequencies
,
across
which
the
modern
professor
and
the
priest
of
ancient
Nippur
met
?
?

No
doubt
some
experiences
vanish
so
completely
as
to
leave
no
trace
on
the
sleeper's
mind
.

``
The
food
is
wonderful
and
it
is
a
lot
of
fun
to
be
here
''
!
!

So
wrote
a
ten
year
old
student
in
a
letter
to
his
parents
from
North
Country
School
,
Lake
Placid
,
New
York
.

The
school
has
always
maintained
a
farm
to
supply
the
needs
of
the
school
.

In
a
climate
hostile
to
agriculture
,
Mr.
Clark
has
had
to
keep
alert
to
the
most
productive
farm
techniques
.

Mr.
Clark
found
that
orthodox
procedures
of
deep
plowing
,
use
of
chemical
fertilizers
and
insecticides
,
plus
the
application
of
conservation
principles
of
rotation
and
contouring
,
did
not
prevent
sheet
erosion
in
the
potato
fields
and
depreciation
of
the
soil
.

By
1952
he
was
convinced
he
would
no
longer
spray
.

Separate
pails
were
kept
in
the
kitchen
for
coffee
grounds
and
egg
shells
.

It
was
applied
with
a
compost
shredder
made
from
a
converted
manure
spreader
.

Sniffing
its
sweet
smell
and
letting
it
fall
to
show
its
good
crumbly
consistency
,
he
pointed
to
the
nearby
driveway
and
said
,
``
This
soil
used
to
be
like
that
hard
packed
road
over
there
''
.

``
After
the
soil
,
the
kitchen
''
,
says
Mr.
Clark
.

Then
Miss
Lillian
Colman
came
from
Vermont
to
be
kitchen
manager
.

Today
whole
grains
are
freshly
ground
every
day
and
baked
into
bread
.

Mr.
Clark's
studies
taught
him
that
the
only
way
to
conserve
the
vitamins
in
the
whole
grain
was
prompt
use
of
the
flour
.

Miss
Colman
pours
measures
of
whole
wheat
,
oats
,
and
soy
beans
and
turns
on
the
motor
.

When
they
leave
for
vacations
they
miss
the
hot
cereal
.

Where
can
we
get
this
cereal
he
likes
so
much
''
?
?

Salads
are
served
at
least
once
a
day
.

Oranges
and
grapefruit
are
shipped
from
Florida
weekly
from
an
organic
farm
.

Raw
wheat-germ
is
available
on
the
breakfast
table
for
the
children
to
help
themselves
.

Drinking
with
meals
is
also
discouraged
;
;

The
source
is
known
so
there
is
no
necessity
to
remove
insecticide
residues
.

Wholesome
snacks
,
no
candy

To
solve
the
problem
of
the
wheat
grains
spilling
on
the
floor
and
getting
underfoot
,
a
ball
of
maple
syrup
boiled
to
candy
consistency
was
invented
to
hold
the
grains
.

They
learn
to
like
these
so
well
that
it
isn't
surprising
to
hear
that
one
boy
tried
the
oats
he
was
feeding
his
horse
at
chore
time
.

They
tasted
good
to
him
,
so
he
brought
some
to
breakfast
to
eat
in
his
cereal
bowl
with
milk
and
honey
.

The
heavy
meal
comes
in
the
middle
of
the
day
.

The
school
finds
that
the
children
are
satisfied
with
smaller
amounts
of
food
since
all
of
it
is
high
in
quality
.

Outdoor
exercises

The
ruddy
complexion
of
the
faces
also
brings
comment
.

The
girders
of
a
shattered
Dog
River
bridge
lay
strewn
for
half
a
mile
downstream
.

Rain
of
near
cloudburst
proportions
had
fallen
for
three
full
days
and
it
was
still
raining
on
the
morning
of
Friday
,
November
4
,
1927
,
when
officials
of
the
Post
Office
Department's
Railway
Mail
Service
realized
that
their
distribution
system
for
Vermont
had
been
almost
totally
destroyed
overnight
.

The
state's
railroad
system
counted
miles
of
broken
bridges
and
missing
rights-of-way
:
it
would
obviously
remain
out
of
commission
for
weeks
.

The
nearest
undisrupted
end
of
track
from
Boston
was
at
Concord
,
N.
H.
.

When
Governor
Al
Smith
offered
New
York
National
Guard
planes
to
fly
the
mail
in
and
out
of
the
state
,
it
seemed
a
likely
temporary
solution
,
easing
Burlington's
bottleneck
and
that
at
Montpelier
too
.

His
work
began
just
six
days
after
the
flood
.

It
took
a
tragedy
to
bring
things
to
a
head
.

With
the
field
a
blur
of
white
the
unfortunate
pilot
had
simply
flown
into
the
hillside
.

Faced
with
this
situation
,
Postmaster
Charles
F.
McKenna
of
Montpelier
went
with
Fogg
on
a
Burlington
trip
,
and
together
they
scouted
the
terrain
on
the
heights
of
Berlin
.

Each
trip
saw
the
front
cockpit
filled
higher
with
mail
pouches
.

A
sheep-lined
leather
flying
suit
,
plus
helmet
,
goggles
and
mittens
completed
his
attire
for
the
rigors
of
the
open
cockpit
.

``
Ceilings
''
were
judged
by
comparison
with
known
mountain
heights
and
cloud
positions
.

)
Wishing
to
show
that
aviation
was
dependable
and
here
to
stay
,
Bob
Fogg
always
made
a
point
of
taking
off
each
morning
on
the
dot
of
seven
,
disregarding
rain
,
snow
and
sleet
in
true
postal
tradition
.

Bob
Fogg
didn't
have
today's
advantages
of
Instrument
Flight
and
Ground
Control
Approach
systems
.

At
Fort
Ethan
Allen
the
ever-present
wind
off
Lake
Champlain
could
readily
flip
a
puny
man-made
thing
like
an
airplane
if
the
pilot
miscalculated
.

One
afternoon
during
a
cold
,
powdery
snowstorm
,
Fogg
took
off
for
Concord
from
the
St.
John
field
.

Are
you
retiring
now
?
?

How
did
I
get
to
be
sixty-five
so
fast
?
?

Out
of
the
blue
comes
talk
of
pension
plans
.

So
,
now
what
?
?

never
seemed
as
if
it
could
happen
to
you
;
;

Now
!
!

Where
do
I
go
from
here
?
?

A
great
many
retired
people
are
the
so-called
white
collar
workers
.

Yes
sir
!
!

That's
called
progress
!
!

Let's
face
it
!
!

Time
marches
on
!
!

Well
,
to
get
back
to
the
problem
of
retirement
.

Now
!
!

There
are
many
,
many
things
to
do
.

Some
women
can
sit
and
sew
,
crochet
,
tat
or
knit
by
the
hour
,
and
look
calm
and
relaxed
and
turn
out
beautiful
work
.

Do
you
yearn
to
make
cakes
and
pies
,
or
special
cookies
and
candies
?
?

Perhaps
you
would
like
to
become
a
writer
.

This
gives
you
a
wide
and
varied
choice
.

Ever
since
I
was
a
child
,
I
have
always
had
a
yen
to
try
my
hand
at
writing
.

This
is
just
being
a
normal
writer
.

But
,
it
could
happen
,
and
it
may
happen
to
you
.

How
about
a
rock
collection
,
or
a
collection
of
leaves
from
different
trees
or
shrubs
and
in
different
colors
?
?

They
are
many
and
varied
.

Also
,
there's
scrap
books
,
collecting
newspaper
pictures
and
clippings
,
or
any
items
of
interest
to
you
.

As
for
me
,
I
am
holding
in
reserve
two
huge
puzzles
(
I
love
puzzles
)
to
put
together
when
time
hangs
heavy
on
my
hands
.

Travel
,
if
you
can
.

An
important
criterion
of
maturity
is
creativity
.

What
does
it
mean
to
be
creative
,
a
term
we
hear
with
increasing
frequency
these
days
?
?

When
we
turn
to
Noah
Webster
we
find
him
helpful
as
usual
.

In
fact
all
of
our
civilized
world
is
the
resultant
of
man's
projection
of
his
imagination
over
the
past
60
centuries
or
more
.

Is
not
the
present
world
crisis
a
race
between
things
we
have
created
which
can
now
destroy
us
and
between
populations
of
sufficient
wisdom
and
character
to
forestall
the
tragedy
.

Is
it
not
the
obligation
of
us
older
citizens
to
lend
our
weight
to
being
creative
on
the
character
side
and
to
hasten
our
own
maturing
process
?
?

Sir
Julian
Huxley
in
his
book
Uniqueness
Of
Man
makes
the
novel
point
that
just
as
man
is
unique
in
being
the
only
animal
which
requires
a
long
period
of
infancy
and
childhood
under
family
protection
,
so
is
he
the
only
animal
who
has
a
long
period
after
the
decline
of
his
procreativity
.

Privacy
must
be
highly
assured
both
in
time
and
place
.

If
the
wedding
party
lasted
late
,
and
the
travel
schedule
means
there
are
only
a
few
hours
before
resuming
the
trip
or
making
an
early
start
,
the
husband
may
forestall
tensions
and
uncertainties
by
confiding
to
his
bride
that
lying
in
each
other's
arms
will
be
bliss
enough
for
these
few
hours
.

(
Hymen
,
in
fact
,
is
the
Greek
word
for
membrane
.

)

As
might
be
expected
,
girls
in
this
situation
bleed
very
little
and
perhaps
not
at
all
in
the
process
of
losing
their
virginity
.

so
that
the
absence
of
the
hymen
is
by
no
means
positive
proof
that
a
girl
has
had
sex
relations
.

That
is
,
when
first
penetration
takes
place
,
the
pressure
and
pain
signals
may
involuntarily
cause
all
the
vaginal
muscles
to
contract
in
an
effort
to
bar
the
intrusion
and
prevent
further
pain
.

By
using
instruments
of
gradually
increasing
size
,
the
vagina
is
gently
,
and
with
minimum
pain
at
each
stage
,
taught
to
yield
to
an
object
of
the
appropriate
shape
.

In
this
process
the
vaginal
muscles
come
under
better
conscious
control
by
the
girl
.

When
no
medical
problems
exist
,
the
newly
married
couple
generally
prefer
to
cope
with
the
adjustments
of
their
new
relationship
by
themselves
.

and
in
fact
without
any
difficulty
if
the
pressure
is
kept
downward
at
all
times
.

They
may
then
adjust
their
positions
and
movements
to
avoid
too
much
pressure
on
the
urethra
and
the
anterior
wall
of
the
vagina
;
;

The
best
course
is
to
recover
his
physical
excitement
by
a
change
of
pace
that
makes
him
ardent
again
.

He
can
take
security
from
the
fact
that
the
progress
he
has
made
by
his
gentle
approach
will
not
be
lost
.

The
accumulated
information
on
this
point
shows
that
first
intercourse
,
even
when
it
is
achieved
with
minimum
pain
or
difficulty
,
is
seldom
an
overwhelming
sexual
experience
to
a
woman
.

Such
understanding
helps
to
explain
why
one
matron
celebrating
thirty-five
years
of
married
life
could
declare
with
some
pride
that
her
husband
had
``
never
seen
her
entirely
naked
''
,
while
another
woman
,
boasting
an
equal
number
of
years
of
married
life
,
is
proud
of
having
``
shared
the
nudist
way
of
life
--
the
really
free
,
natural
nude
life
--
for
most
of
that
period
''
.

The
indignant
crusader
sees
the
nude
or
semi-nude
human
form
as
``
lewd
and
pornographic
,
a
threat
and
danger
''
to
all
the
young
,
or
good
,
or
religious
,
or
moral
persons
.

I
still
recall
the
mild
shock
I
experienced
in
reading
material
of
an
enthusiastic
advocate
of
the
``
clean
,
healthful
,
free
way
of
natural
life
in
nudism
''
,
who
seemed
to
brave
much
misunderstanding
and
persecution
in
fine
spirit
.

This
is
the
ideal
.

Beyond
a
certain
point
,
of
course
,
no
woman
can
be
dominant
--
nature
has
seen
to
that
.

On
the
other
hand
,
wifely
supremacy
demeans
the
husband
,
saps
his
self-respect
,
and
robs
him
of
his
masculinity
.

The
wife
is
likely
to
be
young
,
sophisticated
,
smart
as
a
whip
--
often
a
girl
who
has
sacrificed
a
promising
career
for
marriage
.

The
husband
is
usually
a
well-educated
professional
,
preoccupied
with
his
job
--
often
an
organization
man
whose
motto
for
getting
ahead
is
:
``
Don't
rock
the
boat
''
.

Some
psychologists
,
in
fact
,
suggest
that
career-bound
husbands
often
are
more
to
blame
for
topsy-turvy
marriages
than
their
wives
.

They
like
to
be
dominated
.

She
liked
this
taste
of
authority
and
independence
,
and
,
with
darkness
,
was
not
likely
to
give
it
up
.

``
Very
few
wives
''
,
says
Dr.
Calderone
,
``
who
balance
the
checkbook
,
fix
the
car
,
choose
where
the
family
will
live
and
deal
with
the
tradesmen
,
are
suddenly
going
to
become
submissive
where
sex
is
concerned
.

In
fact
,
the
noted
psychologist
and
sex
researcher
,
Dr.
Albert
Ellis
,
has
declared
flatly
that
women
are
``
sexually
superior
''
to
men
.

Not
surprisingly
,
Dr.
Ellis
says
,
some
recently
enlightened
wives
are
out
to
claim
these
capabilities
.

``
When
the
husband
becomes
passive
in
the
face
of
his
wife's
aggressiveness
''
,
Dr.
Linden
says
,
``
the
wife
,
in
turn
,
finds
him
inadequate
.

Or
a
wife
may
make
sudden
demands
that
she
be
courted
,
flattered
or
coaxed
,
simply
because
she
needs
her
ego
lifted
.

In
any
case
,
Dr.
Calderone
remarks
,
such
problems
are
a
couple's
own
affair
,
and
can't
always
be
measured
by
a
general
yardstick
.

``
As
long
as
the
couple
is
in
agreement
in
their
approach
to
sex
,
it
makes
little
difference
if
one
or
the
other
dominates
''
,
Dr.
Calderone
declares
.

Other
experts
say
,
however
,
that
if
sexual
domination
by
one
or
the
other
partner
exists
for
longer
than
a
brief
period
,
it
is
likely
to
shake
the
marriage
.

He
must
begin
,
paradoxically
,
by
becoming
more
selfish
.

She
gave
herself
a
title
,
Lady
Diana
Harrington
.

Early
in
her
life
she
had
discovered
that
where
there
were
men
,
there
was
money
,
and
with
the
two
came
luxury
and
liquor
.

)

``
We
have
checked
her
in
different
parts
of
Europe
and
Egypt
and
finally
back
into
this
country
.

``
That's
a
lie
.

As
she
told
it
,
``
He's
a
rich
boy
friend
,
an
old
guy
about
60
''
.

She
had
talked
her
``
boy
friend
''
into
sending
her
to
New
York
to
take
a
screen
test
.

More
often
than
not
he
would
bow
to
the
inevitable
.

``
Then
she
went
to
Deauville
where
she
met
a
member
of
a
powerful
Greek
syndicate
of
gamblers
''
.

No
one
ever
learned
what
happened
to
the
Greek
.

The
luxury
of
Paris'
most
fashionable
hotel
,
the
George
5
,
,
bored
the
beautifully-built
blonde
,
so
she
high-tailed
it
to
Rome
.

Discreet
Italian
police
described
it
in
a
manner
typically
continental
.

By
this
time
Diane
was
a
beguiling
lass
of
19
and
still
seeking
her
place
in
the
world
.

No
believer
in
the
traditional
devotion
of
royal
servitors
,
the
plump
Pulley
broke
the
language
barrier
and
lured
her
to
Cairo
where
she
waited
for
nine
months
,
vainly
hoping
to
see
Farouk
.

She
picked
her
own
Middle-Eastern
friends
from
the
flock
of
ardent
Egyptians
that
buzzed
around
her
.

Tewfik
Badrawi
,
Mohammed
Gaafer
and
numerous
other
wealthy
members
of
Cairo
society
enjoyed
her
company
.

``
So
extensive
became
her
circle
of
admirers
''
,
Egyptian
police
said
,
``
that
her
escapades
caused
distrust
''
.

Last
May
,
they
said
,
she
admitted
being
a
prostitute
.

The
next
time
the
police
saw
her
she
was
dead
.

It
was
September
20
,
1960
,
in
a
lavishly
decorated
apartment
littered
with
liquor
bottles
.

Pictures
of
her
in
more
glamorous
days
were
on
the
walls
.

``
I
think
that
maybe
she
wanted
it
this
way
''
,
a
vice
squad
cop
said
.

At
least
she
never
knew
what
the
bottom
was
like
''
.

There
is
only
one
trouble
with
this
big
,
beautiful
dream
.

They
depend
on
my
supposedly
expert
knowledge
of
a
trade
of
which
they
themselves
know
little
.

Franklin
D.
Lee
proved
a
man
of
prompt
action
when
Mrs.
Claire
Shaefer
,
accompanied
by
a
friend
,
visited
him
in
Bakersfield
,
California
,
several
months
ago
as
a
prospective
patient
.

As
he
applied
the
applicator
extending
from
the
machine
--
which
consisted
of
seven
differently
colored
neon
tubes
superimposed
on
a
rectangular
base
--
to
the
supposedly
diseased
portions
of
Mrs.
Shaefer's
body
,
Lee
kept
up
a
steady
stream
of
pseudo-scientific
mumbo-jumbo
.

For
that
reason
,
he
informed
her
,
the
Lord
made
the
sky
blue
.

Continuing
glibly
in
this
vein
,
he
paused
to
comfort
her
:

He
then
sold
her
some
capsules
that
he
asserted
would
take
care
of
the
tumors
and
cysts
until
she
could
collect
the
money
for
buying
his
machine
.

When
she
submitted
to
his
treatment
with
the
capsules
,
Mrs.
Shaefer
felt
intense
pain
.

The
charge
:
violation
of
the
California
Medical
Practices
Act
by
practicing
medicine
without
a
license
and
selling
misbranded
drugs
.

An
isolated
case
of
quackery
?
?

The
machine
quack
makes
his
Rube
Goldberg
devices
out
of
odds
and
ends
of
metals
,
wires
,
and
radio
parts
.

With
these
gadgets
--
impressive
to
the
gullible
because
of
their
flashing
light
bulbs
,
ticks
,
and
buzzes
--
he
then
carries
out
a
vicious
medical
con
game
,
capitalizing
on
people's
respect
for
the
electrical
and
atomic
wonders
of
our
scientific
age
.

According
to
the
Food
And
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
,
``
Doctor
''
Ghadiali
,
Dr.
Albert
Abrams
and
his
clique
,
and
Dr.
Wilhelm
Reich
--
to
name
three
notorious
device
quacks
--
succeeded
,
respectively
,
in
distributing
10,000
,
5000
,
and
2000
fake
health
machines
.

Authorities
believe
that
many
of
the
Doctor
Frauds
using
these
false
health
gadgets
are
still
in
business
.

Look
at
the
sums
paid
by
two
device
quack
victims
in
Cleveland
.

Sarah
Gross
,
a
dress
shop
proprietor
,
paid
$1020
to
a
masseur
,
and
Mr.
A.
,
a
laborer
,
paid
$4200
to
a
chiropractor
for
treatment
with
two
fake
health
machines
--
the
``
radioclast
''
and
the
``
diagnometer
''
.

Multiply
these
figures
by
the
millions
of
people
known
to
be
conned
by
medical
pirates
annually
.

Similarly
,
the
American
Cancer
Society
(
ACS
)
,
the
Arthritis
and
Rheumatism
Foundation
,
and
the
BBB
have
each
stated
lately
that
medical
quackery
is
at
a
new
high
.

For
example
,
the
BBB
has
reported
it
was
receiving
four
times
as
many
inquiries
about
quack
devices
and
10
times
as
many
complaints
compared
with
two
years
ago
.

As
a
result
,
she
consulted
medical
authorities
and
learned
that
the
devices
her
quack
``
doctor
''
was
using
were
phony
.

Mr.
A.
,
her
fellow
townsman
,
also
experienced
a
nervous
breakdown
just
as
soon
as
he
discovered
that
he
had
been
bilked
of
his
life
savings
by
the
limited
practitioner
who
had
been
treating
his
wife
--
a
woman
suffering
from
an
incurable
disease
,
multiple
sclerosis
--
and
himself
.

Mr.
A
has
recovered
,
but
he
is
,
justifiably
,
a
bitter
man
.

``
Neither
me
nor
my
wife
were
helped
by
that
chiropractor's
treatments
''
.

And
there
was
the
case
of
Tom
Hepker
,
a
machinist
,
who
was
referred
by
a
friend
to
a
health
machine
quack
who
treated
him
with
a
so-called
diagnostic
machine
for
what
Doctor
Fraud
said
was
a
system
full
of
arsenic
and
strychnine
.

But
the
machine
quack
can
cause
far
more
than
just
suffering
.

In
Chicago
,
some
time
ago
,
Mr.
H.
,
age
27
,
a
diabetic
since
he
was
six
,
stopped
using
insulin
because
he
had
bought
a
``
magic
spike
''
--
a
glass
tube
about
the
size
of
a
pencil
filled
with
barium
chloride
worth
a
small
fraction
of
a
cent
--
sold
by
the
Vrilium
Company
of
Chicago
for
$306
as
a
cure-all
.

Mr.
H.
is
dead
today
because
he
followed
this
advice
.

His
prescription
:
hot
and
cold
compresses
to
increase
her
absorption
of
water
.

Moreover
,
her
husband
and
child
contracted
T.B.
from
her
.

Who
are
the
victims
of
the
device
quacks
?
?

Ten-year-old
Richard
Stewart
had
been
irritable
and
quarrelsome
for
almost
a
year
.

His
grades
had
gone
steadily
downhill
,
and
he
had
stopped
bringing
friends
and
classmates
home
from
school
.

Mr.
and
Mrs.
Stewart
were
puzzled
and
concerned
.

The
youngsters
in
the
boys'
class
had
nicknamed
Dick
``
Bugs
Bunny
''
because
his
teeth
protruded
.

Richard
Stewart
is
no
special
case
.

Second
teeth
that
have
come
in
before
the
first
ones
have
fallen
out
,
making
a
double
row
.

Contrary
to
the
thinking
of
30
to
40
years
ago
,
when
all
malocclusion
was
blamed
on
some
unfortunate
habit
,
recent
studies
show
that
most
tooth
irregularity
has
at
least
its
beginning
in
hereditary
predisposition
.

It's
perfectly
normal
for
babies
to
suck
their
thumbs
,
and
no
mother
need
worry
if
a
child
continues
this
habit
until
he
is
two
or
three
years
old
.

but
after
that
,
if
thumb-sucking
pressure
is
frequent
,
it
will
have
an
effect
.

Correction
can
save
teeth

Badly
placed
teeth
can
also
cause
such
a
speech
handicap
as
lisping
.

This
must
be
done
at
the
rate
at
which
new
bony
tissue
grows
,
and
no
faster
.

During
the
first
few
days
of
wearing
the
appliance
and
immediately
following
each
adjustment
,
Susan
may
have
a
slight
discomfort
or
soreness
,
but
after
a
short
time
this
will
disappear
.

During
these
visits
the
dentist
will
adjust
the
braces
to
increase
the
pressure
on
her
teeth
.

Aligning
all
the
teeth
may
take
a
year
or
more
.

An
added
complication
such
as
a
malformed
jaw
may
take
two
or
three
years
to
correct
.

What
is
the
cost
?
?

Work
that
might
cost
$500
to
$750
in
the
South
could
cost
$750
to
$1,200
in
New
York
City
or
Chicago
.

An
average
national
figure
for
two
to
three
years
of
treatment
would
be
$650
to
$1,000
.

To
become
an
orthodontist
,
a
man
must
first
be
licensed
by
his
state
as
a
dentist
,
then
he
must
spend
at
least
two
years
in
additional
training
to
acquire
a
license
as
a
specialist
.

People
today
are
aware
of
the
value
of
orthodontics
,
and
as
a
result
there
are
more
practitioners
in
the
field
.

Most
orthodontists
require
an
initial
payment
to
cover
the
cost
of
diagnostic
materials
and
construction
of
the
appliances
,
but
usually
the
remainder
of
the
cost
may
be
spread
over
a
period
of
months
or
years
.

Some
municipal
agencies
will
pay
for
orthodontic
treatment
for
children
of
needy
parents
.

growth
studies
have
been
carried
on
consistently
by
orthodontists
.

Dr.
Brodie
has
30-year
records
of
head
growth
,
started
20
minutes
after
children's
births
.

For
example
,
a
boy
may
inherit
a
small
jaw
from
one
ancestor
and
large
teeth
from
another
.

In
other
cases
,
in
view
of
present-day
knowledge
of
head
growth
,
orthodontists
will
recommend
waiting
four
or
five
years
before
treatment
.

That
is
why
Dr.
Brodie
asks
parents
not
to
insist
,
against
their
dentist's
advice
,
that
their
child
have
orthodontic
work
done
too
early
.

Superior
new
material
for
orthodontic
work
is
another
result
of
research
.

Plastics
are
easier
to
handle
than
the
vulcanized
rubber
formerly
used
,
and
they
save
time
and
money
.

as
a
rule
,
the
earlier
general
dental
treatment
is
started
,
the
less
expensive
and
more
satisfactory
it
is
likely
to
be
.

To
help
prevent
orthodontic
problems
from
arising
,
your
dentist
can
do
these
things
:

Another
medium
,
another
sitter
,
would
produce
a
somewhat
different
content
,
but
in
general
it
would
probably
sound
much
like
the
foregoing
reading
.

Some
mediums
speak
in
practical
,
down-to-earth
terms
,
while
others
may
stress
the
spiritual
.

Perhaps
they
are
mourning
a
recent
death
and
want
comfort
,
to
feel
in
touch
with
the
deceased
,
or
seek
indications
for
future
plans
.

For
this
was
to
be
a
``
proxy
sitting
''
.

As
was
noted
earlier
,
it
is
important
that
in
valid
,
objective
study
of
this
sort
of
communication
,
the
interested
sitter
should
be
separated
from
the
sensitive
.

He
remarked
:
``
It
has
been
clearly
established
that
in
a
number
of
instances
the
message
did
not
come
from
a
spirit
but
was
received
telepathically
by
the
medium
from
the
sitter
''
.

It
is
now
harder
to
assume
telepathy
as
a
basis
for
the
statements
--
though
research
still
does
not
know
how
far
afield
ESP
can
range
.

It
is
,
of
course
,
easy
to
see
how
``
J
''
will
mean
Uncle
Jack
to
one
person
and
little
Jane
to
another
.

``
A
journey
''
,
``
a
little
white
house
''
,
``
a
change
of
outlook
''
,
can
apply
to
many
people
.

If
he
is
not
told
which
of
four
or
five
readings
was
meant
for
him
,
he
can
more
readily
assess
each
item
in
a
larger
frame
:
``
Does
that
statement
really
sound
as
if
it
were
for
me
,
significant
in
my
particular
life
?
?

``
He
had
four
children
,
two
sets
of
twins
.

Methods
have
been
developed
of
assigning
``
weights
''
to
statements
;
;

that
fewer
women
are
named
Miranda
than
Elizabeth
;
;

So
each
reading
can
be
given
a
weight
and
each
reading
a
score
by
adding
up
these
weights
.

He
is
required
to
mark
every
item
and
to
indicate
which
reading
he
feels
is
actually
his
.

Even
in
normal
experience
one
gets
impressions
without
knowing
exactly
how
--
of
atmosphere
,
of
one
another's
personalities
,
moods
,
intentions
.

Of
course
,
there
is
an
element
of
training
here
:
these
gifted
people
,
by
concentration
,
study
,
guidance
,
have
learned
to
develop
their
power
.

Nor
does
a
medium
automatically
know
how
to
interpret
her
imagery
.

taken
with
other
details
it
could
have
referred
to
a
state
of
mental
or
spiritual
confinement
.

Even
if
there
are
no
livestock
,
the
farmer
cannot
leave
the
farm
for
long
periods
,
particularly
during
the
growing
season
.

such
a
move
may
mean
a
loss
of
capital
.

Production
may
fall
far
below
expectations
.

Returns
for
money
and
labor
invested
may
be
small
even
in
a
good
year
.

If
it
is
owned
,
taxes
must
be
paid
,
and
if
the
place
is
not
free
of
mortgage
,
there
will
be
interest
and
payments
on
the
principal
to
take
care
of
.

Advantages

It
gives
them
room
to
play
and
plenty
of
fresh
air
.

Usually
,
the
cost
of
food
and
shelter
will
be
somewhat
less
on
the
farm
and
the
cost
of
transportation
and
utilities
somewhat
more
.

Where
schools
,
fire
and
police
protection
,
and
similar
municipal
services
are
of
equal
quality
in
city
and
country
,
real
estate
taxes
are
usually
about
the
same
.

General
requirements
for
land
,
labor
,
and
equipment
are
discussed
below
.

Three
quarters
to
1
acre
of
good
land
is
enough
for
raising
fruits
and
vegetables
for
home
use
,
and
for
a
small
flock
of
chickens
,
a
cow
,
and
two
pigs
.

But
consider
also
how
much
you
and
your
family
can
keep
up
along
with
your
other
work
.

This
is
a
highly
speculative
venture
.

When
surplus
land
is
not
expensive
to
buy
or
to
keep
up
,
it
is
usually
better
to
buy
it
than
to
buy
so
small
an
acreage
that
the
development
of
adjoining
properties
might
impair
the
residential
value
of
the
farm
.

Labor

You
may
want
to
include
your
own
regular
vacation
period
if
you
have
one
.

You
will
probably
want
to
hire
someone
to
do
the
plowing
,
however
.

If
you
have
a
planting
of
half
an
acre
or
more
you
may
want
to
buy
a
small
garden
tractor
(
available
for
$300
to
$500
with
attachments
,
1960
prices
)
.

Look
for
a
farm
in
a
neighborhood
of
well-kept
homes
.

Few
rural
areas
are
protected
by
zoning
.

You
may
have
to
provide
them
yourself
or
get
along
without
them
.

You
cannot
get
along
without
an
adequate
supply
of
pure
water
.

Pond
water
can
be
filtered
for
human
use
,
but
most
part-time
farmers
would
not
want
to
go
to
so
much
trouble
.

If
you
can't
tell
,
get
help
from
your
county
agricultural
agent
or
other
local
specialist
.

Decide
first
what
the
place
is
worth
to
you
and
your
family
as
a
home
in
comparison
with
what
it
would
cost
to
live
in
town
.

To
do
this
,
set
up
a
plan
on
paper
for
operating
the
farm
.

It
may
be
hard
to
decide
what
this
labor
is
worth
,
but
charge
something
for
it
.

The
gruesome
humor
of
the
Nazis
was
not
forgotten
--
the
gas
chamber
with
a
sign
on
it
with
the
name
of
a
Jewish
foundation
and
bearing
a
copper
Star
of
David
--
nor
the
gratuitous
sadism
of
SS
officers
.

Those
who
feared
``
emotionalism
''
at
the
Trial
showed
less
understanding
than
Dr.
Servatius
of
the
route
by
which
man
achieves
the
distance
necessary
for
fairness
toward
enemies
.

In
each
of
the
last
,
the
trial
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
course
:
in
Moscow
the
liquidation
of
the
Old
Bolsheviks
and
the
tightening
of
Stalin's
dictatorship
;
;

As
such
,
it
was
beyond
politics
and
had
no
need
of
justification
by
a
``
message
''
.

But
in
either
event
he
was
the
wrong
man
for
the
kind
of
case
outlined
by
Ben
Gurion
and
set
forth
in
the
indictment
.

Shout
at
Eichmann
though
he
might
,
the
Prosecutor
could
not
establish
that
the
defendant
was
falsifying
the
way
he
felt
about
Jews
or
that
what
he
did
feel
fell
into
the
generally
recognized
category
of
anti-Semitism
.

Perhaps
under
the
guidance
of
this
Nazi
principle
one
could
,
as
Eichmann
declared
,
feel
personally
friendly
toward
the
Jews
and
still
be
their
murderer
.

Heydrich
,
in
opening
the
Conference
,
followed
the
reasoning
and
even
the
phraseology
of
the
order
issued
earlier
by
Goering
which
authorized
the
Final
Solution
as
``
a
complement
to
''
previous
``
solutions
''
for
eliminating
the
Jews
from
German
living
space
through
violence
,
economic
strangulation
,
forced
emigration
,
and
evacuation
.

But
if
there
was
evidence
at
the
Trial
that
aimed
over
Eichmann's
head
at
his
collaborators
in
the
societies
where
he
functioned
,
the
press
seems
to
have
missed
it
.

The
career
of
Eichmann
made
the
Trial
a
potential
showcase
for
anti-Semitic
demoralization
:
fearful
of
being
mistaken
for
a
Jew
,
he
seeks
protection
in
his
Nazi
uniform
;
;

The
Trial
should
have
asked
the
nations
.

Finally
,
if
the
mission
of
the
Trial
was
to
convict
anti-Semitism
,
how
could
it
have
failed
to
post
before
the
world
the
contrasting
fates
of
the
countries
in
which
the
Final
Solution
was
aided
by
native
Jew-haters
--
i.e.
,
Germany
,
Poland
,
Hungary
,
Czechoslovakia
--
and
those
in
which
it
met
the
obstacle
of
human
solidarity
--
Denmark
,
Holland
,
Italy
,
Bulgaria
,
France
?
?

In
Poughkeepsie
,
N.Y.
,
,
in
1952
,
a
Roman
Catholic
hospital
presented
seven
Protestant
physicians
with
an
ultimatum
to
quit
the
Planned
Parenthood
Federation
or
to
resign
from
the
hospital
staff
.

After
a
flood
of
protests
,
they
were
reinstated
at
the
beginning
of
1953
.

Where
it
is
not
actually
erupting
,
it
rumbles
and
smolders
in
sullen
resentment
like
a
volcano
,
ready
to
explode
at
any
moment
.

The
time
has
come
for
citizens
of
all
faiths
to
unite
in
an
effort
to
remove
this
divisive
and
nettlesome
issue
from
the
political
and
social
life
of
our
nation
.

The
first
step
toward
the
goal
is
the
establishment
of
a
new
atmosphere
of
mutual
good
will
and
friendly
communication
on
other
than
the
polemical
level
.

All
too
often
our
language
is
unduly
harsh
.

Thus
,
man
can
readily
deduce
that
the
primary
objective
end
of
the
conjugal
act
is
procreation
,
the
propagation
of
the
race
.

Let
it
be
granted
then
that
the
theological
differences
in
this
area
between
Protestants
and
Roman
Catholics
appear
to
be
irreconcilable
.

With
the
return
of
our
soldiers
,
it
soon
became
apparent
that
the
belief
was
not
shared
by
the
great
majority
of
citizens
.

The
attempt
to
enforce
that
belief
ushered
in
a
reign
of
bootleggers
,
racketeers
,
hijackers
and
gangsters
that
led
to
a
breakdown
of
law
unparalleled
in
our
history
.

One
is
the
primary
purpose
for
which
marriage
exists
,
namely
,
the
continuance
of
the
race
through
the
gift
and
heritage
of
children
;
;

Many
other
Protestant
denominations
preceded
the
Anglicans
in
such
action
.

Since
then
,
many
Protestant
denominations
have
made
separate
pronouncements
,
in
which
they
not
only
approved
birth
control
,
but
declared
it
at
times
to
be
a
religious
duty
.

The
general
Protestant
conviction
is
that
motives
,
rather
than
methods
,
form
the
primary
moral
issue
,
provided
the
methods
are
limited
to
the
prevention
of
conception
''
.

This
viewpoint
has
now
been
translated
into
action
by
the
majority
of
people
in
this
country
.

Among
the
chief
victims
of
such
an
ill-conceived
imposition
would
be
religion
itself
.

But
since
1927
,
researchers
digging
into
ancient
court
records
and
legal
files
have
been
able
to
find
illuminating
pieces
of
information
.

Not
enough
to
do
away
with
all
doubts
,
but
sufficient
to
give
a
fairly
accurate
picture
of
the
events
of
the
voyage
.

Historians
have
had
two
reasons
for
persisting
so
long
in
their
investigations
.

Each
time
his
objective
had
been
the
same
--
a
direct
water
passage
from
Western
Europe
to
the
Far
East
.

In
1609
,
the
Dutch
East
India
Company
hired
Hudson
,
gave
him
two
learned
geographers
,
fitted
him
out
with
a
ship
called
the
Half
Moon
,
and
supplied
him
with
Dutch
sailors
.

His
chief
discovery
was
important
--
the
Great
North
(
later
,
the
Hudson
)
River
--
but
it
produced
no
northwest
passage
.

The
government
forbade
Hudson
to
return
to
Amsterdam
with
his
ship
.

The
purpose
of
this
fourth
voyage
was
clear
.

In
fact
,
Hudson's
sail
up
the
Great
North
River
had
disposed
of
one
of
the
last
hopes
.

But
there
remained
one
mysterious
,
unexplored
gap
,
far
to
the
north
.

Worse
,
his
present
crew
included
five
men
who
had
sailed
with
him
before
.

And
he
refused
to
be
anything
else
.

)
In
1610
,
Hudson
was
probably
in
his
early
forties
,
a
good
navigator
,
a
stubborn
voyager
,
but
otherwise
fatally
unsuited
to
his
chosen
profession
.

Hudson's
first
error
of
the
fourth
voyage
occurred
only
a
few
miles
down
the
Thames
.

Greene
was
in
actuality
a
young
ruffian
from
Kent
,
who
had
broken
with
his
parents
in
order
to
keep
the
company
he
preferred
--
pimps
,
panders
and
whores
.

Early
in
June
,
the
Discovery
passed
``
Desolation
''
(
southern
Greenland
)
and
in
mid-June
entered
the
``
Furious
Overfall
''
.

As
the
bergs
grew
larger
,
Hudson
was
forced
to
turn
south
into
what
is
now
Ungava
Bay
,
an
inlet
of
the
Great
Strait
.

The
great
,
crushing
ice
masses
coming
into
view
made
him
sound
like
the
voice
of
pure
reason
.

The
statement
was
effective
.

To
starboard
was
a
cape
a
thousand
feet
high
,
patched
with
ice
and
snow
,
populated
by
thousands
of
screaming
sea
birds
.

The
ship
halted
.

This
was
the
bitter
end
,
and
Hudson
seemed
to
know
he
was
destined
to
failure
.

Juet
demanded
that
Hudson
prove
his
charges
in
an
open
trial
.

The
trial
was
held
September
10
.

The
important
result
,
however
,
was
that
Juet
and
Francis
Clemens
,
the
deposed
boatswain
,
became
Hudson's
sworn
enemies
.

As
Hudson
resumed
his
desperate
criss-crossing
of
the
little
bay
,
every
incident
lessened
the
crew's
respect
for
him
.

Just
as
it
was
being
hauled
inboard
,
a
sea
hit
the
ship
.

Since
the
land
he
desired
lay
within
the
great
northern
empire
of
the
Hudson's
Bay
Company
,
he
purchased
great
blocks
of
the
Comany's
stock
with
the
view
to
controlling
its
policies
.

On
Big
Stone
Lake
near
the
headwaters
of
the
Red
River
,
Robert
Dickson
,
Superintendent
of
the
Western
Indian
Department
of
Canada
,
had
a
trading
post
and
planned
in
1818
to
build
a
fort
to
be
defended
by
twenty
men
and
two
small
artillery
pieces
.

In
1802
Henry
referred
to
``
our
new
carts
''
as
being
about
four
feet
off
the
ground
and
carrying
five
times
as
much
as
a
horse
could
pack
.

They
were
held
together
by
pegs
and
withes
and
in
later
times
drawn
by
a
single
ox
in
thills
.

It
was
Dickson
who
suggested
to
Lord
Selkirk
that
he
return
to
the
Atlantic
coast
by
way
of
the
United
States
.

It
was
a
three-month
journey
in
the
dead
of
winter
followed
by
three
months
of
labor
on
Mackinac
boats
.

Nevertheless
so
short
was
the
supply
of
seed
that
the
settlers
were
forced
to
retreat
to
Fort
Daer
for
food
.

Thereafter
seed
and
food
became
more
plentiful
and
the
colony
remained
in
the
north
the
year
round
.

Bailly
,
after
leaving
Fort
Snelling
in
August
1821
,
was
forced
to
leave
some
of
the
cattle
at
the
Hudson's
Bay
Company's
post
on
Lake
Traverse
``
in
the
Sieux
Country
''
and
reached
Fort
Garry
,
as
the
Selkirk
Hudson's
Bay
Company
center
was
now
called
,
late
in
the
fall
.

He
set
out
on
his
700-mile
return
journey
with
five
families
of
discontented
and
disappointed
Swiss
who
turned
their
eyes
toward
the
United
States
.

As
these
Swiss
were
moving
from
the
Selkirk
settlement
to
become
the
first
civilian
residents
of
Minnesota
,
Dousman
of
Michilimackinac
,
Michigan
,
and
Prairie
Du
Chien
was
traveling
to
Red
River
to
open
a
trade
in
merchandise
.

For
its
part
the
Hudson's
Bay
Company
was
troubled
by
the
approach
of
American
settlement
.

As
the
time
drew
near
for
the
drawing
of
the
British-American
frontier
by
terms
of
the
agreement
of
1818
,
the
company
suspected
that
the
Pembina
colony
--
its
own
post
and
Fort
Daer
--
was
on
American
territory
.

Accordingly
Selkirk's
agents
ordered
the
settlers
to
move
north
,
and
by
October
,
John
Halkett
had
torn
down
both
posts
,
floating
the
timber
to
``
the
Forks
''
in
rafts
.

They
would
attempt
to
bring
supplies
from
St.
Louis
or
Prairie
Du
Chien
at
``
great
expense
as
well
as
danger
''
.

At
Fort
Garry
some
of
the
Swiss
also
decided
to
cast
their
lot
with
the
United
States
,
and
in
1823
several
families
paid
guides
to
take
them
to
Fort
Snelling
.

A
third
wrote
that
it
was
``
raining
like
poring
peas
on
a
rawhide
''
.

A
third
remarked
of
slowness
of
Southerners
:
``
they
moved
about
from
corner
to
corner
,
as
uneasy
as
a
litter
of
hungry
leaches
on
the
neck
of
a
wooden
god
''
.

She
is
a
regular
stub
and
twister
,
double
geered
.

When
you
see
them
again
give
them
my
love
--
not
best
respects
now
,
but
love
by
God
''
.

I
don't
feel
much
like
a
maryed
man
but
I
never
forgit
it
sofar
as
to
court
enny
other
lady
but
if
I
should
you
must
forgive
me
as
I
am
so
forgitful
''
.

A
Yank
,
disturbed
by
his
increasing
corpulence
,
wrote
:
``
I
am
growing
so
fat
I
am
a
burden
2
myself
''
.

But
he
was
very
much
like
his
associates
in
his
hatred
of
camp
routine
.

The
soldiers
who
comprised
the
rank
and
file
of
the
Civil
War
armies
were
an
earthy
people
.

Men
of
more
delicate
sensibilities
referred
to
this
condition
as
``
looseness
of
the
bowels
''
;
;

I
eat
too
much
eggs
and
poark
.

A
Michigan
soldier
wrote
his
brother
:
``
I
am
well
at
present
with
the
exception
I
have
got
the
Dyerear
and
I
hope
thease
few
lines
find
you
the
same
''
.

The
letters
which
poured
forth
from
camps
were
usually
written
under
adverse
circumstances
.

Save
for
brief
periods
in
garrison
or
winter
quarters
,
soldiers
rarely
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
a
writing
desk
or
table
.

Most
of
the
letters
were
written
in
the
hubbub
of
camp
,
on
stumps
,
pieces
of
bark
,
drum
heads
,
or
the
knee
.

In
the
South
,
after
the
first
year
of
the
war
,
paper
and
ink
were
very
poor
.

Rebs
who
owned
slaves
occasionally
would
include
in
their
letters
admonitions
or
greetings
to
members
of
the
Negro
community
.

Owing
to
the
restrained
usages
characteristic
of
19th-century
America
,
these
letters
usually
were
stereotyped
and
revealed
little
depth
of
feeling
.

An
Ohio
soldier
who
,
from
a
comrade
just
returned
from
leave
,
received
an
unfavorable
comment
on
the
conduct
of
his
sister
,
took
pen
in
hand
and
delivered
himself
thus
:
``
dear
Sis
.

Alf
sed
he
heard
that
you
and
Hardy
was
a
runing
together
all
the
time
and
he
though
he
wod
gust
quit
having
any
thing
mor
to
doo
with
you
for
he
thought
it
was
no
more
yuse
.

I
will
shute
him
as
shore
as
I
sea
him
''
.

Initiation
into
combat
sometimes
elicited
from
soldier
correspondents
choice
comments
about
their
experiences
and
reactions
.

Thay
may
say
what
they
please
but
godamit
Pa
it
is
fun
''
.

He
is
not
worth
shucks
.

Shortly
after
the
beginning
of
Sherman's
Georgia
campaign
,
an
ailing
Yank
wrote
his
homefolk
:
``
the
surgeon
insisted
on
sending
me
to
the
hospital
for
treatment
.

I
insisted
on
takeing
the
field
and
prevailed
--
thinking
that
I
had
better
die
by
rebel
bullets
than
(
by
)
Union
quackery
''
.

Nor
is
it
an
accident
that
baseball
,
growing
into
the
national
game
in
the
last
75
years
,
has
become
a
microcosm
of
American
life
,
that
learned
societies
such
as
the
American
Folklore
Society
and
the
American
Historical
Association
were
founded
in
the
1880s
,
or
that
courses
in
American
literature
,
American
civilization
,
American
anything
have
swept
our
school
and
college
curricula
.

Such
identification
comes
for
each
group
in
each
crisis
by
rewriting
history
into
legend
and
developing
appropriate
national
heroes
.

But
we
must
never
forget
,
most
of
the
appropriate
heroes
and
their
legends
were
created
overnight
,
to
answer
immediate
needs
,
almost
always
with
conscious
aims
and
ends
.

Therefore
,
the
scholar
,
as
he
looks
at
our
national
folklore
of
the
last
60
years
,
will
be
mindful
of
two
facts
.

Nor
have
we
remembered
that
in
the
melting
pot
of
America
the
hundreds
of
isolated
and
semi-isolated
ethnic
,
regional
and
occupational
groups
did
not
fuse
into
a
homogeneous
national
unit
until
long
after
education
and
industrialization
had
caused
them
to
cast
oral
tradition
aside
as
a
means
of
carrying
culturally
significant
material
.

That
much
of
what
he
calls
folklore
is
the
result
of
beliefs
carefully
sown
among
the
people
with
the
conscious
aim
of
producing
a
desired
mass
emotional
reaction
to
a
particular
situation
or
set
of
situations
is
irrelevant
.

Unfortunately
,
few
of
the
artists
(
writers
,
movie
producers
,
dramatists
and
musicians
)
who
have
used
American
folklore
since
1900
have
known
enough
to
distinguish
between
the
two
streams
even
in
the
most
general
of
ways
.

They
have
widely
varying
backgrounds
and
aims
.

The
outlook
for
the
amateur
,
for
instance
,
is
usually
dependent
on
his
fondness
for
local
history
or
for
the
picturesque
.

His
love
of
folklore
has
romanticism
in
it
,
and
he
doesn't
care
much
about
the
dollar-sign
or
the
footnote
.

Fundamentally
,
both
these
types
,
the
amateur
and
the
collector
,
are
uncritical
and
many
of
them
don't
distinguish
well
between
real
folklore
and
bogus
material
.

As
a
result
,
most
people
don't
have
more
than
a
vague
idea
what
folklore
actually
is
;
;

And
so
well
is
such
ignorance
preserved
by
the
amateur
and
the
money-maker
that
even
at
the
college
level
most
of
the
hundred-odd
folklore
courses
given
in
the
United
States
survive
on
sentiment
and
nationalism
alone
.

This
has
not
,
however
,
prevented
publishers
from
labeling
him
a
``
folk
poet
''
,
simply
because
he
is
a
rural
one
.

He
had
no
apparent
comprehension
of
morality
;
;

Landesco
thought
him
``
just
a
superior
sort
of
plugugly
''
but
he
was
,
in
fact
,
with
his
aggression
and
hostility
,
and
nerveless
indifference
to
risking
or
administering
pain
,
a
casebook
psychopath
.

He
had
been
a
choir
boy
at
the
Holy
Name
Cathedral
and
also
served
as
an
acolyte
to
Father
O'Brien
.

He
then
got
a
job
with
the
Chicago
Herald-Examiner
as
a
circulation
slugger
,
a
rough
fighter
employed
to
see
that
his
paper's
news
pitches
were
not
trespassed
upon
by
rival
vendors
.

Those
were
his
only
interludes
behind
bars
,
although
he
collected
four
more
charges
on
his
police
record
in
1921
and
1922
,
three
for
burglary
and
one
for
robbery
.

the
jury
wanted
better
evidence
than
that
and
he
was
acquitted
,
at
a
cost
of
$30,000
in
bribes
,
it
was
estimated
.

As
promptly
as
Torrio
,
O'Banion
jumped
into
bootlegging
.

He
conducted
it
with
less
diplomacy
and
more
spontaneous
violence
than
the
Sicilians
,
but
he
had
his
huge
North
Side
portion
to
exploit
and
he
made
a
great
deal
of
money
.

But
whose
requirements
?
?

It
was
an
interesting
fraternisation
of
ex-convicts
,
union
racketeers
,
ward
heelers
,
sold-out
officials
,
and
gunmen
.

This
dinner
was
the
start
of
a
new
blatancy
in
the
relationship
between
the
gangs
and
the
politicians
,
which
,
prior
to
1924
,
says
Pasley
,
``
had
been
maintained
with
more
or
less
stealth
''
,
but
which
henceforth
was
marked
by
these
ostentatious
gatherings
,
denounced
by
a
clergyman
as
``
Belshazzar
feasts
''
,
at
which
``
politicians
fraternized
cheek
by
jowl
with
gangsters
,
openly
,
in
the
big
downtown
hotels
''
.

However
,
this
inaugural
feast
did
its
sponsors
no
good
whatever
.

On
Election
Day
--
November
4
--
he
energetically
marshalled
his
force
of
bludgeon
men
,
bribers
,
and
experts
in
forging
repeat
votes
.

This
further
demonstration
of
O'Banion's
ballooning
power
did
not
please
Torrio
and
Capone
.

he
was
neither
prosecuted
nor
even
arrested
.

Upon
which
the
detective
bureau
despatched
rifle
squads
to
prevent
trouble
if
O'Banion
should
send
his
gunmen
out
to
deal
with
the
hijacking
policemen
.

He
says
he
don't
want
no
trouble
''
.

But
Torrio
and
Capone
had
graver
cause
to
hate
and
distrust
the
Irishman
.

A
tsunami
may
be
started
by
a
sea
bottom
slide
,
an
earthquake
or
a
volcanic
eruption
.

Japan
has
had
15
destructive
ones
(
eight
of
them
disastrous
)
since
1596
.

In
1707
an
earthquake
in
Japan
generated
waves
so
huge
that
they
piled
into
the
Inland
Sea
;
;

one
wave
swamped
more
than
1,000
ships
and
boats
in
Osaka
Bay
.

The
dimensions
of
these
waves
dwarf
all
our
usual
standards
of
measurement
.

This
is
followed
by
a
tremendous
suck
of
water
away
from
the
shore
as
the
first
great
trough
arrives
.

At
Hilo
large
numbers
of
people
ran
out
to
inspect
the
amazing
spectacle
of
the
denuded
beach
.

Usually
the
third
to
the
eighth
waves
in
the
series
are
the
biggest
.

Such
equipment
has
been
installed
at
Hilo
,
Midway
,
Attu
and
Dutch
Harbor
.

Since
the
1946
disaster
there
have
been
15
tsunami
in
the
Pacific
,
but
only
one
was
of
any
consequence
.

At
17:07
that
afternoon
(
Greenwich
time
)
the
shock
was
recorded
by
the
seismograph
alarm
in
Honolulu
.

While
accounts
of
the
progress
of
the
tsunami
came
in
from
various
points
in
the
Pacific
(
Midway
reported
it
was
covered
with
nine
feet
of
water
)
,
the
Hawaiian
station
made
its
calculations
and
notified
the
military
services
and
the
police
that
the
first
big
wave
would
arrive
at
Honolulu
at
23:30
Greenwich
time
.

It
turned
out
that
the
waves
were
not
so
high
as
in
1946
.

They
hurled
a
cement
barge
against
a
freighter
in
Honolulu
Harbor
,
knocked
down
telephone
lines
,
marooned
automobiles
,
flooded
lawns
,
killed
six
cows
.

The
land
,
too
,
is
changing
,
and
earthquakes
are
daily
reminders
of
this
.

and
everywhere
can
be
found
scars
of
earlier
breaks
once
deeply
buried
.

These
waves
have
shown
that
1,800
miles
below
the
surface
a
liquid
core
begins
,
and
that
it
,
in
turn
,
has
a
solid
inner
core
.

(

)
As
far
down
as
400
miles
below
the
surface
the
material
should
be
hot
enough
to
be
plastic
and
adjust
itself
to
twisting
forces
by
sluggish
flow
rather
than
by
breaking
,
as
rigid
surface
rocks
do
.

Knowledge
gained
from
studying
earthquake
waves
has
been
applied
in
various
fields
.

At
twelve
minutes
after
five
on
the
morning
of
Wednesday
,
April
18
,
1906
,
San
Francisco
was
shaken
by
a
severe
earthquake
.

A
sharp
tremor
was
followed
by
a
jerky
roll
.

In
Ireland's
County
Limerick
,
near
the
River
Shannon
,
there
is
a
quiet
little
suburb
by
the
name
of
Garryowen
,
which
means
``
Garden
of
Owen
''
.

Bursting
from
the
lips
of
a
charging
cavalry
trooper
was
the
last
sound
heard
on
this
earth
by
untold
numbers
of
Cheyennes
,
Sioux
and
Apaches
,
Mexican
banditos
under
Pancho
Villa
,
Japanese
in
the
South
Pacific
,
and
Chinese
and
North
Korean
Communists
in
Korea
.

But
don't
tell
that
to
a
veteran
of
the
Fighting
Seventh
,
especially
in
a
saloon
on
Saturday
night
.

Though
he
knew
no
more
about
military
science
and
tactics
than
any
other
desk
officer
,
he
managed
to
get
transferred
to
the
combat
forces
.

Chandler
understood
this
and
expected
the
worst
.

Instead
Sergeant
Early
was
quiet
,
sharp
and
confident
.

For
example
,
it
was
a
battalion
of
the
7th
Cavalry
under
Colonel
George
Armstrong
Custer
that
had
been
wiped
out
at
the
Battle
of
The
Little
Big
Horn
.

But
what
made
the
load
lighter
was
the
realization
that
every
officer
,
non-com
and
trooper
was
ready
and
willing
to
help
him
carry
it
,
for
the
good
of
the
troop
and
the
regiment
.

The
final
proof
was
a
small
incident
.

It
happened
at
the
St.
Patrick's
Day
party
,
a
big
affair
for
a
regiment
which
had
gone
into
battle
for
over
three-quarters
of
a
century
to
the
strains
of
an
Irish
march
.

The
troop
received
a
new
leader
,
Lieutenant
Robert
M.
Carroll
,
fresh
out
of
ROTC
and
bucking
for
Regular
Army
status
.

Carroll
was
sharp
and
military
,
but
he
was
up
against
tough
competition
for
that
RA
berth
,
and
he
wanted
to
play
it
cool
.

The
enemy
had
filtered
across
the
river
during
the
night
and
a
full
force
of
1000
men
,
armed
with
Russian
machine
guns
,
attacked
the
position
held
by
Chandler's
men
.

They
came
in
waves
.

Chandler
left
Carroll
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
to
direct
any
reinforcements
he
could
find
to
the
fight
.

Then
Mel
Chandler
started
up
the
hill
.

Burst
from
his
throat
.

Enemy
reinforcements
came
pouring
down
,
seeking
a
soft
spot
.

He
turned
to
his
platoon
.

``
Okay
,
men
''
,
he
said
.

For
an
instant
his
men
hesitated
,
unable
to
believe
that
their
lieutenant
,
the
most
popular
officer
in
the
regiment
,
was
dead
.

From
the
enlisted
men
he
pistol-whipped
to
the
subordinate
officer
whose
wife
he
tried
to
rape
,
a
lot
of
men
had
plenty
of
reason
heartily
to
dislike
Marcus
Reno
.

He
was
a
member
of
The
Fighting
Seventh
.

Assumption
1
.

Assumption
2
.

Proximate
in
the
sense
that
there
are
more
distant
,
more
``
positive
''
ends
we
seek
,
to
which
victory
over
Communism
is
but
a
means
.

But
dominant
in
the
sense
that
every
other
objective
,
no
matter
how
worthy
intrinsically
,
must
defer
to
it
.

Peace
is
a
worthy
objective
;
;

but
if
granting
self-determination
to
the
Algerian
rebels
entails
sweeping
that
area
into
the
Sino-Soviet
orbit
,
then
Algerian
freedom
must
be
postponed
.

but
if
providing
higher
standards
of
living
gets
in
the
way
of
producing
sufficient
guns
to
resist
Communist
aggression
,
then
material
sacrifices
and
denials
will
have
to
be
made
.

The
uses
of
power

This
much
having
been
said
,
the
question
remains
whether
we
have
the
resources
for
the
job
we
have
to
do
--
defeat
Communism
--
and
,
if
so
,
how
those
resources
ought
to
be
used
.

This
brings
us
squarely
to
the
problem
of
power
,
and
the
uses
a
nation
makes
of
power
.

One
was
demonstrably
false
;
;

I
have
often
searched
for
a
graphic
way
of
impressing
our
superiority
on
those
Americans
who
have
doubts
,
and
I
think
Mr.
Jameson
Campaigne
has
done
it
well
in
his
new
book
American
Might
And
Soviet
Myth
.

Only
the
vain
and
incurably
sentimental
among
us
will
lose
sleep
simply
because
foreign
peoples
are
not
as
impressed
by
our
strength
as
they
ought
to
be
.

This
ignorant
estimate
,
I
repeat
,
is
not
of
any
interest
in
itself
;
;

And
is
Western
influence
greater
or
less
than
it
used
to
be
?
?

The
second
stage
is
to
retain
the
nominal
classification
of
``
neutralist
''
,
while
in
fact
turning
the
country
into
an
active
advocate
and
adherent
of
Soviet
policy
.

Six
years
ago
French
Indochina
,
though
in
troubie
,
was
in
the
Western
camp
.

Laos
is
teetering
between
Communism
and
pro-Communist
neutralism
;
;

Today
,
Africa
is
swerving
violently
away
from
the
West
and
plunging
,
it
would
seem
,
into
the
Soviet
orbit
.

There
was
the
Polish
Revolution
which
we
misunderstood
and
then
helped
guide
along
a
course
favorable
to
Soviet
interests
.

The
first
rattle
of
the
machine
guns
,
at
7:10
in
the
evening
,
roused
around
me
the
varied
voices
and
faces
of
fear
.

The
young
man
spoke
steadily
enough
,
but
all
at
once
he
looked
grotesquely
unshaven
.

Then
the
lights
went
out
.

To
my
room
?
?

``
Please
''
,
she
said
,
``
please
''
.

Had
the
Communist-led
Pathet
Lao
finally
come
this
far
?
?

``
Let's
play
hero
''
,
I
said
.

A
restaurant
posted
a
reminder
to
patrons
``
who
became
excited
and
left
without
paying
their
checks
''
.

And
no
wonder
,
for
Vientiane
,
the
old
City
of
Sandalwood
,
had
become
the
City
of
Bullet
Holes
.

I
saw
holes
in
planes
at
the
airport
and
in
cars
in
the
streets
.

Throughout
the
land
their
hit-and-run
terrorists
spread
fear
of
ambush
and
death
.

``
And
it's
all
the
more
tragic
because
it's
so
little
deserved
''
,
said
Mr.
J.
J.
A.
Frans
,
a
Belgian
official
of
the
United
Nations
Educational
,
Scientific
,
and
Cultural
Organization
.

We
talked
after
I
hailed
his
Jeep
marked
with
the
U.N.
flag
.

They
spread
over
an
area
no
larger
than
Oregon
;
;

yet
they
include
peoples
as
different
from
one
another
as
Oregonians
are
from
Patagonians
.

The
Royal
Lao
Army
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
paid
and
equipped
with
American
funds
.

To
find
out
,
we
traveled
throughout
that
part
of
Laos
still
nominally
controlled
,
in
the
daytime
at
least
,
by
the
Royal
Lao
Army
:
from
Attopeu
,
the
City
of
Buffalo
Dung
in
the
southeast
,
to
Muong
Sing
,
the
City
of
Lions
in
the
northwest
,
close
to
Communist
China
(
map
,
page
250
)
.

In
the
end
we
ran
into
Communist
artillery
fire
.

Although
we
enjoyed
our
rounds
of
the
government
offices
in
Vientiane
,
with
officials
offering
tea
and
pleasing
conversation
in
French
,
we
were
getting
nowhere
.

Could
we
be
ready
in
15
minutes
?
?

Then
we
drove
on
,
until
there
was
no
more
road
and
we
traversed
dry
rice
fields
,
bouncing
across
their
squat
earth
walls
.

``
We
ask
the
people
what
they
want
,
and
they
supply
the
labor
.

Ask
Mr.
Keo
''
.

Mr.
Keo
agreed
.

But
our
stumping
tour
of
the
south
wasn't
all
misery
.

Briefly
we
rolled
over
a
paved
road
up
to
Pak
Song
,
on
the
cool
Bolovens
Plateau
.

The
Prince
visited
the
hospital
of
Operation
Brotherhood
,
supported
by
the
Junior
Chamber
of
Commerce
of
the
Philippines
,
and
fed
rice
to
two
pet
elephants
he
kept
at
his
residence
at
Pak
Song
.

It
takes
place
in
the
household
,
a
rite
of
well-wishing
for
myriad
occasions
--
for
the
traveler
,
a
wedding
,
a
newborn
child
,
the
sick
,
the
New
Year
,
for
any
good
purpose
.

The
strings
were
draped
around
flowers
in
tall
silver
bowls
(

)
.

I
was
careful
to
keep
my
feet
,
the
seat
of
the
least
worthy
spirits
,
from
pointing
at
anyone's
head
,
where
the
worthiest
spirits
reside
.

Those
souls
like
to
wander
off
,
and
must
be
called
back
.

With
the
divinities
present
and
our
souls
in
place
,
we
were
wished
health
,
happiness
,
and
power
.

John
said
:
``
I
have
some
antiseptic
salve
with
me
,
but
it's
too
late
for
that
''
.

``
Being
Jewish
gives
you
tremendous
drive
''
,
a
boy
remarked
.

``
It
means
that
you
have
to
get
ahead
''
.

When
I
pressed
for
a
purely
religious
definition
,
I
encountered
the
familiar
blend
of
liberal
piety
,
interfaith
good
will
,
and
a
small
residue
of
ethnic
loyalty
.

But
you
don't
have
to
worship
in
the
traditional
way
.

it's
to
be
a
good
person
''
.

When
asked
how
this
was
different
from
being
a
good
Protestant
,
the
boy
answered
,
``
It's
the
same
thing
''
.

The
most
important
aims
of
the
Jewish
students
were
as
follows
:
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
to
live
in
--
30
per
cent
;
;

The
reason
offered
for
clinging
to
the
ancestral
faith
lacked
force
and
authority
even
in
the
teen-agers'
minds
.

Still
another
suggested
that
he
would
join
a
temple
``
for
social
reasons
,
since
I'll
be
living
in
a
suburb
''
.

The
older
teens

This
is
substantially
higher
than
the
figures
for
the
American
population
at
large
--
45.6
per
cent
for
males
and
29.2
per
cent
for
females
.

The
motivations
for
both
sexes
,
to
be
sure
,
are
different
.

The
vocational
motive
is
the
dominant
one
for
boys
,
while
Jewish
girls
attend
college
for
social
reasons
and
to
become
culturally
developed
.

One
of
the
reasons
for
the
high
percentage
of
Jewish
teen-agers
in
college
is
that
a
great
many
urban
Jews
are
enabled
to
attend
local
colleges
at
modest
cost
.

This
is
particularly
true
in
large
centers
of
Jewish
population
like
New
York
,
Chicago
,
and
Philadelphia
.

At
the
same
time
,
there
is
a
good
deal
of
self-congratulation
at
attending
a
good
college
--
they
are
even
inclined
to
exaggerate
its
not
inconsiderable
virtues
--
and
they
express
pleasure
at
the
cozy
in-group
feeling
that
the
college
generates
.

``
They
don't
like
it
if
I
do
anything
away
from
home
.

But
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
some
of
the
new
watering
places
--
Fire
Island
,
Nantucket
,
Westhampton
,
Long
Island
,
for
example
--
tend
to
be
homogeneously
Jewish
.

And
acculturation
into
the
world
at
large
is
likely
to
occur
for
the
Brooklyn
College
student
after
college
rather
than
during
the
four
school
years
.

And
the
school
newspaper
sells
space
to
jubilant
fraternities
,
sororities
,
and
houses
(
in
the
House
Plan
Association
)
that
have
good
news
to
impart
.

The
Brooklyn
College
student
shows
some
striking
departures
from
prevailing
collegiate
models
.

Among
the
boys
,
there
is
very
little
bravado
about
drinking
.

For
galled
breasts
,
the
mother
should
shave
into
half
a
cup
of
fresh
unsalted
lard
enough
white
chalk
to
make
a
paste
.

when
it
was
cool
,
the
fat
was
skimmed
off
and
bottled
.

One
man
,
badly
burned
about
the
face
and
eyes
by
an
arc
welding
torch
,
was
blinded
and
could
not
find
a
doctor
at
the
time
.

Tobacco
was
common
first
aid
.

A
``
chaw
''
of
tobacco
put
on
an
open
wound
was
both
antiseptic
and
healing
.

Tetanus
could
be
avoided
by
pouring
warm
turpentine
over
a
wound
.

Rabies
were
cured
or
prevented
by
``
madstones
''
which
the
pioneer
wore
or
carried
.

the
particle
would
then
move
toward
the
nose
,
where
it
could
be
wiped
out
with
a
wisp
of
cotton
.

Itching
skin
,
considered
``
just
nerves
''
,
was
eased
by
treating
with
whiskey
and
salt
.

Frostbite
was
treated
by
putting
the
feet
and
hands
in
ice
water
or
by
rubbing
them
with
snow
.

Chilblains
were
also
treated
with
tincture
of
capsicum
or
cabbage
leaves
.

Boils
have
always
been
a
source
of
much
trouble
.

A
German
informant
gave
me
a
sure
cure
made
by
combining
rye
flour
and
molasses
into
a
poultice
.

This
was
also
used
for
sores
.

Another
common
cure
was
to
soak
the
feet
five
or
ten
minutes
in
warm
water
,
then
to
apply
a
solution
of
equal
parts
of
soda
and
common
brown
soap
on
a
kid
bandage
overnight
.

Another
was
to
soak
raw
beef
in
vinegar
for
twenty-four
hours
,
tie
it
on
the
wart
,
and
wear
it
for
a
week
.

Pains
in
the
back
of
the
leg
and
in
the
abdomen
were
prevented
from
reaching
the
upper
body
by
tying
a
rope
about
the
patient's
waist
.

It
may
,
on
occasion
,
be
anything
but
that
.

This
is
important
because
,
despite
all
the
efforts
of
the
French
government
,
an
appreciable
segment
of
France's
export
trade
in
wines
is
still
tainted
with
a
misrepresentation
approaching
downright
dishonesty
,
and
there
are
many
too
many
negociants
who
would
rather
turn
a
sou
than
amass
a
creditable
reputation
overseas
.

A
good
negociant
or
shipper
will
not
only
be
the
man
or
the
firm
which
has
cornered
the
wines
from
the
best
vineyards
,
or
the
best
parts
of
them
;
;

Wine
waiters
are
something
else
again
;
;

A
really
good
wine
waiter
is
,
paradoxically
,
the
guardian
(
and
not
the
purveyor
)
of
his
cellar
against
the
Visigoths
.

for
those
who
live
in
a
winter
climate
,
there
is
nothing
better
than
a
bucket
of
water
and
snow
.

In
this
way
,
red
wine
warms
of
itself
quite
rapidly
--
and
though
it
is
true
that
it
may
not
attain
its
potential
of
taste
and
fragrance
until
after
the
middle
of
the
meal
(
or
the
course
)
,
in
the
meantime
it
will
have
run
the
gamut
of
many
beguiling
and
interesting
stages
.

but
the
first
glass
of
Chateau
d'Yquem
or
Montrachet
is
a
great
deal
better
than
the
last
''
!
!

This
does
not
mean
,
though
,
that
a
red
wine
improves
with
prolonged
aeration
:
there
is
a
reasonable
limit
--
and
wines
kept
over
to
the
next
meal
or
the
next
day
,
after
they
have
once
been
opened
,
are
never
as
good
.

If
this
must
be
done
,
they
should
always
be
corked
and
kept
in
a
cool
place
;
;

A
few
red
wines
,
notably
those
of
the
Beaujolais
,
are
better
consumed
at
cellar
temperature
.

In
France
,
when
one
wishes
to
entertain
at
a
restaurant
and
serve
truly
fine
old
red
wines
,
one
visits
the
restaurant
well
ahead
of
time
,
chooses
the
wines
and
,
with
the
advice
of
the
manager
and
his
chef
,
builds
the
menu
around
them
.

Though
there
are
many
exceptions
,
which
we
have
noted
in
preceding
pages
,
white
wine
is
as
a
rule
best
consumed
between
two
and
six
years
old
,
and
red
wines
,
nowadays
,
between
three
and
ten
.

Most
of
the
wines
of
Beaujolais
,
on
the
other
hand
,
should
be
drunk
while
very
young
;
;

Giffen
lost
no
time
in
visiting
the
plantation
.

The
slaves
appeared
to
be
in
good
health
and
at
work
under
John
Palfrey's
overseer
.

If
William
wished
to
continue
operations
for
a
year
,
why
not
simply
leave
the
Negroes
undisturbed
and
pay
them
``
as
high
wages
to
remain
there
as
are
ever
paid
the
labor
of
persons
of
their
sex
&
age
.

If
not
,
he
was
willing
to
accede
to
William's
wishes
in
any
way
that
did
not
block
his
ultimate
aim
.

William
was
adamant
on
one
point
:
under
no
circumstances
would
he
allow
the
Negroes
to
remain
on
the
plantation
with
his
and
Henry's
slaves
if
they
were
told
of
their
coming
freedom
.

If
Palfrey
ever
had
any
doubts
about
the
wickedness
of
slavery
,
they
were
put
aside
after
he
received
an
inventory
of
the
slave
property
he
had
inherited
.

This
cold
reckoning
of
human
worth
in
a
legal
paper
,
devoid
of
compassion
or
humanity
,
was
all
he
needed
.

Each
human
being
,
known
only
by
a
given
name
,
had
a
cash
value
.

Giffen
extracted
one
concession
from
William
:
the
house
servants
could
be
free
at
any
time
Gorham
thought
expedient
.

According
to
state
law
a
slave
had
to
be
at
least
thirty
years
old
before
he
could
be
freed
.

On
March
11
the
Louisiana
legislature
voted
unanimously
to
table
the
petition
.

When
Giffen
decided
to
charge
him
interest
on
the
loan
from
John
Palfrey
,
Gorham
readily
assented
,
vowing
that
in
a
matter
of
dollars
and
cents
,
his
brothers
would
never
have
any
cause
to
complain
of
him
.

Palfrey
told
his
wife
of
his
intentions
for
the
first
time
,
and
left
for
New
Orleans
apprehensively
invoking
a
special
blessing
of
Providence
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
see
his
family
again
.

During
his
journey
Palfrey
stopped
off
to
see
two
abolitionists
.

In
both
cases
he
desired
information
about
placing
the
freedmen
in
homes
once
they
arrived
in
the
North
.

Instead
of
the
expected
``
annoyances
''
due
to
the
nature
of
his
mission
,
he
received
many
calling
cards
and
invitations
from
``
gentlemen
of
mark
,
on
whom
I
had
no
sort
of
claim
,
&
have
had
many
more
invitations
than
I
could
accept
''
.

He
later
told
abolitionist
Edmund
Quincy
of
the
``
marked
attention
and
civility
''
with
which
the
New
Orleans
gentlemen
and
the
upriver
planters
greeted
him
.

He
had
a
short
private
talk
with
each
adult
slave
.

the
slaves
were
to
remain
as
wage
laborers
for
his
account
.

The
plantation
was
sold
in
January
,
1845
,
and
Palfrey
thought
the
new
owner
ought
to
pay
his
people
two
months'
wages
.

On
March
21
,
1845
the
bark
Bashaw
weighed
anchor
at
New
Orleans
,
while
on
the
levee
Henry
and
William
Palfrey
waved
farewell
to
their
father's
former
chattels
who
must
have
looked
back
at
the
receding
shore
with
mingled
regret
and
jubilation
.

Not
all
of
Palfrey's
slaves
were
aboard
the
Bashaw
.

Giffen
had
advised
that
it
would
not
be
too
difficult
to
obtain
freedom
locally
for
the
old
house
servants
.

Two
of
these
were
included
in
Palfrey's
lot
.

An
eyewitness
recalled
how
awkward
the
red-turbaned
colored
women
appeared
as
they
curtseyed
in
the
church
doorway
,
and
the
diffidence
the
former
slaves
displayed
while
they
listened
to
the
few
words
that
declared
them
free
.

Many
of
the
new
appointees
are
art
collectors
.

Walton
,

paratroopers
during

soul

One
tempest
was
stirred
up
last
March
when
Udall
announced
that
an
eight-and-a-half-foot
bronze
statue
of
William
Jennings
Bryan
,
sculpted
by
the
late
Gutzon
Borglum
,
would
be
sent
``
on
indefinite
loan
''
to
Salem
,
Illinois
,
Bryan's
birthplace
.

They
dug
up
a
speech
he
had
made
two
years
earlier
as
a
Congressman
,
decrying
the
more
than
two
hundred
statues
,
monuments
,
and
memorials
which
``
dot
the
Washington
landscape
as
patriotic
societies
and
zealous
friends
are
constantly
hatching
new
plans
''
.

eleven
others
were
introduced
.

Active
warfare
is
raging
between
the
forces
pressing
for
a
monument
to
the
first
Roosevelt
on
Theodore
Roosevelt
Island
in
the
Potomac
,
and
TR.'s
own
living

,
who
wish
to
preserve
the
island
as
a
wildlife
sanctuary
.

``
Washington
''
,
President
Kennedy
has
been
heard
to
remark
ironically
,
``
is
a
city
of
southern
efficiency
and
northern
charm
''
.

One
of
Mrs.
Kennedy's
initial
concerns
as
First
Lady
was
the
sad
state
of
the
furnishings
in
a
building
which
is
supposed
to
be
a
national
shrine
.

Not
long
after
moving
in
she
turned
up
a
richly
carved
desk
,
hewed
from
the
timbers
of
the
British
ship
H.M.S.
Resolute
and
presented
to
President
Hayes
by
Queen
Victoria
.

The
press
releases
emanating
from
the
White
House
give
a
clue
to
the
activity
within
.

Secretary
and
Mrs.
Dillon
have
contributed
enough
pieces
of
Empire
furniture
,
including
Dolley
Madison's
own
sofa
,
to
furnish
a
room
in
that
style
.

Woman's
place
is
in
the
home
:
man
must
attend
to
matters
of
the
yard
.

While
a
Senator
,
Kennedy
had
unsuccessfully
pushed
a
bill
to
preserve
the
Belasco
Theater
,
as
well
as
the
Dolley
Madison
and
the
Benjamin
Taylor
houses
,
all
scheduled
for
razing
.

Logically
,
it
should
be
moved
downtown
.

On
delving
deeper
,
Walton
discovered
that
most
of
the
buildings
fronting
the
Square
could
be
classified
as
``
early
nondescript
''
.

The
Dolley
Madison
House
,
Walton
concluded
,
was
scarcely
worth
preserving
.

The
Dartmouth
student
does
not
live
in
monastic
seclusion
,
as
he
once
did
.

But
his
is
still
a
simple
life
relatively
free
of
the
female
presence
or
influence
,
and
he
must
go
far
,
even
though
he
may
go
fast
,
for
sophisticated
pleasures
.

He
is
by
no
means
the
country
boy
he
might
have
been
in
the
last
century
,
down
from
the
hills
with
bear
grease
on
his
hair
and
a
zeal
for
book
learning
in
his
heart
.

The
men's
shops
on
Hanover's
Main
Street
compare
favorably
with
those
in
Princeton
and
New
Haven
.

And
the
automobiles
that
stream
out
of
Hanover
each
weekend
,
toward
Smith
and
Wellesley
and
Mount
Holyoke
,
are
no
less
rakish
than
those
leaving
Cambridge
or
West
Philadelphia
.

But
there
has
always
been
an
outdoor
air
to
Dartmouth
.

This
carefree
disdain
for
``
side
''
cropped
up
again
in
the
same
television
broadcast
.

So
he
kissed
her
.

Since
the
days
when
their
two
thousand
pairs
of
skis
outnumbered
those
assembled
anywhere
else
in
the
United
States
,
the
students
have
stopped
regarding
the
Olympic
Ski
Team
as
another
name
for
their
own
.

The
Lodge
,
built
of
hand-hewn
virgin
spruce
,
can
handle
fifty
people
for
dining
,
sleeping
,
or
lounging
in
its
huge
living
room
.

The
club
runs
regular
trips
to
the
cabins
,
but
many
of
the
students
prefer
to
take
off
in
small
unofficial
groups
for
a
weekend
of
hunting
,
fishing
,
climbing
,
or
skiing
.

Under
the
auspices
of
the
Outing
Club
,
Dartmouth
also
has
the
Mountaineering
Club
,
which
takes
on
tough
climbs
like
Mount
McKinley
,
and
Bait
&
Bullet
,
whose
interests
are
self-evident
,
and
even
sports
a
Woodman's
Team
,
which
competes
with
other
New
England
colleges
in
wood
sawing
and
chopping
,
canoe
races
,
and
the
like
.

City
boys
find
a
lot
of
learning
in
the
feel
of
an
ax
handle
or
in
the
sharp
tang
of
a
sawmill
,
come
upon
suddenly
in
a
backwoods
logging
camp
.

There
is
much
to
be
said
for
such
a
college
--
and
Dartmouth
men
have
been
accused
of
saying
it
too
often
and
too
loudly
.

In
an
age
of
oratory
,
he
was
the
king
of
orators
,
and
both
he
himself
and
Chief
Justice
Marshall
were
bathed
in
manly
tears
,
as
Uncle
Dan'l
reached
his
thundering
climax
:

and
also
of
English
Youth
and
any
others
''
.

The
cook
got
drunk
,
and
President
Wheelock
proved
to
be
a
man
of
broad
talents
by
carving
the
ox
himself
.

Future
commencements
were
more
decorous
perhaps
,
but
the
number
of
graduates
increased
from
the
original
four
at
a
relatively
slow
pace
.

By
1907
the
number
of
undergraduates
had
risen
to
1,107
.

And
at
his
last
commencement
,
in
that
year
,
Dr.
Tucker
and
Dartmouth
were
honored
by
the
presence
of
distinguished
academic
visitors
attesting
to
the
new
stature
of
the
college
.

But
it
has
achieved
a
cross-section
of
students
from
almost
all
the
states
,
and
two-thirds
of
its
undergraduates
come
from
outside
New
England
.

It
is
still
,
however
,
the
junior
member
of
the
League
,
if
not
in
years
at
least
in
the
catching
up
it
has
had
to
do
.

Today
it
espouses
certain
ideas
in
its
curriculum
that
other
institutions
might
consider
somewhat
breathtaking
.

The
person
who
left
the
buggy
there
has
never
been
identified
.

It
was
a
busy
street
,
conveniently
near
the
shopping
center
,
and
unattended
horses
and
wagons
were
often
left
at
the
curbside
.

There
are
,
of
course
,
many
weaknesses
in
any
case
against
Emma
.

She
didn't
like
her
stepmother
,
but
nothing
is
known
to
have
occurred
shortly
before
the
crime
that
could
have
caused
such
a
murderous
rage
.

If
she
avoided
the
train
and
hired
a
buggy
,
the
stableman
might
have
recognized
her
.

A
few
years
ago
,
not
too
long
before
his
death
,
Phillips
revealed
in
a
newspaper
story
that
he
had
always
suspected
Morse
of
the
murders
.

The
New
Bedford
Standard-Times
has
reported
Knowlton
as
saying
,
long
after
the
trial
,
that
if
he
only
knew
what
Borden
said
during
his
conversation
with
Morse
,
he
would
have
convicted
``
somebody
''
.

Fall
River
police
did
go
to
Westport
to
see
if
they
could
get
any
information
against
Morse
and
possibly
find
an
accomplice
whom
he
might
have
hired
from
among
these
men
.

These
officers
found
no
incriminating
information
.

He
said
he
returned
from
the
visit
to
his
niece
on
the
11:20
streetcar
.

If
this
woman
had
delayed
until
after
11:20
to
start
her
shopping
,
she
would
have
had
little
time
in
which
to
prepare
the
substantial
meal
that
was
eaten
at
dinner
in
those
days
.

It
is
possible
that
Morse
told
the
woman
it
was
11:20
,
but
it
could
have
been
earlier
,
since
she
did
serve
dinner
on
time
.

They
interviewed
the
conductor
of
the
streetcar
Morse
said
he
had
taken
,
but
the
man
did
not
remember
Morse
as
a
passenger
.

He
met
nobody
he
knew
on
this
walk
.

She
said
it
was
after
she
returned
from
her
vomiting
spell
in
the
back
yard
that
Mrs.
Borden
told
her
to
wash
the
windows
.

He
knew
the
house
fairly
well
,
he
had
been
there
on
two
previous
visits
during
the
past
three
or
four
months
alone
.

What
did
Pearson
say
about
Bridget
Sullivan
as
a
possible
suspect
in
his
trial-book
essay
?
?

indeed
,
it
was
probably
to
Mr.
Morse's
advantage
to
have
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Borden
alive
.

The
exoneration
Pearson
speaks
of
is
not
an
exoneration
,
but
Lizzie's
expression
of
her
opinion
,
as
reported
in
the
testimony
of
Assistant
Marshal
Fleet
.

Fleet
asked
the
same
question
about
Bridget
,
and
Lizzie
pointed
out
that
as
far
as
she
knew
Bridget
had
gone
up
to
her
room
before
her
father's
murder
and
came
down
when
she
called
her
.

Asked
who
this
was
,
she
named
Harrington
.

Her
statement
certainly
was
true
;
;

``
How
about
Bridget
Sullivan
''
?
?

Kirby
was
,
of
course
,
reflecting
the
opinion
that
existed
at
the
time
of
murders
.

True
,
it
is
no
longer
cricket
for
the
butler
to
be
the
killer
in
mystery
fiction
,
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
actual
people
in
real
life
and
not
imaginary
characters
and
situations
.

The
actions
of
Bridget
should
be
examined
,
since
she
was
there
and
opportunity
did
exist
,
if
only
to
establish
her
innocence
.

The
legend
as
it
exists
in
Fall
River
today
always
includes
the
solemn
assurance
that
Bridget
returned
to
Ireland
after
the
trial
with
a
``
big
bundle
''
of
cash
which
Lizzie
gave
her
for
keeping
her
mouth
shut
.

Her
father
,
James
Upton
,
was
the
Upton
mentioned
by
Hawthorne
in
the
famous
introduction
to
the
Scarlet
Letter
as
one
of
those
who
came
into
the
old
custom
house
to
do
business
with
him
as
the
surveyor
of
the
port
.

Her
mother
also
was
a
person
of
superior
mind
and
broad
interests
.

She
possessed
an
observant
eye
,
a
retentive
memory
,
and
a
critical
faculty
.

But
even
so
Lucy
could
not
give
up
her
intellectual
pursuits
.

When
her
brother
Winslow
became
a
student
at
Brown
University
in
1874
,
she
wrote
him
about
a
course
in
history
he
was
taking
under
Professor
Diman
:
``
What
is
Prof.
Diman's
definition
of
civilization
,
and
take
the
world
through
,
is
its
progress
ever
onward
,
or
does
it
retrograde
at
times
?
?

She
read
Maitland's
Dark
Ages
,
``
which
I
enjoyed
very
much
''
;
;

And
it
was
Lucy
Upton
who
first
started
the
idea
of
a
regular
course
in
Music
at
Spelman
College
.

and
after
1883
,
was
professor
of
astronomy
at
Brown
University
.

While
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
Lucy
Upton
held
positions
in
the
U.S.
Census
Office
,
and
in
the
Pension
Bureau
.

After
the
months
in
Europe
,
she
returned
to
Boston
and
became
active
in
church
and
community
life
.

She
served
for
a
number
of
years
without
pay
beyond
her
travel
and
maintenance
.

her
great
love
of
flowers
and
plants
and
birds
;
;

Under
Miss
Upton
,
the
work
of
the
year
1909-10
went
forward
without
interruption
.

Both
had
eager
and
inquiring
minds
;
;

At
the
Fifteenth
Anniversary
(
1896
)
as
already
quoted
,
Miss
Upton
projected
with
force
and
eloquence
the
Spelman
of
the
Future
as
a
college
of
first
rank
,
with
expanding
and
unlimited
horizons
.

At
the
meeting
of
the
Board
of
Trustees
,
on
March
3
,
1910
,
Miss
Upton
presented
the
annual
report
of
the
President
.

that
the
enrollment
showed
an
increase
of
boarding
students
as
was
desired
;
;

With
the
Fund
in
hand
,
the
debt
on
the
boilers
had
been
paid
;
;

Two
bequests
were
recorded
:
one
of
$200
under
the
will
of
Mrs.
Harriet
A.
Copp
of
Los
Angeles
;
;

and
one
of
$2,000
under
the
will
of
Miss
Celia
L.
Brett
of
Hamilton
,
New
York
,
a
friend
from
the
early
days
.

The
removal
of
Miss
Packard
18
years
earlier
had
caused
them
great
sorrow
,
but
they
still
had
Miss
Giles
.

and
when
school
closed
,
she
was
unable
to
travel
to
Massachusetts
.

The
``
diversified
occupations
''
program
is
a
part-time
trade-preparatory
program
conducted
over
two
school
years
on
a
cooperative
basis
between
the
school
and
local
industrial
and
business
employers
.

When
there
is
employment
opportunity
for
youth
,
this
arrangement
--
or
lack
of
arrangement
--
works
out
quite
well
.

Indeed
,
in
some
periods
of
our
history
and
in
some
neighborhoods
the
job
opportunities
have
been
so
good
that
undoubtedly
a
great
many
boys
who
were
potential
members
of
the
professions
quit
school
at
an
early
age
and
went
to
work
.

However
,
the
teacher
can
only
go
so
far
if
the
attitude
of
the
community
and
the
family
is
anti-intellectual
.

I
believe
the
situation
is
improving
,
but
the
success
stories
need
to
be
heavily
publicized
.

I
should
like
to
underline
four
points
I
made
in
my
first
report
with
respect
to
vocational
education
.

First
and
foremost
,
vocational
courses
should
not
replace
courses
which
are
essential
parts
of
the
required
academic
program
for
graduation
.

they
realize
the
relevance
of
what
they
are
learning
to
their
future
careers
,
and
this
sense
of
purpose
is
carried
over
to
the
academic
courses
which
they
are
studying
at
the
same
time
.

Practically
all
of
these
practical
skills
are
of
such
a
nature
that
a
degree
of
mastery
can
be
obtained
in
high
school
sufficient
to
enable
the
youth
to
get
a
job
at
once
on
the
basis
of
the
skill
.

Of
course
,
it
can
be
argued
that
an
ability
to
write
English
correctly
and
with
some
degree
of
elegance
is
a
marketable
skill
.

In
this
respect
,
public
education
in
the
large
cities
differs
from
education
in
the
smaller
cities
and
consolidated
school
districts
.

The
reason
is
that
there
is
a
lack
of
interest
on
the
part
of
the
community
.

Therefore
employment
and
education
in
all
the
schools
in
a
metropolitan
area
are
related
in
different
ways
from
those
which
are
characteristic
of
the
comprehensive
high
school
described
in
my
first
report
.

``
He'll
have
no
difficulty
''
,
I
was
told
.

The
soybean
seed
is
the
most
important
leguminous
food
in
the
world
.

The
residue
from
soybean
processing
goes
mainly
into
animal
feeds
.

They
are
used
mainly
for
their
oil
.

The
efficiency
with
which
animals
convert
grains
and
forages
to
meat
has
risen
steadily
in
the
United
States
since
the
1930's
and
has
paralleled
the
increased
feeding
of
the
cake
and
meal
that
are
a
byproduct
when
seeds
are
processed
for
oil
.

Seeds
of
soybean
,
cotton
,
corn
,
sesame
,
and
rape
yield
semidrying
oils
.

This
nondrying
oil
,
however
,
is
now
more
in
demand
than
ever
before
as
a
fine
lubricant
,
as
a
constituent
of
fluids
for
hydraulically
operated
equipment
,
and
as
a
source
of
chemicals
to
make
plastics
.

Sizable
amounts
of
soybean
,
coconut
,
and
palm
kernel
oil
--
seed
oils
that
are
produced
primarily
for
food
purposes
--
also
are
used
to
make
soaps
,
detergents
,
and
paint
resins
.

Starch
is
used
in
the
paper
,
textile
,
and
food-processing
industries
and
in
a
multitude
of
other
manufacturing
operations
.

of
psyllium
seed
,
more
than
2.6
million
.

Once
regarded
as
an
agricultural
nuisance
,
psyllium
was
sold
in
the
1930's
as
a
mechanical
laxative
under
117
different
brands
.

Locust
gum
is
added
to
pulp
slurries
to
break
up
the
lumps
of
fibers
in
making
paper
.

Coconuts
,
the
fruit
of
the
coconut
palm
,
have
the
largest
of
all
known
seeds
and
are
grown
in
South
Pacific
islands
as
a
crop
for
domestic
and
export
markets
.

World
production
of
copra
,
the
oil-bearing
flesh
of
the
coconut
,
was
a
little
more
than
3
million
tons
in
1959
.

Exports
from
producing
countries
in
terms
of
equivalent
oil
were
a
little
more
than
1
million
tons
,
about
half
of
which
was
palm
kernels
or
oil
from
them
and
about
half
was
palm
oil
.

the
marking
nut
,
used
for
ink
and
varnish
;
;

The
so-called
vegetable
ivory
is
the
hard
endosperm
of
the
egg-sized
seed
.

Since
Biblical
times
,
rosaries
have
been
made
from
jobs-tears
--
the
seeds
of
an
Asiatic
grass
.

Less
common
seeds
used
in
cooking
and
beverages
include
fenugreek
(
artificial
maple
flavor
)
and
cardamom
.

Coffee
is
made
from
the
roasted
and
ground
seeds
of
the
coffee
tree
.

World
production
of
coffee
broke
all
previous
records
in
1959
and
1960
at
more
than
5
million
tons
.

Cocoa
,
chocolate
,
and
cocoa
butter
come
from
the
ground
seeds
of
the
cacao
tree
.

Several
soft
drinks
contain
extracts
from
kola
nuts
,
the
seed
of
the
kola
tree
cultivated
in
the
West
Indies
and
South
America
.

The
Japanese
sake
is
wine
fermented
from
rice
grain
.

Seeds
furnish
about
40
percent
of
the
total
nutrients
consumed
by
all
livestock
.

Hay
and
pasture
are
the
other
chief
sources
of
livestock
feed
.

The
value
of
products
from
these
industries
was
15.8
billion
dollars
,
of
which
about
one-third
was
created
by
manufacturing
processes
.

To
hold
a
herd
of
cattle
on
a
new
range
till
they
felt
at
home
was
called
``
locatin'
''
'em
.

Cattle
were
inclined
to
remain
in
a
territory
with
which
they
were
acquainted
.

Followin'
such
an
event
there
was
usually
a
harvest
of
``
fallen
hides
''
,
and
the
ranchers
needed
skinnin'
knives
instead
of
brandin'
irons
.

This
word
was
first
applied
to
the
imported
hot-blooded
cattle
,
but
later
was
more
commonly
used
as
reference
to
a
human
tenderfoot
.

``
Dry
stock
''
denoted
,
regardless
of
age
or
sex
,
such
bovines
as
were
givin'
no
milk
.

The
terminology
of
the
range
,
in
speakin'
of
``
dry
stock
''
and
``
wet
stock
''
,
was
confusin'
to
the
tenderfoot
.

The
most
common
reference
to
``
wet
stock
''
was
with
the
meanin'
that
such
animals
had
been
smuggled
across
the
Rio
Grande
after
bein'
stolen
from
their
rightful
owners
.

The
cow
,
unlike
a
bull
or
steer
,
kept
her
eyes
open
and
her
mind
on
her
business
when
chargin'
,
and
a
cow
``
on
the
prod
''
or
``
on
the
peck
''
was
feared
by
the
cowhand
more
than
any
of
his
other
charges
.

Listenin'
with
wonder
at
the
strange
words
of
the
bullwhackers
as
they
shouted
``
Whoa
''
,
``
Haw
''
,
and
``
Gee
''
,
they
thought
them
words
the
names
of
the
animals
,
and
began
callin'
cattle
``
wohaws
''
.

``
Sabinas
''
was
a
Spanish
word
used
to
describe
cattle
of
red
and
white
peppered
and
splotched
colorin'
.

The
northern
cowboy
called
all
the
red
Mexican
cattle
which
went
up
the
trail
``
Sonora
reds
''
,
while
they
called
all
cattle
drove
up
from
Mexico
``
yaks
''
,
because
they
came
from
the
Yaqui
Injun
country
,
or
gave
'em
the
name
of
``
Mexican
buckskins
''
.

Near
the
southern
border
,
cattle
of
the
early
longhorn
breed
whose
coloration
was
black
with
a
lineback
,
with
white
speckles
frequently
appearin'
on
the
sides
and
belly
,
were
called
``
zorrillas
''
.

An
animal
with
distinct
coloration
,
or
other
marks
easily
distinguished
and
remembered
by
the
owner
and
his
riders
,
was
sometimes
used
as
a
``
marker
''
.

Countin'
each
grazin'
bunch
of
cattle
where
it
was
found
on
the
range
and
driftin'
it
back
so
that
it
didn't
mix
with
the
uncounted
cattle
was
called
a
``
range
count
''
.

A
``
book
count
''
was
the
sellin'
of
cattle
by
the
books
,
commonly
resorted
to
in
the
early
days
,
sometimes
much
to
the
profit
of
the
seller
.

When
a
cowhand
said
that
a
man
had
``
good
cow
sense
''
,
he
meant
to
pay
'im
a
high
compliment
.

Then
they
picked
up
the
smaller
black
specks
on
the
plain
in
front
of
him
.

The
dogs
were
working
a
trail
--
lion
?
?

Jones
was
galloping
close
behind
them
leaning
down
,
cheering
them
on
.

It
came
from
the
top
of
the
Reef
not
half
a
mile
away
.

At
the
base
of
the
rocky
hillside
,
they
left
their
horses
and
climbed
on
foot
.

Nice
country
to
meet
a
lion
in
face
to
face
.

Ulyate
drew
back
with
a
start
,
and
put
finger
to
lips
,
almost
afraid
to
move
or
whisper
lest
it
set
her
off
,
``
The
dogs
have
got
her
bayed
.

Why
she
doesn't
charge
him
,
I
don't
know
.

Jones
had
been
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
from
her
when
he
first
broke
through
to
the
top
of
the
Reef
.

She
whirled
and
faced
him
,
roaring
terribly
,
and
Ulyate
,
watching
through
the
leaves
,
could
not
understand
why
she
did
not
charge
and
obliterate
him
,
because
he
wouldn't
have
much
of
a
chance
of
getting
away
,
in
that
thick
growth
,
but
she
seemed
just
a
trace
uncertain
;
;

From
the
lioness'
point
of
view
,
this
strange
creature
on
the
back
of
another
creature
,
lashing
out
with
its
long
thin
paw
,
very
likely
appeared
as
something
she
could
not
at
first
cope
with
.

But
now
she
sank
lower
to
the
rock
.

Just
the
tip
of
her
tail
was
moving
as
she
crouched
,
and
she
was
treading
lightly
up
and
down
with
her
hind
feet
.

But
she
clung
to
the
rocks
and
brush
,
and
the
day
wore
away
.

The
dogs
were
tired
.

Loveless
,
too
,
objected
.

Means
spit
and
edged
on
.

However
nothing
on
four
legs
was
supposed
to
be
faster
than
a
lion
over
a
short
distance
,
unless
it
was
a
cheetah
.

She
charged
.

For
thirty
yards
she
gained
rapidly
.

A
Western
cowpony
had
outrun
an
African
lion
,
from
a
standing
start
.

No
one
knew
exactly
.

Tossing
his
rope
and
shouting
he
attracted
her
attention
.

The
Christian
education
of
children
,
too
,
was
once
hardly
more
than
a
sideshow
,
but
the
day
came
when
a
congregation
that
did
not
assume
full
oversight
of
a
church
school
was
thought
of
as
failing
in
its
duty
.

The
most
serious
weakness
of
the
ecumenical
movement
today
is
that
it
is
generally
regarded
as
the
responsibility
of
a
few
national
leaders
in
each
denomination
and
a
few
interdenominational
executives
.

How
far
the
fellowship
in
most
local
churches
falls
below
what
the
New
Testament
means
by
koinonia
!
!

What
is
now
called
Christian
fellowship
is
often
little
more
than
the
social
chumminess
of
having
a
gracious
time
with
the
kind
of
people
one
likes
.

It
is
an
experience
of
a
new
depth
of
community
derived
from
an
awareness
of
the
corporate
indwelling
of
Christ
in
His
people
.

The
local
and
the
ecumenical
are
one
.

Divergent
perspectives

With
great
difficulty
he
made
his
way
from
his
native
Hungary
to
Geneva
to
renew
his
contacts
as
a
member
of
the
Provisional
Committee
for
the
World
Council
of
Churches
.

They
were
bifocals
.

The
gap
between
the
ecumenical
perspective
and
the
parish
perspective
appears
most
starkly
in
a
church
in
any
of
our
comfortable
suburbs
.

It
has
a
beautiful
edifice
.

It
helps
children
grow
up
with
at
least
a
nodding
acquaintance
with
the
Bible
.

We
shall
not
make
a
decisive
advance
in
the
ecumenical
movement
until
such
a
church
begins
to
see
itself
not
merely
as
a
haven
of
comfort
and
peace
but
as
a
base
of
Christian
witness
and
mission
to
the
world
.

Desiring
to
fill
the
only
remaining
lack
,
he
selected
the
best
site
on
the
ranch
for
a
chapel
and
spared
no
expense
in
erecting
it
.

``
Why
,
no
,
ma'am
''
,
he
replied
,
``
this
church
belongs
to
me
''
!
!

There
must
first
be
a
deeper
sense
that
the
church
belongs
not
to
us
but
to
Christ
,
and
that
it
is
His
purpose
,
not
our
own
interests
and
preferences
,
that
determines
what
it
is
to
be
and
do
.

Every
pitch
in
the
game
brought
forth
a
howl
from
the
enraptured
audience
and
every
fly
ball
the
visitors
dropped
(
and
because
their
right
fielder
was
still
a
little
fuzzy
from
drink
,
they
dropped
many
)
called
forth
yelps
of
derision
.

When
the
visitors
,
after
losing
this
game
,
rode
along
the
village
streets
toward
home
,
the
youngsters
who
could
keep
abreast
of
them
for
a
moment
or
two
screamed
triumphantly
,
``
You
bunch
of
hay-shakers
!
!

You
hay-shakers
''
!
!

Radio
broadcasts
had
not
begun
and
most
devotees
of
baseball
attended
the
games
near
home
,
in
the
town
park
or
a
pasture
,
with
perhaps
two
or
three
trips
to
the
city
each
season
to
see
the
Cubs
or
the
Pirates
or
the
Indians
or
the
Red
Sox
.

Other
hitters
bloomed
with
more
or
less
vigor
in
the
news
and
a
few
even
dared
to
dream
of
matching
Ruth
,
who
was
still
called
Jidge
by
all
his
friends
,
or
Leo
or
Two-Head
by
those
who
dared
to
taunt
him
(
Leo
was
the
name
of
the
ball
player
he
liked
the
least
)
and
who
called
most
of
the
world
``
Kid
''
.

He
was
given
to
public
carousing
and
to
acting
the
clown
on
the
diamond
;
;

(
This
made
a
sportswriter
named
Pegler
wonder
in
print
if
Art
had
worn
this
armament
when
he
defeated
his
manager
.

or
who
ingested
strange
objects
,
like
live
fish
;
;

or
who
undertook
to
set
records
for
remaining
erect
on
a
dance
floor
,
with
or
without
a
partner
;
;

While
fifty
years
before
,
Albert
Goodwill
Spalding
,
secretary
of
the
Chicago
Ball
Club
of
the
National
League
,
could
write
earnestly
to
the
manager
of
the
Buffalo
club
and
request
a
guarantee
of
one
hundred
dollars
for
a
baseball
game
in
August
,
in
this
Golden
Era
a
game
at
the
Yankee
Stadium
might
bring
in
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
at
the
gate
.

And
while
less
than
ten
years
earlier
the
wayward
Black
Sox
--
all
of
them
top
performers
in
their
positions
--
had
toiled
for
stingy
Charles
Comiskey
at
salaries
ranging
from
twenty-five
hundred
dollars
to
forty-five
hundred
dollars
a
year
,
stars
now
were
asking
ten
thousand
dollars
,
twenty
thousand
dollars
,
yes
,
even
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
season
.

Boston
fans
sometimes
liked
to
wring
some
wry
satisfaction
out
of
the
fact
that
most
of
the
great
1923-27
crew
were
graduates
of
the
Red
Sox
--
sold
to
millionaires
Huston
and
Ruppert
by
a
man
who
could
not
deny
them
their
most
trifling
desire
.

Ruth
himself
,
still
owning
his
farm
in
Massachusetts
and
an
interest
in
the
Massachusetts
cigar
business
that
printed
his
round
boyish
face
on
the
wrappers
,
had
led
the
parade
down
from
Fenway
Park
,
followed
by
pitchers
Carl
Mays
,
Leslie
``
Joe
''
Bush
,
Waite
Hoyt
,
Herb
Pennock
,
and
Sam
Jones
,
catcher
Wally
Schang
,
third
baseman
Joe
Dugan
(
who
completed
the
``
playboy
trio
''
of
Ruth
,
Dugan
,
and
Hoyt
)
,
and
shortstop
Everett
Scott
.

By
1926
,
when
the
mighty
Yanks
were
at
their
mightiest
,
only
a
few
of
these
were
left
but
they
still
shone
brightest
,
even
beside
able
and
agile
rookies
like
Tony
Lazzeri
(
who
managed
never
to
have
one
of
his
epileptic
fits
on
the
field
)
,
Mark
Koenig
,
Lou
Gehrig
,
George
Pipgras
,
and
gray-thatched
Earl
Combs
.

The
ball
lay
there
,
shining
white
on
the
grass
in
view
of
nearly
every
fan
in
the
park
while
Ruth
,
red-necked
with
frustration
,
charged
about
the
small
patch
of
ground
screaming
,
``
Where's
the
--
-ing
ball
''
?
?

But
,
as
he
snarled
unhappily
when
the
inning
was
over
,
``
not
a
sonofabitch
in
the
place
would
tell
me
''
,
so
little
Tommy
ran
all
the
way
home
.

Radio
broadcasts
,
however
--
now
that
even
plain
people
could
afford
``
loud
speakers
''
on
their
sets
--
held
old
fans
to
the
major-league
races
and
attracted
new
ones
,
chiefly
women
,
who
through
what
the
philosopher
called
the
ineluctable
modality
of
audition
,
became
first
inured
,
then
attracted
,
then
addicted
to
the
long
afternoon
recitals
of
the
doings
in
some
distant
baseball
park
.

This
had
a
pleasant
effect
upon
the
Sunday
gate
receipts
as
well
as
upon
the
intake
of
the
rail
and
bus
companies
,
some
of
which
began
to
offer
special
excursion
rates
,
including
seats
at
the
park
,
just
as
the
trolley
and
ferry
companies
had
when
baseball
was
new
.

for
every
grown
man
(
except
a
few
who
were
always
suspected
of
being
shy
on
virility
)
knew
at
least
the
fundamentals
of
baseball
,
just
as
every
male
American
in
this
era
liked
to
imagine
(
or
pretend
)
that
he
could
fight
with
his
fists
.

Radio
,
however
,
so
increased
the
interest
of
women
in
the
game
that
it
was
hardly
necessary
even
to
have
``
Ladies'
Days
''
any
longer
to
enable
men
to
get
to
the
ball
park
without
interference
at
home
.

Hypothesizing
a
series
of
developmental
stages
that
begin
in
the
individual's
infancy
and
end
in
his
old
age
,
Erikson
has
indicated
that
the
adolescent
is
faced
with
a
series
of
identity
crises
.

The
successful
and
positive
resolution
of
these
crises
during
adolescence
involves
an
epigenetic
principle
--
during
adolescence
,
the
individual's
positive
resolutions
in
each
area
of
identity
crisis
depend
,
to
a
considerable
degree
,
on
his
already
having
resolved
preliminary
and
preparatory
identity
crises
during
his
infancy
,
childhood
,
and
early
adolescence
.

Erikson
has
noted
that
,
unless
this
trust
developed
early
,
the
time
ambivalence
experienced
,
in
varying
degree
and
temporarily
,
by
all
adolescents
(
as
a
result
of
their
remembering
the
more
immediate
gratification
of
wants
during
childhood
,
while
not
yet
having
fully
accepted
the
long-range
planning
required
by
adulthood
)
may
develop
into
a
more
permanent
sense
of
time
diffusion
.

Others
displayed
utter
apathy
and
indifference
to
any
decision
about
the
past
or
the
future
.

A
sense
of
self-certainty
and
the
freedom
to
experiment
with
different
roles
,
or
confidence
in
one's
own
unique
behavior
as
an
alternative
to
peer-group
conformity
,
is
more
easily
developed
during
adolescence
if
,
during
early
childhood
,
the
individual
was
permitted
to
exercise
initiative
and
encouraged
to
develop
some
autonomy
.

However
,
if
the
child
has
been
constantly
surrounded
,
during
nursery
and
early
school
age
,
by
peer
groups
;
;

inculcated
with
the
primacy
of
group
acceptance
and
group
standards
;
;

The
attitudes
of
some
unwed
mothers
quoted
in
Chapter
2
,
,
revealed
both
considerable
preoccupation
with
being
accepted
by
others
and
a
marked
absence
of
self-certainty
.

but
very
few
seemed
aware
that
such
acceptance
and
identification
need
to
be
supplemented
with
more
enduring
and
stable
identification
of
and
with
one's
self
.

These
childhood
experiences
are
sources
of
the
self-certainty
that
the
adolescent
needs
,
for
experimenting
with
many
roles
,
and
for
the
freedom
to
fail
sometimes
in
the
process
of
exploring
and
discovering
her
skills
and
abilities
.

If
she
has
not
had
such
experiences
,
the
female's
normal
adolescent
degree
of
indecision
will
be
compounded
.

whether
to
pursue
a
college
education
or
a
job
after
high
school
;
;

This
paralysis
may
be
expressed
in
the
female's
starting
--
and
never
completing
--
many
jobs
,
tasks
,
and
courses
of
study
;
;

The
excerpts
from
case
histories
presented
above
confirm
this
significance
,
though
through
different
facets
of
experience
.

In
discussing
the
ways
this
crisis
is
germane
to
consderations
for
the
prevention
of
illegitimacy
,
we
shall
again
superimpose
Erikson's
concept
on
our
data
.

The
positive
development
,
during
adolescence
,
of
this
capacity
to
think
and
to
feel
strongly
and
with
increasing
independence
,
and
to
identify
overtly
either
with
or
against
given
ideas
,
values
,
and
practices
,
depends
to
a
considerable
degree
on
both
previous
and
present
opportunities
for
developing
autonomy
,
initiative
,
and
self-certainty
.

and
they
censured
parents
who
``
never
disciplined
and
were
too
permissive
''
or
who
``
never
explained
how
easy
it
was
to
get
pregnant
''
.

In
the
adult
world
,
there
are
a
number
of
rather
general
and
diffuse
sources
of
ideological
diffusion
that
further
compound
the
adolescent's
search
for
meaning
during
this
particular
identity
crisis
.

He
cited
the
elephantine
dimensions
of
the
Selden
case
record
;
;

the
duplication
of
testimony
and
exhibits
;
;

the
``
objections
stated
at
outrageous
length
''
;
;

The
fundamental
difficulty
of
which
the
Selden
case
was
``
a
striking
(
though
not
singular
)
example
''
,
concluded
Hough
,
``
will
remain
as
long
as
testimony
is
taken
without
any
authoritative
judicial
officer
present
,
and
responsible
for
the
maintenance
of
discipline
,
and
the
reception
or
exclusion
of
testimony
''
.

Inventors
joined
lawyers
in
the
clamor
for
reform
,
inevitably
centering
upon
the
Selden
litigation
as
a
``
horrible
example
''
.

Its
costive
deliberations
were
likened
to
those
of
the
British
courts
of
chancery
mercilessly
caricatured
by
Dickens
in
Bleak
House
.

``
I
am
satisfied
that
in
the
Selden
case
had
this
power
existed
and
this
course
(
been
)
pursued
,
it
would
have
shortened
the
depositions
of
some
of
the
experts
nearly
one-half
and
of
some
of
the
other
witnesses
thereto
more
than
that
''
.

The
revised
procedure
was
acclaimed
as
a
long-overdue
reform
.

One
of
the
A.L.A.M.
lawyers
observed
that
if
the
Selden
case
had
been
tried
under
this
simplified
procedure
,
the
testimony
which
filled
more
than
a
score
of
volumes
,
``
at
a
minimum
cost
of
$1
a
page
for
publication
alone
,
could
have
been
contained
in
one
volume
''
.

There
is
little
doubt
that
they
were
promulgated
by
the
Supreme
Court
as
a
direct
result
of
the
Selden
patent
suit
.

3

The
trade
bodies
which
came
in
the
wake
of
the
A.L.A.M.
were
more
representative
,
for
they
never
adopted
a
policy
of
exclusion
.

In
this
tangle
of
conflicting
claims
,
the
patent-sharing
scheme
adopted
by
the
A.L.A.M.
at
its
founding
proved
to
be
the
best
device
for
avoiding
or
mitigating
the
burdens
of
incessant
litigation
.

But
Henry
Ford
used
the
planetary
transmission
in
his
Model
T
and
earlier
cars
and
,
in
1905
,
as
a
precautionary
measure
,
took
out
a
license
from
the
man
who
claimed
to
be
its
inventor
.

It
was
commonplace
for
auto
makers
,
parts-suppliers
,
and
dealers
to
find
warning
notices
and
threats
of
infringement
suits
in
their
daily
mail
.

By
that
time
it
was
commonly
agreed
that
patent
warfare
was
sapping
constructive
achievement
and
blocking
the
free
exchange
of
technical
information
.

With
the
other
members
of
the
patents
committee
--
Wilfred
C.
Leland
,
Howard
E.
Coffin
,
Windsor
T.
White
,
and
W.
H.
Vandervoort
--
Hanch
drafted
a
cross-licensing
agreement
whose
essential
feature
of
royalty-free
licensing
was
his
own
contribution
.

It
will
be
recalled
that
in
his
summation
for
the
A.L.A.M.
before
Judge
Hough
,
Fish
had
condemned
patent
litigation
as
the
curse
of
the
American
industrial
community
.

The
eloquent
persuasions
of
Fish
guaranteed
the
adoption
of
the
plan
by
the
members
of
the
automotive
trade
association
.

On
the
wall
of
this
square
there
are
delightful
bas-reliefs
of
musical
instruments
.

Twenty-two
thousand
spectators
used
to
crowd
it
in
Roman
days
.

Andrea
Palladio
,
an
Italian
architect
of
the
sixteenth
century
,
modeled
his
designs
on
its
Doric
and
Ionic
columns
.

Climb
the
steps
from
the
theatre
to
the
Via
Della
Tribuna
Di
Campitelli
for
an
even
better
view
of
the
Columns
of
Apollo
.

Before
you
enter
the
palazzo
,
note
Francesco
Borromini's
facade
.

The
large
statue
on
the
first
floor
is
believed
to
be
the
statue
of
Pompey
at
the
base
of
which
Julius
Caesar
was
stabbed
to
death
(
if
so
,
the
statue
once
stood
in
the
senate
house
)
.

Today
,
by
contrast
it
is
a
lively
and
colorful
fruit
,
vegetable
,
and
flower
market
.

Opera
lovers
will
be
interested
to
learn
that
this
church
was
the
scene
for
the
first
act
of
Tosca
.

From
the
seventeenth
to
the
nineteenth
century
it
was
a
popular
practice
to
flood
the
piazza
in
the
summer
,
and
the
aristocrats
would
then
ride
around
the
inundated
square
in
their
carriages
.

The
scene
before
you
is
indeed
theatrical
and
often
appears
in
movies
about
Rome
.

In
front
of
you
is
the
Palazzo
Madama
,
once
belonging
to
the
Medici
and
now
the
Italian
Senate
.

You
are
now
facing
the
Pantheon
,
the
largest
and
best-preserved
building
still
standing
from
the
days
of
ancient
Rome
.

The
Pantheon's
interior
,
still
in
its
original
form
,
is
truly
majestic
and
an
architectural
triumph
.

Its
rotunda
forms
a
perfect
circle
whose
diameter
is
equal
to
the
height
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
.

A
few
yards
farther
,
on
the
Via
Dei
Bergamaschi
,
is
the
Piazza
Colonna
.

You
are
now
at
the
Corso
,
though
narrow
,
one
of
Rome's
busiest
streets
.

Either
here
,
or
in
one
of
the
modest
restaurants
nearby
,
is
just
the
place
to
end
this
first
walk
through
the
heart
of
Rome
.

He
,
too
,
believes
in
good
intentions
and
is
astounded
and
offended
when
they
are
not
taken
for
the
deed
.

One
day
,
to
everyone's
astonishment
,
someone
drops
a
match
in
the
powder
keg
and
everything
blows
up
.

Before
the
dust
has
settled
or
the
blood
congealed
,
editorials
,
speeches
,
and
civil-rights
commissions
are
loud
in
the
land
,
demanding
to
know
what
happened
.

Negroes
want
to
be
treated
like
men
:
a
perfectly
straightforward
statement
,
containing
only
seven
words
.

People
who
have
mastered
Kant
,
Hegel
,
Shakespeare
,
Marx
,
Freud
,
and
the
Bible
find
this
statement
utterly
impenetrable
.

I
once
tried
to
describe
to
a
very
well-known
American
intellectual
the
conditions
among
Negroes
in
the
South
.

They
do
not
escape
Jim
Crow
:
they
merely
encounter
another
,
not-less-deadly
variety
.

The
pressure
within
the
ghetto
causes
the
ghetto
walls
to
expand
,
and
this
expansion
is
always
violent
.

The
world
has
never
lacked
for
horrifying
examples
;
;

Personally
,
it
is
the
Southerner's
sexual
coming
of
age
,
when
,
without
any
warning
,
unbreakable
taboos
are
set
up
between
himself
and
his
past
.

Everything
,
thereafter
,
is
permitted
him
except
the
love
he
remembers
and
has
never
ceased
to
need
.

The
resulting
,
indescribable
torment
affects
every
Southern
mind
and
is
the
basis
of
the
Southern
hysteria
.

It
seems
to
be
indispensable
to
the
national
self-esteem
that
the
Negro
be
considered
either
as
a
kind
of
ward
(
in
which
case
we
are
told
how
many
Negroes
,
comparatively
,
bought
Cadillacs
last
year
and
how
few
,
comparatively
,
were
lynched
)
,
or
as
a
victim
(
in
which
case
we
are
promised
that
he
will
never
vote
in
our
assemblies
or
go
to
school
with
our
kids
)
.

Stevenson's
speech
,
and
the
spectacular
disturbance
in
the
gallery
,
were
both
touched
off
by
the
death
,
in
Katanga
,
the
day
before
,
of
Patrice
Lumumba
.

Stevenson
stated
,
in
the
course
of
his
address
,
that
the
United
States
was
``
against
''
colonialism
.

I
was
curious
about
the
impact
of
this
political
assassination
on
Negroes
in
Harlem
,
for
Lumumba
had
--
has
--
captured
the
popular
imagination
there
.

I
was
curious
to
know
if
Lumumba's
death
,
which
is
surely
among
the
most
sinister
of
recent
events
,
would
elicit
from
``
our
''
side
anything
more
than
the
usual
,
well-meaning
rhetoric
.

The
first
question
is
:
Would
I
like
to
live
here
?
?

As
long
as
audiences
came
to
see
the
movement
,
there
seemed
little
reason
to
adventure
further
.

Motion-picture
exhibitions
took
place
in
stores
in
a
general
atmosphere
like
that
of
the
penny
arcade
which
can
still
be
found
in
such
urban
areas
as
Times
Square
.

the
headsman

his

the

;

An
early
film
by
a
competitor
of
the
Wizard
of
Menlo
Park
simply
showed
a
long
kiss
performed
by
two
actors
of
the
contemporary
stage
.

The
discovery
that
movies
are
a
form
of
fiction
was
made
in
the
early
years
of
this
century
and
it
was
made
chiefly
by
two
men
,
a
French
magician
,
Georges
Melies
,
and
an
American
employee
of
Edison
,
Edwin
S.
Porter
.

Immediately
,
the
film
improved
and
it
improved
because
in
narrative
it
found
a
content
based
on
time
to
complement
its
own
unbreakable
connection
with
time
.

The
``
moving
''
picture
of
the
train
or
the
wave
coming
at
the
audience
is
,
to
be
sure
,
more
intense
than
a
still
picture
of
the
same
subject
,
but
the
difference
is
really
one
of
degree
;
;

Each
scene
is
shot
straight
through
,
as
had
been
the
universal
custom
,
from
a
camera
fixed
in
a
single
position
,
but
in
the
outdoor
scenes
,
especially
in
the
capture
and
destruction
of
the
outlaws
,
Porter's
camera
position
breaks
,
necessarily
,
with
the
camera
position
standard
until
then
,
which
had
been
,
roughly
,
that
of
a
spectator
in
a
center
orchestra
seat
at
a
play
.

The
plane
of
the
action
in
the
scene
is
not
parallel
with
the
plane
of
the
film
in
the
camera
or
on
the
screen
.

In
that
apparently
simple
shift
Porter
opened
the
way
to
the
sensitive
use
of
the
camera
as
an
instrument
of
art
as
well
as
a
mechanical
recording
device
.

He
revealed
the
potential
value
of
the
``
cut
''
as
the
basic
technique
in
the
art
of
the
film
.

The
``
chase
''
as
a
standard
film
device
probably
dates
from
The
Great
Train
Robbery
,
and
there
is
a
reason
for
the
continued
popularity
of
the
device
.

The
chase
in
itself
is
a
narrative
;
;

Not
surprisingly
,
this
approach
did
not
work
.

But
no
art
at
all
was
born
of
the
art
effort
in
the
early
movies
.

they
mix
middle-class
people
with
lower-class
residents
.

in
fact
,
a
contrast
is
often
drawn
in
this
regard
with
the
``
impersonal
''
Roman
Catholic
parish
.

The
rule
of
economic
integration
in
congregational
life
can
be
seen
in
the
missionary
outreach
of
the
major
denominations
.

There
is
much
talk
in
theological
circles
about
the
``
Church
as
Mission
''
and
the
``
Church's
Mission
''
;
;

If
economic
integration
really
shapes
congregational
life
,
then
evangelism
should
be
a
process
of
extending
economic
integration
.

In
a
sample
of
new
members
of
Pittsburgh
churches
,
almost
60
per
cent
were
recruited
by
initial
``
contacts
with
friendly
members
''
.

the
lay
ministry
is
a
means
to
recruit
like-minded
people
who
will
strengthen
the
social
class
nucleus
of
the
congregation
.

economic
integration
and
co-optation
are
the
two
methods
by
which
Protestants
associate
with
and
recruit
from
the
neighborhood
.

The
fact
that
metropolitan
churches
of
the
major
denominations
have
moved
approximately
every
generation
for
the
last
hundred
years
becomes
somewhat
more
intelligible
in
the
light
of
this
struggle
to
maintain
economic
balance
.

Soon
they
will
fight
their
way
into
the
lower
middle-class
suburbs
,
and
the
churches
will
experience
the
same
decay
and
rebuilding
cycle
which
has
characterized
their
history
for
a
century
.

The
identification
of
the
basic
unit
of
religious
organization
--
the
parish
or
congregation
--
with
a
residential
area
is
self-defeating
in
a
modern
metropolis
,
for
it
simply
means
the
closing
of
an
iron
trap
on
the
outreach
of
the
Christian
fellowship
and
the
transmutation
of
mission
to
co-optation
.

This
interpretation
of
the
role
of
residence
in
the
economy
of
middle-class
culture
could
lead
to
various
projections
for
the
churches
.

this
style
is
characteristically
an
expression
of
the
communal
style
of
the
middle
classes
.

The
keynotes
of
this
style
are
activism
and
emphasis
on
achievements
in
gaining
self-esteem
.

Its
contents
are
another
matter
,
for
they
reveal
the
kinds
of
interests
pursued
by
the
congregation
.

They
adopted
a
program
by
which
Louisiana
was
divided
into
five
districts
.

Fort
Toulouse
,
on
the
Alabama
River
,
had
been
erected
in
1714
for
trade
with
the
Alabamas
and
Choctaws
,
but
money
was
available
for
only
one
other
new
post
,
near
the
present
Nashville
,
Tennessee
,
and
this
was
soon
abandoned
.

The
habitants
were
to
be
encouraged
to
trade
and
were
to
dispose
of
their
pelts
to
the
concessionaires
.

The
Conseil
even
treated
the
serious
matter
of
British
aggression
as
its
business
and
,
on
its
own
authority
,
sent
to
disaffected
savages
merchandise
``
suitable
for
the
peltry
trade
''
.

De
La
Laude
,
commander
of
the
Alabama
post
,
had
the
friendship
of
the
natives
,
and
was
able
to
make
them
look
upon
the
British
as
poor
competitors
.

He
became
,
after
a
time
,
commander
of
a
post
on
the
Alabama
River
,
but
his
operations
extended
from
Mobile
throughout
the
district
,
and
he
finally
obtained
a
monopoly
of
the
Indian
trade
.

To
hold
them
was
an
essential
part
of
French
policy
,
for
they
controlled
the
upper
termini
of
the
routes
from
the
north
to
Mobile
.

They
threatened
constantly
to
give
the
British
a
hold
on
this
region
,
from
whence
they
could
move
easily
down
the
rivers
to
the
French
settlements
near
the
Gulf
.

The
Company
of
the
Indies
promised
to
send
over
a
supply
of
Indian
trading
goods
,
and
to
price
them
more
cheaply
in
terms
of
deerskins
.

But
the
Company
of
the
Indies
,
holding
to
its
program
of
economy
,
made
no
arrangements
to
furnish
better
goods
at
attractive
prices
.

To
the
directors
the
problem
appeared
a
matter
of
intrigue
or
diplomacy
.

D'Artaguette
went
vigorously
to
work
,
and
gave
credit
to
many
hunters
.

With
the
loss
of
the
Mobile
trade
,
which
ended
all
profits
from
Louisiana
,
the
Natchez
Indians
revolted
.

They
destroyed
a
trading
house
and
pillaged
the
goods
,
and
harassed
French
shipping
on
the
Mississippi
.

In
January
,
1731
,
the
company
asked
the
crown
to
relieve
it
of
the
government
of
the
colony
.

Company
rule
in
Louisiana
left
the
colony
without
fortifications
,
arms
,
munitions
,
or
supplies
.

The
difficulties
of
trade
had
ruined
many
voyageurs
,
and
numbers
of
them
had
gone
to
live
with
the
natives
and
rear
half-blood
families
.

Others
left
the
country
,
and
there
was
no
one
familiar
with
the
Indian
trade
.

If
this
trade
should
be
resumed
,
the
habitants
who
had
come
to
be
farmers
or
artisans
,
and
soldiers
discharged
from
the
army
,
must
be
hardened
to
the
severe
life
of
coureurs
de
bois
.

This
was
a
slow
and
difficult
course
,
and
French
trade
suffered
from
the
many
mistakes
of
the
new
group
of
traders
.

He
reported
,
too
,
that
among
the
habitants
there
were
none
of
probity
and
ability
sufficient
to
justify
entrusting
them
with
the
King's
goods
.

With
no
company
to
interfere
,
he
kept
close
control
over
all
the
traders
.

They
would
not
be
pleased
to
have
it
published
back
home
that
they
planned
a
frolic
in
Paris
or
Hong
Kong
at
the
Treasury's
expense
.

They
would
be
particularly
displeased
with
the
State
Department
if
it
were
the
source
of
such
reports
.

Few
things
are
more
perilous
for
the
State
Department
than
a
displeased
congressman
.

The
farmers
may
be
aroused
if
Congress
cuts
into
the
Agriculture
Department's
budget
.

the
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
assaults
upon
the
Treasury
.

With
all
these
agencies
,
the
congressman
must
constantly
check
the
political
wind
and
trim
his
sails
accordingly
.

The
Department
expects
and
receives
no
thanks
from
Congress
for
its
discretion
.

State
is
expected
to
arrange
the
touring
Cicero's
foreign
itinerary
;
;

embassy
workers
are
expected
to
entertain
him
according
to
his
whim
,
frequently
with
their
savings
for
the
children's
college
tuition
.

Nothing
worked
.

They
didn't
.

The
Department's
constant
fight
with
the
House
for
money
is
a
polite
minuet
compared
with
its
periodic
bloody
engagements
with
the
Senate
.

Where
Acheson
had
fought
a
gallant
losing
battle
for
the
Department
,
Dulles
fed
the
crocodile
with
his
subordinates
.

He
elected
to
``
get
along
''
.

They
range
from
the
Soviet
Embassy
on
Sixteenth
Street
,
a
gray
shuttered
pile
suggesting
a
funeral-accessories
display
house
,
to
what
Congressman
Rooney
has
called
``
that
monstrosity
on
Thirty-fourth
Street
''
,
the
modern
cement-and-glass
chancery
of
the
Belgians
.

The
Soviet
Embassy
is
popularly
regarded
as
Russian
espionage
headquarters
.

Where
they
had
affected
the
bleak
social
style
of
embalmers'
assistants
,
Menshikov
went
abroad
gorgeous
in
white
tie
and
tails
.

Overnight
he
became
the
most
available
man
in
Washington
.

A
newspaperman
who
met
him
at
a
reception
swore
that
he
asked
Menshikov
:
``
What
should
we
call
you
''
?
?

Toasting
in
champagne
one
night
at
the
embassy
,
he
hoisted
his
glass
to
a
senator's
wife
and
gaily
cried
:
``
Up
your
bottom
''
!
!

Rumor
had
it
that
his
children
numbered
in
the
hundreds
.

The
State
Department
was
little
help
on
this
,
or
on
much
else
about
Saudi
Arabia
.

The
size
of
Saud's
family
was
still
being
debated
when
the
King
appeared
for
his
first
meeting
with
Eisenhower
.

When
it
ended
,
a
dusky
sheik
in
desert
robes
flowed
into
Hagerty's
office
to
report
on
the
interview
.

The
sheik
smiled
and
murmured
:
``
That
is
precisely
correct
''
.

Finally
he
reported
that
Nasser
was
ready
to
make
a
concrete
commitment
in
return
for
Israeli
concessions
.

I
know
now
why
our
Japanese
friends
were
surprised
when
they
walked
into
our
bathroom
.

The
dances
were
as
beautiful
as
anything
I
have
ever
seen
--
they
rival
the
New
York
Rockettes
for
scenery
and
precision
as
well
as
imagination
.

Because
Don
was
leaving
the
next
day
,
I
spent
the
evening
with
him
at
Asia
Center
.

The
following
morning
Mr.
Morikawa
called
for
me
,
and
we
went
to
visit
schools
--
kindergarten
,
middle-school
,
elementary
school
,
and
high
school
--
Mr.
Yoshimoto's
school
.

There
is
much
more
freedom
in
the
schools
here
than
I
expected
--
some
think
too
much
.

With
the
loss
of
the
Emperor
diety
in
Japan
,
the
people
are
left
in
confusion
with
no
God
or
moral
teachings
that
have
strength
.

Parents
indulge
their
children
.

The
government
has
recognized
the
dilemma
and
is
beginning
to
devise
some
moral
education
for
the
schools
--
but
the
teachers
often
have
no
firm
conviction
and
are
confused
.

I
think
I
would
have
been
much
disappointed
in
Japan
if
I
had
not
seen
Kyoto
,
Nara
,
and
Hiroshima
.

I
arrived
at
7:00
a.m.
and
by
9:00
a.m.
I
had
finished
breakfast
and
was
on
my
way
to
see
what
they
had
planned
.

We
walked
miles
and
saw
various
shrines
and
gardens
.

We
visited
the
Okamoto
home
--
where
for
the
first
time
I
saw
the
famous
tea
ceremony
.

Even
though
we
had
walked
miles
in
Kyoto
that
day
,
we
started
out
again
to
see
Nara
at
night
.

One
spot
in
Osaka
I
shall
always
remember
--
the
bridge
where
we
stood
to
watch
the
reflections
of
the
elaborate
neon
signs
in
the
still
waters
of
the
river
.

I
had
planned
to
go
to
the
hotel
by
taxi
and
sleep
a
little
,
after
which
Mr.
Uno
would
arrive
and
pilot
me
around
.

I
was
grateful
for
their
insight
into
my
need
for
this
experience
.

Tokyo

It
was
thrilling
to
see
the
effect
of
an
American-trained
teacher
on
Japanese
students
in
a
class
in
Home
Planning
.

I
am
told
the
time
will
soon
come
when
women
will
find
it
necessary
to
do
most
of
their
own
work
,
and
even
now
it
is
important
to
have
conveniences
for
the
use
of
servants
.

They
learn
how
to
take
care
of
children
and
sick
members
of
the
family
.

Although
the
training
is
only
for
one
month
,
it
is
intensive
and
thorough
.

University
of
Tokyo

But
for
it
to
be
just
to
attain
this
same
result
by
means
of
the
force
of
a
boycott
throughout
the
nation
would
require
the
verification
of
facts
contrary
to
those
assumed
in
the
foregoing
case
.

Then
the
boycott
would
not
be
secondary
,
but
a
primary
one
.

One
of
the
sit-in
leaders
has
said
:
``
Nobody
from
the
top
of
Heaven
to
the
bottom
of
Hell
can
stop
the
march
to
freedom
.

This
makes
necessary
a
morality
of
means
,
and
principles
governing
the
conduct
of
resistance
whenever
this
is
thought
to
be
justified
.

The
question
,
then
,
is
whether
sufficient
discrimination
in
the
use
of
even
non-violent
means
of
coercion
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
such
conduct
demoralizes
and
overcomes
the
opponent
while
re-moralizing
and
re-establishing
him
.

and
to
them
it
will
seem
insignificant
that
it
is
proposed
to
defeat
such
causes
non-violently
.

These
principles
we
have
now
set
forth
.

Both
the
conditions
and
the
complicity
are
documented
in
considerable
detail
.

They
have
also
led
the
nation
in
the
direction
of
a
welfare
state
.

And
both
in
their
objectives
of
non-discrimination
and
of
social
progress
they
have
had
ranged
against
them
the
Southerners
who
are
called
Bourbons
.

Yet
paradoxically
my
liberal
friends
continue
to
view
Jefferson
as
one
of
their
patron
saints
.

I
am
naive
,
they
say
,
to
make
use
of
such
words
.

--
liberal
considers
that
the
need
for
a
national
economy
with
controls
that
will
assure
his
conception
of
social
justice
is
so
great
that
individual
and
local
liberties
as
well
as
democratic
processes
may
have
to
yield
before
it
.

This
seems
like
an
attitude
favoring
a
sort
of
totalitarian
bureaucracy
which
,
under
a
President
of
the
same
stamp
,
would
try
to
coerce
an
uncooperative
Congress
or
Supreme
Court
.

His
assumption
seems
to
be
that
any
such
friends
,
being
tolerable
humans
,
must
be
more
liberal
than
most
Southerners
and
therefore
at
least
partly
in
sympathy
with
his
views
.

In
business
circles
,
usually
conservative
,
this
sort
of
atmosphere
would
hardly
be
found
.

From
my
wife's
experience
and
other
sources
,
this
seems
to
be
rarely
encountered
in
educated
circles
.

I
never
heard
of
a
poll
being
taken
on
the
question
.

but
many
historians
maintain
that
except
for
Northern
meddling
it
would
have
ended
in
states
like
Virginia
years
before
it
did
.

Southern
resentment
has
been
over
the
method
of
its
ending
,
the
invasion
,
and
Reconstruction
;
;

If
the
circumstances
are
faced
frankly
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
this
to
be
true
.

And
the
great
majority
of
these
people
are
of
Anglo-Saxon
or
Celtic
descent
.

And
there
is
no
section
of
the
nation
more
ardent
than
the
South
in
the
cold
war
against
Communism
.

It
is
extraordinary
that
a
people
as
proud
and
warlike
as
Southerners
should
have
been
as
docile
as
they
have
.

Most
of
them
sincerely
believe
that
the
Anglo-Saxon
is
the
best
race
in
the
world
and
that
it
should
remain
pure
.

But
those
among
the
Bourbons
who
remain
unreconstructed
go
much
further
than
this
.

The
South's
antipathy
to
Northern
civilization
includes
such
charges
as
poor
manners
,
harsh
accents
,
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
arts
of
living
like
gastronomy
and
the
use
of
leisure
.

By
prevailing
over
other
claimants
for
the
loyalties
of
men
,
the
nation-state
maintained
an
adequate
measure
of
certainty
and
order
within
its
territorial
borders
.

)

Beyond
the
two
basic
tasks
mentioned
above
,
no
attention
was
paid
by
statesman
or
scholar
to
an
idea
of
state
responsibility
,
either
internally
or
externally
.

This
was
particularly
true
in
the
world
arena
,
which
was
an
anarchical
battleground
characterized
by
strife
and
avaricious
competition
for
colonial
empires
.

His
duty
was
to
his
sovereign
and
to
his
nation
,
and
an
extension
to
peoples
beyond
the
territorial
boundaries
was
not
to
be
contemplated
.

Already
firmly
implanted
internally
,
it
is
a
growing
factor
in
external
matters
.

A
third
,
one
of
at
least
equal
and
perhaps
even
greater
importance
,
is
now
being
traversed
:
American
immersion
and
involvement
in
world
affairs
.

In
1961
the
first
important
legislative
victory
of
the
Kennedy
Administration
came
when
the
principle
of
national
responsibility
for
local
economic
distress
won
out
over
a
``
state's-responsibility
''
proposal
--
provision
was
made
for
payment
for
unemployment
relief
by
nation-wide
taxation
rather
than
by
a
levy
only
on
those
states
afflicted
with
manpower
surplus
.

The
American
people
have
indeed
come
a
long
way
in
the
brief
interval
between
1930
and
1961
.

Internal
national
responsibility
is
a
societal
response
to
the
impact
of
the
Industrial
Revolution
.

The
idea
of
national
responsibility
thus
has
become
a
common
feature
of
the
nations
of
the
non-Soviet
world
.

In
its
beginnings
the
nation-state
had
to
struggle
to
assert
itself
--
internally
,
against
feudal
groups
,
and
externally
,
against
the
power
and
influence
of
such
other
claimants
for
loyalty
as
the
Church
.

)
The
concept
of
nationalism
is
the
political
principle
that
epitomizes
and
glorifies
the
territorial
state
as
the
characteristic
type
of
socal
structure
.

By
subduing
disparate
lesser
groups
the
nation
has
,
to
some
degree
at
least
,
broadened
the
capacity
for
individual
liberty
.

Within
their
confines
,
moreover
,
technological
and
industrial
growth
has
proceeded
at
an
accelerated
pace
,
thus
increasing
the
cornucopia
from
which
material
wants
can
be
satisfied
.

The
former
receives
its
legitimacy
from
the
latter
.

While
sovereignty
has
roots
in
antiquity
,
in
its
present
usage
it
is
essentially
modern
.

What
steps
have
been
taken
to
guard
against
the
one
sort
of
mishap
that
could
trigger
the
destruction
of
continents
?
?

In
the
command
centers
there
are
special
clocks
ready
to
tick
off
the
minutes
elapsed
since
``
E
hour
''
.

There
is
little
time
for
the
men
in
the
command
centers
to
reflect
about
the
implications
of
these
clocks
.

Among
the
policy
makers
,
generals
,
physicists
,
psychologists
and
others
charged
with
controlling
the
actions
of
the
button
pushers
and
their
``
hardware
''
,
the
answers
to
my
questions
varied
partly
according
to
a
man's
flair
for
what
the
professionals
in
this
field
call
``
scenarios
''
.

Its
radar
screens
would
register
Soviet
missiles
shortly
after
they
are
launched
against
the
United
States
.

Alternate
locations
exist
for
all
key
command
centers
.

And
no
messages
can
be
transmitted
on
these
circuits
until
senders
and
receivers
authenticate
in
advance
,
by
special
codes
,
that
the
messages
actually
come
from
their
purported
sources
.

He
makes
the
momentous
decision
.

All
can
be
connected
with
the
gold
circuit
from
their
homes
.

Officers
who
participate
in
the
continual
practice
drills
assured
me
that
the
President's
decision
could
be
made
and
announced
on
the
gold
circuit
within
minutes
after
the
first
flash
from
Aj
.

Let
us
look
in
on
one
of
these
nerve
centers
--
SAC
at
Omaha
--
and
see
what
must
still
happen
before
a
wing
of
B-52
bombers
could
drop
their
Aj
.

He
or
his
deputy
or
one
of
their
seven
assistants
,
all
full
colonels
,
mans
the
heart
of
the
command
post
twenty-four
hours
a
day
.

Movable
panels
of
floor-to-ceiling
maps
and
charts
are
crammed
with
intelligence
information
.

No
question
ruffles
him
or
causes
him
to
hesitate
.

Wisman
,
below
,
would
listen
in
and
act
.

(
There
are
two
receivers
in
case
one
should
be
dropped
and
damaged
.

They
are
supplied
,
a
batch
at
a
time
,
by
a
secret
source
and
are
continually
changed
by
Wisman
or
his
staff
,
at
random
intervals
.

They
are
mere
fragments
,
just
one
portion
of
preprepared
messages
.

In
addition
to
the
authentication
and
acknowledgment
procedures
which
precede
and
follow
the
sending
of
the
go
messages
,
again
in
special
codes
,
each
message
also
contains
an
``
internal
authenticator
''
,
another
specific
signal
to
convince
the
recipient
that
he
is
getting
the
real
thing
.

I
asked
Wisman
what
would
happen
if
he
broke
out
the
go
codes
and
tried
to
start
transmitting
one
.

Unless
we
send
out
the
whole
pie
,
their
pieces
mean
nothing
''
.

At
any
rate
,
three
men
out
of
a
six-man
B-52
crew
are
required
to
copy
down
Wisman's
go-to-war
message
.

All
three
must
compare
notes
and
agree
to
``
go
''
.

They
saw
it
before
I
did
,
even
with
my
binoculars
.

A
white
man
would
not
have
seen
it
.

Sometimes
it
was
to
skirt
a
gulley
.

It
is
a
barely
controlled
skimming
of
the
ground
.

He
had
found
a
depression
with
rain
water
in
it
.

The
other
trotted
over
and
swooped
at
the
tiny
puddle
.

``

The
countryside
looked
like
a
beautiful
open
park
with
gentle
slopes
and
soft
gray
tree-clumps
.

They
lay
,
with
the
birds
hopping
from
branch
to
branch
above
them
and
the
bright
sky
peeping
down
at
them
.

And
countless
others
like
them
have
died
.

he
knows
that
the
land
is
hard
and
pitiless
.

He
knows
that
the
economy
of
life
in
the
``
outback
''
is
awful
.

Finally
,
however
,
the
arrangements
were
made
and
we
drove
out
into
the
bush
in
a
Land
Rover
.

The
sun
was
not
yet
high
and
all
of
them
were
in
the
small
area
of
shade
cast
by
the
boulder
.

It
struck
me
as
a
very
bright
and
very
malnourished
dog
.

His
legs
were
narrow
and
very
long
.

She
remained
squatting
on
her
heels
all
the
time
we
were
there
;
;

They
squatted
on
their
heels
with
their
heads
bent
far
forward
,
their
eyes
only
a
few
inches
from
the
ground
.

The
tiny
bodies
,
dropped
onto
a
dry
leaf
,
made
a
pile
as
big
as
a
small
apple
.

One's
impulse
is
to
say
that
the
smell
was
a
stink
and
unpleasant
.

as
if
the
coating
of
sweat
,
dirt
,
and
ashes
were
a
cosmetic
.

``
That
smell
is
something
,
eh
,
mate
''
?
?

The
stink
is
all
the
same
to
me
,
but
I
really
think
they
can
make
one
another
out
blindfolded
''
.

The
architects
,
the
tile
and
carpet
makers
,
the
potters
,
painters
,
calligraphers
,
and
metalsmiths
worked
through
Abbas's
reign
and
those
of
his
successors
to
enrich
the
city
.

The
Afghans
invaded
;
;

They
think
of
it
as
a
kind
of
spooky
museum
in
which
they
may
half
see
and
half
imagine
the
old
splendor
.

The
one
apparent
connection
between
the
two
is
a
score
of
buildings
which
somehow
or
other
have
survived
and
which
naturally
enough
are
called
``
historical
monuments
''
.

Often
,
too
,
the
social
institutions
are
housed
in
these
pavilions
and
palaces
and
bridges
,
for
these
great
structures
are
not
simply
``
historical
monuments
''
;
;

Those
three
other
great
activities
of
the
Persians
,
the
bath
,
the
teahouse
,
and
the
zur
khaneh
(
the
latter
a
kind
of
club
in
which
a
leader
and
a
group
of
men
in
an
octagonal
pit
move
through
a
rite
of
calisthenics
,
dance
,
chanted
poetry
,
and
music
)
,
do
not
take
place
in
buildings
to
which
entrance
tickets
are
sold
,
but
some
of
them
occupy
splendid
examples
of
Persian
domestic
architecture
:
long
,
domed
,
chalk-white
rooms
with
daises
of
turquoise
tile
,
their
end
walls
cut
through
to
the
orchards
and
the
sky
by
open
arches
.

Water
,
air
,
fruit
,
poetry
,
music
,
the
human
form
--
these
things
are
important
to
Persians
,
and
they
experience
them
with
an
intense
and
discriminating
awareness
.

I
really
didn't
know
what
he
meant
.

It
was
a
nice
day
,
granted
.

from
downstream
,
where
the
water
level
is
much
lower
,
it
is
a
high
,
elaborately
facaded
pavilion
.

On
the
downstream
,
or
``
pavilion
''
,
side
these
vaults
give
out
onto
terraces
twice
as
wide
as
the
bridge
itself
.

From
the
terraces
--
eighteen
in
all
--
broad
flights
of
steps
descend
into
the
water
or
onto
still
more
terraces
barely
above
the
level
of
the
river
.

Crowds
press
along
the
terraces
,
down
the
steps
,
in
and
out
of
the
arcades
,
massing
against
it
as
though
it
were
a
fortress
under
siege
.

dervishes
who
stand
with
the
stillness
of
the
blind
,
their
eyes
filmed
with
rheum
and
visions
;
;

Poetry
in
Persian
life
is
far
more
than
a
common
ground
on
which
--
in
a
society
deeply
fissured
by
antagonisms
--
all
may
stand
.

This
schedule
became
too
strenuous
,
even
for
the
energetic
and
conscientious
Mr.
Steinberg
.

As
we
began
to
converse
in
the
lounge
of
his
Fifth
Avenue
hotel
,
his
restlessness
and
sensitivity
to
light
and
sound
became
immediately
apparent
.

She
even
devised
a
system
of
colors
,
whereby
the
boy
could
easily
distinguish
the
different
note
values
.

The
musician
ran
away
from
school
when
he
was
fifteen
,
but
this
escapade
did
not
save
him
from
the
Gymnasium
.

He
had
presented
the
first
German
performances
of
Puccini's
Manon
Lescaut
and
De
Falla's
La
Vida
Breve
.

After
he
had
spent
the
first
three
years
in
New
York
as
associate
conductor
,
at
Toscanini's
invitation
,
of
the
NBC
Orchestra
,
he
made
numerous
guest
appearances
throughout
the
United
States
and
Latin
America
.

In
recent
years
he
has
traveled
widely
in
Europe
,
conducting
in
Italy
,
France
,
Austria
,
and
Switzerland
.

``
Then
I
return
to
the
United
States
for
engagements
at
the
Hollywood
Bowl
and
in
Philadelphia
''
,
he
added
.

There
will
be
premieres
of
new
works
,
made
possible
through
Ford
Foundation
commissions
:
Carlisle
Floyd's
Mystery
,
with
Phyllis
Curtin
as
soprano
soloist
.

My
Pittsburghers
have
become
real
addicts
to
Mahler
and
Bruckner
''
.

``
There
was
always
and
at
all
times
a
contemporary
music
and
it
expresses
the
era
in
which
it
was
created
.

He
had
just
paid
a
brief
visit
to
the
Frick
Collection
to
admire
his
favorite
paintings
by
Rembrandt
and
Franz
Hals
.

What
did
he
do
for
relaxation
?
?

He
cited
Heine
and
Stendhal
as
favorites
in
literature
.

But
his
prime
interest
,
apart
from
music
,
he
insisted
seriously
,
was
his
family
--
his
wife
,
daughter
and
son
.

``
Is
the
attitude
of
German
youth
comparable
to
that
of
``
the
angry
young
men
'
of
England
''
?
?

I
was
chairman
,
the
only
not
youthful
participant
.

I
was
far
from
convinced
of
the
truth
of
my
statement
,
but
could
not
think
of
anything
that
might
evoke
responses
more
quickly
.

No
one
wanted
a
larger
family
or
no
children
,
and
none
hoped
for
a
castle
or
said
that
living
in
less
settled
circumstances
would
be
satisfactory
.

It
is
well
then
that
in
this
hour
both
of
``
national
peril
''
and
of
``
national
opportunity
''
we
can
take
counsel
with
the
men
who
made
the
nation
.

Seven
Founders
--
George
Washington
,
Benjamin
Franklin
,
John
Adams
,
Thomas
Jefferson
,
Alexander
Hamilton
,
James
Madison
and
John
Jay
--
determined
the
destinies
of
the
new
nation
.

Strong
men
with
strong
opinions
,
frank
to
the
point
of
being
refreshingly
indiscreet
,
the
Founding
Seven
were
essentially
congenial
minds
,
and
their
agreements
with
each
other
were
more
consequential
than
their
differences
.

Before
merging
them
into
a
common
profile
it
is
well
to
remember
that
their
separate
careers
were
extraordinary
.

Author
of
the
Albany
Plan
Of
Union
,
which
,
had
it
been
adopted
,
might
have
avoided
the
Revolution
,
he
fought
the
colonists'
front-line
battles
in
London
,
negotiated
the
treaty
of
alliance
with
France
and
the
peace
that
ended
the
war
,
headed
the
state
government
of
Pennsylvania
,
and
exercised
an
important
moderating
influence
at
the
Federal
Convention
.

Retiring
to
his
beloved
Mount
Vernon
,
he
returned
to
preside
over
the
Federal
Convention
,
and
was
the
only
man
in
history
to
be
unanimously
elected
President
.

He
played
the
leading
role
in
negotiating
the
treaty
with
Great
Britain
that
ended
the
Revolution
,
and
directed
America's
foreign
affairs
throughout
the
Confederation
period
.

As
different
physically
as
the
tall
,
angular
Jefferson
was
from
the
chubby
,
rotund
Adams
,
the
seven
were
striking
individualists
.

Ardent
,
opinionated
,
even
obstinate
,
they
were
amazingly
articulate
,
wrote
their
own
copy
,
and
were
masters
of
phrasemaking
.

Capable
of
enduring
friendships
,
they
were
also
stout
controversialists
,
who
could
write
with
a
drop
of
vitriol
on
their
pens
.

He
served
as
Commander
in
Chief
during
the
Revolution
without
compensation
.

Hamilton
,
poorest
of
the
seven
,
gave
up
a
brilliant
law
practice
to
enter
Washington's
Cabinet
.

The
Frenchman
was
astonished
.

His
first
inaugural
address
speaks
of
``
my
country
whose
voice
I
can
never
hear
but
with
veneration
and
love
''
.

In
1900
the
South
was
only
15%
urban
;
;

Truman
Capote
is
still
reveling
in
Southern
Gothicism
,
exaggerating
the
old
Southern
legends
into
something
beautiful
and
grotesque
,
but
as
unreal
as
--
or
even
more
unreal
than
--
yesterday
.

Has
the
agrarian
tradition
become
such
an
addiction
that
the
switch
to
urbanism
is
somehow
dreaded
or
unwanted
?
?

Lacking
the
pioneer
spirit
necessary
to
write
of
a
new
economy
,
these
writers
seem
to
be
contenting
themselves
with
an
old
one
that
is
now
as
defunct
as
Confederate
money
.

Today's
evidence
,
such
as
the
fact
that
only
three
Southern
states
(
South
Carolina
,
Alabama
and
Mississippi
)
still
openly
defy
integration
,
would
have
astounded
many
of
yesterday's
Southerners
into
speechlessness
.

This
bold
self-assertion
,
after
decades
of
humble
subservience
,
is
indeed
a
twentieth-century
phenomenon
,
an
abrupt
change
in
the
Southern
way
of
existence
.

All
but
the
most
rabid
of
Confederate
flag
wavers
admit
that
the
Old
Southern
tradition
is
defunct
in
actuality
and
sigh
that
its
passing
was
accompanied
by
the
disappearance
of
many
genteel
and
aristocratic
traditions
of
the
reputedly
languid
ante-bellum
way
of
life
.

Perhaps
these
writers
have
been
too
deeply
moved
by
this
romanticizing
;
;

It
bewilders
and
befuddles
him
.

In
the
meantime
,
while
the
South
has
been
undergoing
this
phenomenal
modernization
that
is
so
disappointing
to
the
curious
Yankee
,
Southern
writers
have
certainly
done
little
to
reflect
and
promote
their
region's
progress
.

As
his
disciples
boast
,
even
though
his
emphasis
is
elsewhere
,
Faulkner
does
show
his
awareness
of
the
changing
order
of
the
South
quite
keenly
,
as
can
be
proven
by
a
quick
recalling
of
his
Sartoris
and
Snopes
families
.

The
thousands
of
city
migrants
who
desert
the
farms
yearly
must
readjust
with
even
greater
stress
and
tension
:
the
sacred
wilderness
is
gradually
surrendering
to
suburbs
and
research
parks
and
industrial
areas
.

Mr.
Nikolais
has
made
a
distinctive
contribution
to
the
arts
of
costume
and
decor
.

In
fact
,
he
calls
his
productions
dance-theatre
works
of
motion
,
shape
,
light
,
and
sound
.

To
raise
the
dancer
out
of
his
personal
,
pedestrian
self
,
Mr.
Nikolais
has
experimented
with
relating
him
to
a
larger
,
environmental
orbit
.

The
dancer
who
never
loosens
her
hold
on
a
parasol
,
begins
to
feel
that
it
is
part
of
herself
.

Or
,
clad
from
head
to
toe
in
fabric
stretched
over
a
series
of
hoops
,
the
performer
may
well
lose
his
sense
of
self
in
being
a
``
finial
''
.

Some
look
deliberately
to
devices
used
by
creators
in
the
other
arts
and
apply
corresponding
methods
to
their
own
work
.

The
unit
of
form
is
determined
subjectively
:
``
the
Heart
,
by
the
way
of
the
Breath
,
to
the
Line
''
.

He
may
even
alter
the
pattern
by
applying
a
scheme
of
random
numbers
.

Musicians
who
use
the
chance
method
also
exclude
subjective
control
of
formal
development
.

Again
,
the
composer
must
select
his
own
materials
.

According
to
Katherine
Litz
,
``
the
becoming
,
the
process
of
realization
,
is
the
dance
''
.

or
it
may
involve
more
subtle
distinctions
:
the
sway
may
be
gradually
minimized
or
enlarged
,
its
rhythmic
emphasis
may
be
slightly
modified
,
or
it
may
be
transferred
to
become
a
movement
of
only
the
arms
or
the
head
.

It
is
through
the
metamorphosed
dancer
that
the
germ
of
form
is
discovered
.

Though
he
is
also
concerned
with
freeing
dance
from
pedestrian
modes
of
activity
,
Merce
Cunningham
has
selected
a
very
different
method
for
achieving
his
aim
.

An
order
can
be
chanced
rather
than
chosen
,
and
this
approach
produces
an
experience
that
is
``
free
and
discovered
rather
than
bound
and
remembered
''
.

Chance
,
he
finds
,
enables
him
to
create
``
a
world
beyond
imagination
''
.

He
cites
with
pleasure
the
comment
of
a
lady
,
who
exclaimed
after
a
concert
:
``
Why
,
it's
extremely
interesting
.

nearby
,
another
sits
motionless
,
while
still
another
is
twirling
an
umbrella
.

He
lifts
her
,
puts
her
down
,
and
walks
off
,
neither
pleased
nor
disturbed
,
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.

And
any
sequence
can
not
only
change
its
positions
in
the
work
but
can
even
be
eliminated
from
it
altogether
.

Mr.
Cunningham
tries
not
to
cheat
the
chance
method
;
;

However
,
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
chance
will
make
demands
the
dancers
find
impossible
to
execute
.

The
present
issue
in
Atlantica
--
whether
to
transform
an
alliance
of
sovereign
nations
into
a
federal
union
of
sovereign
citizens
--
resembles
the
American
one
of
1787-89
rather
than
the
one
that
was
resolved
by
Civil
War
.

We
began
by
declaring
that
all
men
are
created
equal
.

When
the
Know-nothings
get
control
,
it
will
read
,
All
men
are
created
equal
except
Negroes
and
foreigners
and
Catholics
.

The
difference
between
confederacy
and
federal
union
in
1861

Their
President
,
Jefferson
Davis
,
interpreted
their
Constitution
to
mean
that
it
``
admits
of
no
coerced
association
''
,
but
this
remained
so
doubtful
that
``
there
were
frequent
demands
that
the
right
to
secede
be
put
into
the
Constitution
''
.

''
The
other
important
difference
between
the
two
Constitutions
was
that
the
President
of
the
Confederacy
held
office
for
six
(
instead
of
four
)
years
,
and
was
limited
to
one
term
.

Here
are
the
two
Preambles
:
Federal
Constitution
,
1789

Confederate
Constitution
,
1861

But
though
the
Southern
States
,
when
drafting
a
constitution
to
unite
themselves
,
narrowed
the
difference
to
this
fine
point
by
omitting
to
assert
the
right
to
secede
,
the
fact
remained
that
by
seceding
from
the
Union
they
had
already
acted
on
the
concept
that
it
was
composed
primarily
of
sovereign
states
.

Lincoln
saw
that
the
act
of
secession
made
the
issue
for
the
Union
a
vital
one
:
Whether
it
was
a
Union
of
sovereign
citizens
that
should
continue
to
live
,
or
an
association
of
sovereign
states
that
must
fall
prey
either
to
``
anarchy
or
despotism
''
.

Much
as
he
abhorred
slavery
,
Lincoln
was
always
willing
to
concede
to
each
``
slave
state
''
the
right
to
decide
independently
whether
to
continue
or
end
it
.

The
140,414
Americans
who
gave
``
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion
''
to
prevent
disunion
,
preserved
individual
freedom
in
the
United
States
from
the
dangers
of
anarchy
,
inherent
in
confederations
,
which
throughout
history
have
proved
fatal
in
the
end
to
all
associations
composed
primarily
of
sovereign
states
,
and
to
the
liberties
of
their
people
.

But
the
fact
that
70,524
other
Americans
gave
the
same
measure
of
devotion
to
an
opposing
concept
served
Liberty-and-Union
in
other
essential
ways
.

The
very
fact
that
they
came
so
near
to
winning
by
the
wrong
method
,
war
,
led
directly
to
their
losing
both
the
war
and
the
wrong
thing
they
fought
for
,
since
it
forced
Lincoln
to
free
their
slaves
as
a
military
measure
.

There
was
also
a
lesson
,
one
that
has
served
ever
since
to
keep
Americans
,
in
their
conflicts
with
one
another
,
from
turning
from
the
ballot
to
the
bullet
.

The
lives
so
many
of
them
gave
,
to
forestall
what
they
believed
would
be
a
fatal
encroachment
by
the
Union
on
the
powers
reserved
to
their
states
have
continued
ever
since
to
safeguard
all
Americans
against
freedom's
other
foe
.

The
useful
suggestion
of
Professor
David
Hawkins
which
considers
culture
as
a
third
stage
in
biological
evolution
fits
quite
beautifully
then
with
our
suggestion
that
science
has
provided
us
with
a
rather
successful
technique
for
building
protective
artificial
environments
.

And
it
is
certainly
no
slight
to
either
of
them
to
compare
both
their
achievements
and
their
impact
.

Political
theoretical
understanding
,
although
almost
at
a
standstill
during
this
century
,
did
develop
during
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
,
and
resulted
in
a
flood
of
inventions
which
increased
the
possibility
for
man
to
coexist
with
man
.

The
bombs
are
as
harmless
as
an
automobile
in
a
garage
.

To
say
that
science
had
reduced
many
such
fears
merely
reiterates
the
obvious
and
frequent
statement
that
science
eliminated
much
of
magic
and
superstition
.

Solar
activities
could
presumably
bring
long
periods
of
flood
or
drought
.

Yet
we
no
longer
feel
uneasy
.

This
almost
trivial
example
is
nevertheless
suggestive
,
for
there
are
some
elements
in
common
between
the
antique
fear
that
the
days
would
get
shorter
and
shorter
and
our
present
fear
of
war
.

We
perform
elaborate
international
exhortations
and
ceremonies
with
virtually
no
understanding
of
social
cause
and
effect
.

The
achievements
which
dispelled
our
fears
of
the
cosmos
took
place
three
centuries
ago
.

American
newspaper
reviewers
like
to
call
his
plays
nihilistic
.

They
find
deep
pessimism
in
them
.

Even
so
astute
a
commentator
as
Harold
Clurman
of
The
Nation
has
said
that
``
Waiting
For
Godot
''
is
``
the
concentrate
of
the
contemporary
European
mood
of
despair
''
.

They
look
as
if
they
had
been
sculptured
with
an
unsharpened
chisel
.

The
Irish
accent
is
,
as
one
would
expect
,
combined
with
slight
inflections
from
the
French
.

His
tweed
suit
was
a
baggy
gray
and
green
.

We
walked
down
the
Rue
De
L'Arcade
,
thence
along
beside
the
Madeleine
and
across
to
a
sidewalk
cafe
opposite
that
church
.

I
reconstruct
his
sentences
from
notes
made
immediately
after
our
conversation
.

To
swim
is
true
,
and
to
sink
is
true
.

Then
he
began
to
speak
about
the
tension
in
art
between
the
mess
and
form
.

Until
recently
,
art
has
withstood
the
pressure
of
chaotic
things
.

If
we
look
at
recent
art
we
find
it
preoccupied
with
form
.

The
form
and
the
chaos
remain
separate
.

The
classical
lines
of
the
church
which
Napoleon
thought
of
as
a
Temple
of
Glory
,
dominated
all
the
scene
where
we
sat
.

It
is
because
there
is
not
only
darkness
but
also
light
that
our
situation
becomes
inexplicable
.

The
destiny
of
Racine's
Phedre
is
sealed
from
the
beginning
:
she
will
proceed
into
the
dark
.

At
the
beginning
of
the
play
she
has
partial
illumination
and
at
the
end
she
has
complete
illumination
,
but
there
has
been
no
question
but
that
she
moves
toward
the
dark
.

The
question
would
also
be
removed
if
we
believed
in
the
contrary
--
total
salvation
.

But
where
we
have
both
dark
and
light
we
have
also
the
inexplicable
.

Once
I
had
a
religious
emotion
.

At
the
moment
of
crisis
it
had
no
more
depth
than
an
old
school
tie
.

One
day
the
dogs
of
Ireland
will
do
that
too
and
perhaps
also
the
pigs
''
.

``
Yes
,
for
they
deal
with
distress
.

At
a
party
an
English
intellectual
--
so-called
--
asked
me
why
I
write
always
about
distress
.

I
left
the
party
as
soon
as
possible
and
got
into
a
taxi
.

At
the
same
time
,
he
is
plainly
sympathetic
,
clearly
friendly
.

If
there
were
only
the
mess
,
all
would
be
clear
;
;

but
there
is
also
compassion
.

Man
is
not
confined
to
one
outlet
for
his
vital
energy
.

The
creative
urge
,
for
example
,
transcends
the
body
and
the
self
.

Nothing
is
more
revealing
of
the
way
of
life
and
literary
aspirations
of
this
group
than
their
attitude
toward
sex
.

For
the
beatnik
,
like
the
hipster
,
is
in
opposition
to
a
society
that
is
based
on
the
repression
of
the
sex
instinct
.

For
this
reason
,
too
,
their
language
is
more
forthright
and
earthy
.

It
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
they
resist
the
lure
of
marriage
and
the
trap
of
domesticity
,
for
like
cats
they
are
determined
not
to
tame
their
sexual
energy
.

As
Lipton
,
the
prophet
of
the
beat
generation
,
declares
:
``
In
the
sexual
act
,
the
beat
are
filled
with
mana
,
the
divine
power
.

This
is
far
from
the
vulgar
,
leering
sexuality
of
the
middle-class
square
in
heat
''
.

If
Wilhelm
Reich
is
the
Moses
who
has
led
them
out
of
the
Egypt
of
sexual
slavery
,
Dylan
Thomas
is
the
poet
who
offers
them
the
Dionysian
dialectic
of
justification
for
their
indulgence
in
liquor
,
marijuana
,
sex
,
and
jazz
.

Thus
,
paradoxically
,
the
beat
writers
resort
to
``
religious
''
metaphors
:
they
are
in
search
of
mana
,
the
spiritual
,
the
numinous
,
but
not
anything
connected
with
formal
religion
.

Jazz
,
like
sex
,
is
a
mystique
.

they
will
destroy
the
shrines
,
temples
,
museums
,
and
churches
of
the
state
that
is
the
implacable
enemy
of
the
life
they
believe
in
.

they
will
trust
only
their
physical
sensations
,
the
wisdom
of
the
body
,
the
holy
promptings
of
the
unconscious
.

Their
rebellion
against
authoritarian
society
is
not
far
removed
from
the
violence
of
revolt
characteristic
of
the
juvenile
delinquent
.

This
girl
soon
drops
the
bourgeois
pyschiatrist
who
disapproves
of
her
life
.

This
confession
serves
to
make
clear
in
part
what
is
behind
this
sexual
revolution
:
the
craving
for
sensation
for
its
own
sake
,
the
need
for
change
,
for
new
experiences
.

Boredom
is
death
.

The
professed
mission
of
this
disaffiliated
generation
is
to
find
a
new
way
of
life
which
they
can
express
in
poetry
and
fiction
,
but
what
they
produce
is
unfortunately
disordered
,
nourished
solely
on
the
hysteria
of
negation
.

Who
are
the
creative
representatives
of
this
movement
?
?

Their
previous
legalized
marriages
do
not
count
,
for
they
hold
the
laws
of
the
state
null
and
void
.

This
is
the
rhetoric
of
righteousness
the
beatniks
use
in
defending
their
way
of
life
,
their
search
for
wholeness
,
though
their
actual
existence
fails
to
reach
these
``
religious
''
heights
.

What
obsessions
had
she
picked
up
during
these
long
nights
of
talk
?
?

Sex
as
the
creative
principle
of
the
universe
,
the
secret
of
primitive
religion
,
the
life
of
myth
.

No
one
asks
questions
about
the
free
union
of
the
sexes
in
West
Venice
so
long
as
the
partners
share
the
negative
attitudes
of
the
group
.

Carried
high
on
this
``
charge
''
,
he
composes
``
magical
''
poetry
that
captures
the
organic
rhythms
of
life
in
words
.

For
drugs
are
in
themselves
no
royal
road
to
creativity
.

Alley
fences
were
made
of
solid
boards
higher
than
one's
head
,
but
not
so
high
as
the
golden
glow
in
a
corner
or
the
hollyhocks
that
grew
in
a
line
against
them
.

they
were
topped
by
steeples
complete
in
every
detail
:
high-pitched
roof
,
pinnacle
,
and
narrow
gable
.

The
primary
quality
of
that
view
seems
,
now
,
to
have
been
its
quietness
,
but
that
cannot
at
the
time
have
impressed
us
.

Time
is
a
queer
thing
and
memory
a
queerer
;
;

In
a
stream
that
turns
a
mill-wheel
there
is
a
lot
of
water
;
;

she
filled
the
waste
spots
of
the
yard
with
common
things
like
the
garden
heliotrope
in
a
corner
by
the
woodshed
,
and
the
plantain
lilies
along
the
west
side
of
the
house
.

Other
flowers
we
might
gather
as
we
pleased
:
myrtle
and
white
violets
from
beneath
the
lilacs
;
;

the
lilacs
themselves
,
that
bloomed
so
prodigally
but
for
the
most
part
beyond
our
reach
;
;

hollyhock
blossoms
that
,
turned
upside
down
,
make
pink-petticoated
ladies
;
;

Pale
yellow
snapdragons
that
by
pinching
could
be
made
to
bite
;
;

Fuzzy
caterpillars
,
snails
with
their
sensitive
horns
,
struggling
grasshoppers
held
by
their
long
hind
legs
and
commanded
to
``
spit
tobacco
,
spit
''
.

In
the
heat
of
the
summer
,
the
garden
solitudes
were
ours
alone
;
;

our
elders
stayed
in
the
dark
house
or
sat
fanning
on
the
front
porch
.

Every
slight
sound
that
rose
against
that
pressure
fell
away
again
,
crushed
beneath
it
.

The
lazy
sing-song
was
spaced
in
time
like
the
drone
of
a
bumble-bee
.

the
trees'
shadows
circled
from
street
to
sidewalk
,
from
sidewalk
to
lawn
.

Opposite
every
gate
was
a
hitching
post
or
a
stone
carriage-step
,
set
with
a
rusty
iron
ring
for
tying
a
horse
.

it
was
mud
in
wet
weather
and
dust
,
ankle-deep
,
in
dry
,
and
could
be
crossed
only
at
the
corner
where
there
were
stepping
stones
.

The
hoofmarks
of
cattle
and
the
prints
of
bare
feet
in
the
mud
or
in
the
dust
were
as
numerous
as
the
traces
of
shod
horses
.

The
wife
,
Amra
,
and
her
lover
are
both
savagely
portrayed
,
she
as
incarnate
sensuality
,
``
voluptuous
''
and
``
indolent
''
,
possibly
``
a
mischief
maker
''
,
with
``
a
kind
of
luxurious
cunning
''
to
set
against
her
apparent
simplicity
,
her
``
birdlike
brain
''
.

it
is
a
spectacle
absolutely
painful
,
an
epiphany
of
the
suffering
flesh
unredeemed
by
spirit
,
untouched
by
any
spirit
other
than
abasement
and
humiliation
.

The
music
which
Lautner
has
composed
for
this
episode
is
for
the
most
part
``
rather
pretty
and
perfectly
banal
''
.

But
it
is
characteristic
of
him
,
we
are
told
,
``
his
little
artifice
''
,
to
be
able
to
introduce
``
into
a
fairly
vulgar
and
humorous
piece
of
hackwork
a
sudden
phrase
of
genuine
creative
art
''
.

And
this
occurs
now
,
at
the
refrain
of
Jacoby's
song
--
at
the
point
,
in
fact
,
of
the
name
``
Lizzy
''
--
;
;

a
modulation
described
as
``
almost
a
stroke
of
genius
''
.

he
collapses
,
and
dies
.

The
dramatic
construction
of
his
stories
characteristically
turns
on
a
situation
in
which
someone
is
simultaneously
compelled
and
forbidden
to
love
.

The
release
,
the
freedom
,
involved
in
loving
another
is
either
terribly
difficult
or
else
absolutely
impossible
;
;

This
prohibition
on
love
has
an
especially
poignant
relation
to
art
;
;

Professionally
a
lawyer
,
that
is
to
say
associated
with
dignity
,
reserve
,
discipline
,
with
much
that
is
essentially
middle-class
,
he
is
compelled
by
an
impossible
love
to
exhibit
himself
dressed
up
,
disguised
--
that
is
,
paradoxically
,
revealed
--
as
a
child
,
and
,
worse
,
as
a
whore
masquerading
as
a
child
.

Something
of
this
can
be
learned
from
``
The
Way
To
The
Churchyard
''
(
1901
)
,
an
anecdote
about
an
old
failure
whose
fit
of
anger
at
a
passing
cyclist
causes
him
to
die
of
a
stroke
or
seizure
.

There
is
no
more
``
plot
''
than
that
;
;

The
first
sentence
,
with
its
platitudinous
irony
,
announces
an
emblematic
intent
:
``
The
way
to
the
churchyard
ran
along
beside
the
highroad
,
ran
beside
it
all
the
way
to
the
end
;
;

And
the
action
is
consistently
presented
with
regard
for
this
distinction
.

The
highroad
,
one
might
say
at
first
,
belongs
to
life
,
while
the
way
to
the
churchyard
belongs
to
death
.

As
the
first
sentence
suggests
,
both
roads
belong
to
death
in
the
end
.

But
the
highroad
,
according
to
the
description
of
its
traffic
,
belongs
to
life
as
it
is
lived
in
unawareness
of
death
,
while
the
way
to
the
churchyard
belongs
to
some
other
sort
of
life
:
a
suffering
form
,
an
existence
wholly
comprised
in
the
awareness
of
death
.

His
name
is
Praisegod
Piepsam
,
and
he
is
rather
fully
described
as
to
his
clothing
and
physiognomy
in
a
way
which
relates
him
to
a
sinister
type
in
the
author's
repertory
--
he
is
a
forerunner
of
those
enigmatic
strangers
in
``
Death
In
Venice
''
,
for
example
,
who
represent
some
combination
of
cadaver
,
exotic
,
and
psychopomp
.

This
strange
person
quarrels
with
a
cyclist
because
the
latter
is
using
the
path
rather
than
the
highroad
.

The
cyclist
,
a
sufficiently
commonplace
young
fellow
,
is
not
named
but
identified
simply
as
``
Life
''
--
that
and
a
license
number
,
which
Piepsam
uses
in
addressing
him
.

Life
is
further
characterized
,
in
antithesis
to
Piepsam
,
as
animal
:
the
image
of
a
dog
,
which
appears
at
several
places
,
is
first
given
as
the
criterion
of
amiable
,
irrelevant
interest
aroused
by
life
considered
simply
as
a
spectacle
:
a
dog
in
a
wagon
is
``
admirable
''
,
``
a
pleasure
to
contemplate
''
;
;

his
end
is
ridiculous
and
trivial
.

He
is
``
a
man
raving
mad
on
the
way
to
the
churchyard
''
.

It
resembles
,
too
,
pictures
such
as
Durer
and
Bruegel
did
,
in
which
all
that
looks
at
first
to
be
solely
pictorial
proves
on
inspection
to
be
also
literary
,
the
representation
of
a
proverb
,
for
example
,
or
a
deadly
sin
.

in
particular
against
a
Madonna
portrayed
in
a
voluptuous
style
and
modeled
,
according
to
gossip
,
upon
the
painter's
mistress
.

On
the
street
outside
,
Hieronymus
envisions
a
holocaust
of
the
vanities
of
this
world
,
such
a
burning
of
artistic
and
erotic
productions
as
his
namesake
actually
brought
to
pass
in
Florence
,
and
prophetically
he
issues
his
curse
:
``
Gladius
Dei
super
terram
cito
et
velociter
''
.

The
person
of
the
artist
becomes
a
final
bastion
of
meaning
in
a
world
rendered
meaningless
by
the
march
of
events
and
the
decay
of
classical
religious
and
philosophical
systems
.

The
word
``
mimesis
''
(
``
imitation
''
)
is
usually
associated
with
Plato
and
Aristotle
.

All
artistic
and
mythological
representations
,
therefore
,
are
``
imitations
of
imitations
''
and
are
completely
superseded
by
the
truth
value
of
``
dialectic
''
,
the
proper
use
of
the
inquiring
intellect
.

In
the
first
instance
,
``
mimesis
''
is
here
used
to
mean
the
recalling
of
experience
in
terms
of
vivid
images
rather
than
in
terms
of
abstract
ideas
or
conventional
designations
.

By
``
image
''
is
meant
not
only
a
visual
presentation
,
but
also
remembered
sensations
of
any
of
the
five
senses
plus
the
feelings
which
are
immediately
conjoined
therewith
.

Mimesis
is
the
nearest
possible
thing
to
the
actual
re-living
of
experience
,
in
which
the
imagining
person
recovers
through
images
something
of
the
force
and
depth
characteristic
of
experience
itself
.

they
are
fields
of
force
exerting
a
unique
influence
on
the
sensibilities
and
a
unique
relatedness
to
one
another
.

A
word
taken
in
its
dictionary
meaning
,
a
photographic
image
of
a
recognizable
object
,
the
mere
picturing
of
a
``
scene
''
tends
to
lose
experiential
vividness
and
to
connote
such
conventional
abstractions
as
to
invite
neutral
reception
without
the
incitement
of
value
feelings
.

When
words
can
be
used
in
a
more
fresh
and
primitive
way
so
that
they
strike
with
the
force
of
sights
and
sounds
,
when
tones
of
sound
and
colors
of
paint
and
the
carven
shape
all
strike
the
sensibilities
with
an
undeniable
force
of
data
in
and
of
themselves
,
compelling
the
observer
into
an
attitude
of
attention
,
all
this
imitates
the
way
experience
itself
in
its
deepest
character
strikes
upon
the
door
of
consciousness
and
clamors
for
entrance
.

Experience
is
not
seen
,
as
it
is
in
classical
rationalism
,
as
presenting
us
initially
with
clear
and
distinct
objects
simply
located
in
space
and
registering
their
character
,
movements
,
and
changes
on
the
tabula
rasa
of
an
uninvolved
intellect
.

In
its
place
is
a
passionate
consciousness
grasped
and
molded
to
feelings
of
positive
or
negative
values
even
as
the
actions
of
one's
life
are
determined
by
constellations
of
process
in
which
one
is
caught
.

The
principal
defender
of
this
view
of
primary
experience
as
``
causal
efficacy
''
is
Alfred
North
Whitehead
.

A
chief
characteristic
of
experience
in
the
mode
of
causal
efficacy
is
one
of
derivation
from
the
past
.

In
town
after
town
my
companion
pointed
out
the
Negro
school
and
the
White
school
,
and
in
every
instance
the
former
made
a
better
appearance
(
it
was
newer
,
for
one
thing
)
.

It's
infuriating
,
this
feeling
that
one
is
being
picked
on
,
continually
,
constantly
.

By
what
right
of
superior
virtue
,
Southerners
ask
,
do
the
people
of
the
North
do
this
?
?

Moreover
,
the
law
of
the
land
is
not
irrevocable
;
;

Mr.
Justice
Taney's
Dred
Scott
decision
in
1857
was
unpopular
in
the
North
,
and
soon
became
a
dead
letter
.

Prohibition
was
the
law
of
the
land
,
but
it
was
unpopular
(
how
many
of
us
oldsters
took
up
drinking
in
prohibition
days
,
drinking
was
so
gay
,
so
fashionable
,
especially
in
the
sophisticated
Northeast
!
!

The
cliche
loses
its
talismanic
virtue
in
the
light
of
a
little
history
.

Is
the
consent
of
the
governed
a
numerical
majority
?
?

That
the
Court
order
does
not
unequally
affect
the
Southern
region
?
?

Southern
Liberals
(
there
are
a
good
many
)
--
especially
if
they're
rich
--
often
exhibit
blithe
insouciance
.

A
recent
newspaper
report
said
there
were
five
Negroes
in
the
1960
graduating
class
of
nearly
one
thousand
at
Yale
;
;

I
must
confess
that
I
prefer
the
Liberal
who
is
personally
affected
,
who
is
willing
to
send
his
own
children
to
a
mixed
school
as
proof
of
his
faith
.

Who
is
involved
willy
nilly
?
?

And
one
finds
it
again
in
Thomas
Nelson
Page
)
to
the
effect
that
the
Mayflower
on
its
second
voyage
brought
a
cargo
of
Negro
slaves
.

It
is
something
which
most
of
us
try
to
get
out
from
under
.

Like
the
cowboy
in
Stephen
Crane's
``
Blue
Hotel
''
,
we
run
around
crying
,
``
Well
,
I
didn't
do
anything
,
did
I
''
?
?

Lincoln
was
historian
and
economist
enough
to
know
that
a
substantial
portion
of
this
wealth
had
accumulated
in
the
hands
of
the
descendants
of
New
Englanders
engaged
in
the
slave
trade
.

But
that
was
a
long
time
ago
.

There
one
finds
concentrated
in
a
comparatively
small
area
the
chief
universities
,
colleges
,
and
preparatory
schools
of
the
United
States
.

It
is
true
that
New
England
,
more
than
any
other
section
,
was
dedicated
to
education
from
the
start
.

Isn't
it
a
bit
odd
that
the
three
states
of
Southern
New
England
(
Massachusetts
,
Connecticut
,
and
Rhode
Island
)
have
had
state
institutions
of
university
status
only
in
the
very
recent
past
,
these
institutions
having
previously
been
A
&
M
colleges
?
?

Was
it
supposed
,
perchance
,
that
A
&
M
(
vocational
training
,
that
is
)
was
quite
sufficient
for
the
immigrant
class
which
flooded
that
part
of
the
New
England
world
in
the
post-Civil
War
period
,
the
immigrants
having
been
brought
in
from
Southern
Europe
,
to
work
in
the
mills
,
to
make
up
for
the
labor
shortage
caused
by
migration
to
the
West
?
?

A
Yale
historian
,
writing
a
few
years
ago
in
The
Yale
Review
,
said
:
``
We
in
New
England
have
long
since
segregated
our
children
''
.

One
is
that
they
were
established
,
or
gained
eminence
,
under
pressure
provided
by
these
same
immigrants
,
from
whom
the
old
families
wished
to
segregate
their
children
.

Equally
a
master
of
prose
and
verse
,
he
recreates
the
glory
of
Sweden
in
the
past
and
continues
it
into
the
present
.

On
his
father's
side
he
was
of
German
descent
,
on
his
mother's
he
came
of
the
old
Swedish
nobility
.

As
a
boy
in
a
local
school
he
was
shy
and
solitary
,
absorbed
in
his
fondness
for
nature
and
his
visions
of
Sweden's
ancient
glory
.

In
one
of
his
summers
at
home
he
married
,
to
the
great
disapproval
of
his
father
,
who
objected
because
of
his
extreme
youth
.

Deciding
to
become
a
painter
,
he
entered
the
studio
of
Gerome
in
Paris
,
where
he
enjoyed
the
life
of
the
artists
,
but
soon
found
that
whatever
talent
he
might
have
did
not
lie
in
that
direction
.

He
gives
us
an
account
of
this
in
his
lively
and
humorous
poem
,
``
The
Happy
Artists
''
.

It
may
,
however
,
be
noted
that
his
gift
for
color
and
imagery
must
have
been
greatly
stimulated
by
his
stay
in
Paris
.

Professor
Fredrik
Book
,
Sweden's
foremost
critic
of
the
period
,
acclaims
it
as
follows
:
``
In
this
we
have
the
verse
of
a
painter
;
;

strongly
colorful
,
plastic
,
racy
,
vivid
.

It
celebrates
the
unknown
architect
who
designed
the
temple
of
Neptune
at
Paestum
,
next
to
the
Parthenon
the
noblest
example
of
Grecian
classic
style
now
in
existence
.

The
supreme
object
of
their
lives
is
now
fulfilled
,
says
the
wife
,
her
husband
has
achieved
immortality
.

A
dominant
motive
is
the
poet's
longing
for
his
homeland
and
its
boyhood
associations
:
``
Not
men-folk
,
but
the
fields
where
I
would
stray
,
The
stones
where
as
a
child
I
used
to
play
''
.

His
next
major
work
,
completed
in
1892
,
was
a
long
fantastic
epic
in
prose
,
entitled
Hans
Alienus
,
which
Professor
Book
describes
as
a
monument
on
the
grave
of
his
carefree
and
indolent
youth
.

By
the
death
of
his
father
in
1888
he
had
come
into
possession
of
the
family
estate
and
had
re-assumed
its
traditions
.

The
general
effect
is
tragic
.

Of
few
authors
is
this
more
true
than
of
Heidenstam
.

The
Charles
Men
has
a
tremendous
range
of
characters
,
of
common
folk
even
more
than
of
major
figures
.

The
first
half
of
The
Charles
Men
,
ending
on
the
climax
of
the
battle
of
Poltava
in
1709
,
is
more
dramatically
coherent
than
the
second
.

Like
Napoleon
,
he
was
the
worst
of
losers
.

There
are
,
however
,
some
wonderful
chapters
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
part
,
concerning
the
reactions
of
the
Swedes
in
adversity
.

Then
more
than
ever
before
did
they
show
their
fortitude
and
patient
cheerfulness
.

This
comes
out
in
``
When
The
Bells
Ring
''
,
which
describes
the
rallying
of
the
peasants
in
southern
Sweden
to
repel
an
invasion
by
the
Danes
.

All
his
people
ask
for
is
no
more
war
.

Heidenstam
wrote
four
other
works
of
fiction
about
earlier
figures
revered
in
Swedish
memory
.

Admirably
written
,
it
is
a
perfect
introduction
to
Swedish
history
for
readers
of
other
countries
.

The
mythological
private
eye
differs
from
his
counterpart
in
real
life
in
two
essential
ways
.

For
this
reason
,
he
appears
as
an
independent
and
self-reliant
figure
,
whose
rugged
individualism
need
not
be
pressed
into
the
mold
of
a
9
to
5
routine
.

Whatever
his
original
assignment
,
the
fictional
private
eye
ends
up
by
investigating
and
solving
a
crime
,
usually
a
murder
.

Operating
as
a
one
man
police
force
in
fact
if
not
in
name
,
he
is
at
once
more
independent
and
more
dedicated
than
the
police
themselves
.

Thus
the
fictional
detective
is
much
more
than
a
simple
businessman
.

At
the
same
time
,
because
the
personal
code
of
the
detective
coincides
with
the
legal
dictates
of
his
society
,
because
he
likes
to
catch
criminals
,
he
is
in
middle
class
eyes
a
virtuous
man
.

he
is
a
public
servant
but
not
a
cop
.

A
brief
list
of
the
great
detective's
little
idiosyncrasies
would
provide
Dr.
Freud
with
ample
food
for
thought
.

His
eccentricity
begins
as
a
defense
against
boredom
.

These
little
problems
help
me
to
do
so
''
.

Why
do
the
police
find
Holmes
``
unorthodox
''
?
?

Another
,
more
interesting
explanation
,
is
hinted
at
by
Watson
when
he
observes
on
several
occasions
that
Holmes
would
have
made
a
magnificent
criminal
.

Their
dedication
to
the
status
quo
has
been
affirmed
at
the
expense
of
the
fascinating
but
dangerous
individualism
of
a
Sherlock
Holmes
.

they
fled
from
the
Victorian
parlor
and
made
their
way
across
the
stormy
Atlantic
.

With
Rex
Stout's
Nero
Wolfe
,
alienation
is
represented
on
a
purely
physical
plane
.

In
a
society
where
everything
is
for
sale
,
Marlowe
is
the
only
man
who
cannot
be
bought
.

His
tough
honesty
condemns
him
to
a
solitary
and
difficult
existence
.

A
similar
tone
of
underlying
futility
and
despair
pervades
the
spy
thrillers
of
Eric
Ambler
and
dominates
the
most
famous
of
all
American
mystery
stories
,
Dashiell
Hammett's
The
Maltese
Falcon
.

Now
the
detective
must
save
his
own
skin
by
informing
on
the
girl
he
loves
,
who
is
also
the
real
murderer
.

Because
the
private
eye
intends
to
save
society
in
spite
of
himself
,
he
invariably
finds
himself
in
trouble
with
the
police
.

The
latter
are
either
too
stupid
to
catch
the
killer
or
too
corrupt
to
care
.

Frequently
enough
,
the
police
are
themselves
in
league
with
the
killer
;
;

In
order
to
exonerate
himself
,
he
is
compelled
to
find
the
real
criminal
,
who
happens
to
be
his
girl
friend
.

It
is
the
growing
contradiction
between
individualism
and
public
service
in
the
mystery
story
which
creates
this
fatal
dilemma
.

By
upholding
his
own
personal
code
of
behavior
,
the
private
detective
has
placed
himself
in
opposition
to
a
society
whose
fabric
is
permeated
with
crime
and
corruption
.

That
society
responds
by
condemning
the
private
eye
as
a
threat
to
the
status
quo
,
a
potential
criminal
.

At
first
glance
,
this
hero
seems
to
be
more
rather
than
less
of
an
individualist
than
any
of
his
predecessors
.

For
Hammer
,
nothing
is
forbidden
.

It
will
be
shown
that
the
objectives
of
the
cooperative
people
in
an
organization
determine
the
type
of
network
required
,
because
the
type
of
network
functions
according
to
the
characteristics
of
the
messages
enumerated
in
Table
1
.

By
monitoring
,
we
mean
some
system
of
control
over
the
types
of
information
sent
from
the
various
centers
.

the
cocktail
party
.

The
party
is
usually
in
a
room
small
enough
so
that
all
guests
are
within
sight
and
hearing
of
one
another
.

Looking
at
the
diagram
,
we
see
that
Af
connection
lines
come
in
to
each
member
.

Thus
the
cocktail
party
would
appear
to
be
the
ideal
system
,
but
there
is
one
weakness
.

In
Figure
2
,
the
points
in
the
network
are
designated
by
a
letter
accompanied
by
a
number
.

Location
theorists
have
given
these
matters
much
consideration
.

Military
organizations
.

As
time
has
passed
and
science
has
progressed
,
the
speed
of
military
vehicles
has
increased
,
the
range
of
missiles
has
been
extended
,
the
use
of
target-hunting
noses
on
the
projectiles
has
been
adopted
,
and
the
range
and
breadth
of
message
sending
has
increased
.

Next
to
the
old
problem
of
the
slowness
of
decision
making
,
network
structure
seems
to
be
paramount
,
and
without
monitoring
no
network
has
value
.

The
monitoring
is
the
highest
and
most
restrictive
of
any
organization
in
existence
.

All
orders
originate
with
the
officer
of
highest
rank
and
terminate
with
action
of
the
men
in
the
ranks
.

With
troops
dispersed
on
fields
of
battle
rather
than
on
the
parade
ground
,
it
may
seem
that
a
certain
amount
of
monitoring
is
automatically
enforced
by
the
lines
of
communication
.

A
military
organization
has
an
objective
chosen
by
the
higher
command
.

(
B
)
A
message
runs
too
great
a
risk
of
being
distorted
if
it
is
to
be
relayed
more
than
about
six
consecutive
times
.

This
organizational
network
would
be
of
no
avail
if
there
were
no
regulations
pertaining
to
the
types
of
message
sent
.

Questions
and
,
particularly
,
exclamations
are
usually
channeled
along
informal
,
horizontal
lines
not
indicated
in
Figure
3
and
seldom
are
carried
beyond
the
nearest
neighbor
.

It
will
readily
be
seen
that
in
this
suggested
network
(
not
materially
different
from
some
of
the
networks
in
vogue
today
)
greater
emphasis
on
monitoring
is
implied
than
is
usually
put
into
practice
.

Since
the
difficulty
of
drawing
the
net
is
great
,
we
will
merely
discuss
it
.

For
example
,
there
are
persons
who
are
in
physical
science
,
in
the
field
of
mineralogy
,
trained
in
crystallography
,
who
use
only
X-rays
,
applying
only
the
powder
technique
of
X-ray
diffraction
,
to
clay
minerals
only
,
and
who
have
spent
the
last
fifteen
years
concentrating
on
the
montmorillonites
;
;

But
first
I
want
to
quote
him
on
the
relationship
that
he
found
between
religion
and
politics
in
this
country
and
what
happened
to
it
.

French
Egalitarianism
had
had
only
nominal
influence
in
this
country
before
the
days
of
Popularism
.

The
first
of
which
to
find
important
place
in
our
federal
government
was
the
graduated
income
tax
under
Wilson
.

Yet
,
after
Rousseau
had
given
the
social
contract
a
new
twist
with
his
notion
of
the
General
Will
,
the
same
philosophy
,
it
may
be
said
,
became
the
idea
source
of
the
French
Revolution
also
.

But
I
have
been
at
some
pains
to
review
it
as
the
drama
of
the
common
man
,
to
point
up
what
happened
to
him
under
Eisenhower's
leadership
.

The
show
was
colorful
,
indeed
,
exuberant
,
but
the
press
for
all
its
assiduity
could
detect
no
note
of
a
fateful
rendezvous
with
destiny
.

It
has
moved
on
various
levels
,
it
has
been
clamorous
and
confused
.

For
it
was
neglected
,
not
to
say
nascent
,
when
the
struggle
began
.

I
saw
a
piece
the
other
day
assailing
William
Buckley
,
author
of
Man
And
God
at
Yale
and
publisher
of
The
National
Review
,
as
no
conservative
at
all
,
but
an
old
liberal
.

What
I
am
here
to
do
is
to
report
on
the
gyrations
of
the
struggle
--
a
struggle
that
amounts
to
self-redefinition
--
to
see
if
we
can
predict
its
future
course
.

One
of
the
obvious
conclusions
we
can
make
on
the
basis
of
the
last
election
,
I
suppose
,
is
that
we
,
the
majority
,
were
dissatisfied
with
Eisenhower
conservatism
.

What
I
want
to
point
out
here
is
that
all
of
them
are
ex-liberals
,
or
modified
liberals
,
with
perhaps
one
exception
.

And
I
would
further
note
that
they
all
--
with
one
exception
again
--
sang
in
one
key
or
another
the
same
song
.

The
second
specific
comment
was
the
report
of
Eisenhower's
Commission
on
National
Goals
,
titled
Goals
For
Americans
.

This
group
is
secularist
and
their
program
tends
to
be
technological
.

And
let
me
add
Murray's
new
book
as
another
symptom
of
it
,
particularly
so
in
view
of
the
attention
Time
magazine
gave
it
when
it
came
out
recently
.

Father
Murray
goes
back
to
the
Declaration
of
Independence
,
too
,
though
I
may
add
,
with
considerably
more
historical
perception
.

Does
our
society
have
a
runaway
,
uncontrollable
growth
of
technology
which
may
end
our
civilization
,
or
a
normal
,
healthy
growth
?
?

Should
the
accelerating
growth
of
technology
then
warn
us
?
?

Noting
such
evidence
is
the
first
step
;
;

In
any
event
,
whether
society
may
have
cancer
,
or
merely
a
virus
infection
,
the
``
disease
''
,
we
shall
find
,
is
political
,
economical
,
social
,
and
even
medical
.

Asked
which
institution
most
needs
correction
,
I
would
say
the
corporation
as
it
exists
in
America
today
.

At
first
glance
this
appears
strange
:
of
all
people
,
was
not
America
founded
by
rugged
individualists
who
established
a
new
way
of
life
still
inspiring
``
undeveloped
''
societies
abroad
?
?

corporations
now
outmoded

Perhaps
the
public's
present
attitude
toward
business
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
``
rugged
capitalist
entrepreneur
''
no
more
exists
in
America
.

First
,
let
us
realize
that
whatever
good
this
set-up
achieved
in
earlier
times
,
now
the
corporation
per
se
cannot
take
economic
leadership
.

The
corporation
has
a
limited
,
specific
place
in
our
society
.

Ideally
speaking
,
it
should
be
allowed
to
operate
only
where
the
public
has
a
great
stake
in
the
continuity
of
supply
or
services
,
and
where
the
actions
of
a
single
proprietor
are
secondary
to
the
needs
of
society
.

In
all
other
areas
,
private
initiative
of
the
``
proprietorship
''
type
should
be
urged
to
produce
the
desired
goods
and
services
.

Corporations
react
violently
to
short-range
stimuli
,
e.g.
,
quarterly
and
annual
dividend
reports
.

Corporations
are
apt
by
nature
to
be
impersonal
,
inhumane
,
shortsighted
and
almost
exclusively
profit-motivated
,
a
picture
they
could
scarcely
afford
to
present
to
the
public
.

The
proprietor
is
able
to
create
a
leadership
impossible
in
the
corporate
structure
with
its
board
of
directors
and
stockholders
.

Men
continuously
at
the
head
of
growing
enterprises
can
acquire
experiences
of
the
most
varied
,
complicated
and
trying
type
so
that
at
maturation
they
have
developed
the
competence
and
willingness
to
accept
the
personal
responsibility
so
sorely
needed
now
.

Strikes
should
be
declared
illegal
against
corporations
because
disagreements
would
have
to
be
settled
by
government
representatives
acting
as
controllers
of
the
corporation
whose
responsibility
to
the
state
would
now
be
defined
against
proprietorship
because
employees
and
proprietors
must
be
completely
interdependent
,
as
they
are
each
a
part
of
the
whole
.

Strikes
threatening
the
security
of
the
proprietorship
,
if
internally
motivated
,
prevent
a
healthy
relationship
.

These
proposals
would
go
far
toward
creating
the
economic
atmosphere
favoring
growth
of
the
individual
,
who
,
in
turn
,
would
help
us
to
cope
with
runaway
technology
.

Persons
developed
in
today's
corporations
cannot
hope
to
serve
here
--
a
judgment
based
on
experiences
of
my
own
in
business
and
in
activities
outside
.

Then
,
not
many
years
later
,
the
Un-American
Activities
Committee
,
under
the
leadership
of
Martin
Dies
,
pilloried
hundreds
of
decent
,
patriotic
citizens
.

This
hysteria
reached
its
height
under
the
leadership
of
Senator
Joseph
McCarthy
.

Despite
this
danger
,
however
,
we
are
informed
on
every
hand
that
ideas
,
not
machines
,
are
our
finest
tools
;
;

So
all-important
are
ideas
,
we
are
told
,
that
persons
successful
in
business
and
happy
in
social
life
usually
fall
into
two
classes
:
those
who
invent
new
ideas
of
their
own
,
and
those
who
borrow
,
beg
,
or
steal
from
others
.

True
,
ideas
are
important
,
perhaps
life's
most
precious
treasures
.

Shakespeare's
wit
and
wisdom
,
his
profound
insight
into
human
nature
,
have
stood
the
test
of
centuries
.

Shakespeare
did
not
usually
invent
the
incidents
in
his
plays
,
but
borrowed
them
from
old
stories
,
ballads
,
and
plays
,
wove
them
together
,
and
then
breathed
into
them
his
spark
of
life
.

He
took
the
story
of
the
pound
of
flesh
and
had
to
fasten
it
on
someone
.

It
would
have
been
unwise
policy
,
for
instance
,
to
apply
the
pound-of-flesh
characterization
to
the
thrifty
Scotchman
.

Shakespeare
does
not
tell
us
that
Shylock
was
an
aberrant
individual
.

He
sets
him
forth
as
being
typical
of
the
group
.

Let
his
bones
and
his
memory
rest
in
the
fifteenth
century
where
they
belong
;
;

Ideas
,
in
and
of
themselves
,
are
not
necessarily
the
greatest
good
.

Research
,
on
the
other
hand
,
has
shown
many
stepmothers
to
be
eminently
successful
,
some
far
better
than
the
real
mothers
.

Research
into
several
cultures
has
proven
her
position
to
be
a
mistaken
one
.

Most
assuredly
ideas
are
invaluable
.

Ideas
need
to
be
tested
,
and
not
merely
by
argument
and
debate
.

Assuredly
in
our
political
campaigns
there
is
freedom
to
think
,
to
examine
any
and
all
issues
,
and
to
speak
without
restraint
.

May
we
state
with
confidence
that
in
such
an
exhibition
a
republic
will
find
its
greatest
security
?
?

But
it
is
a
clumsy
and
wasteful
process
:
it
can
produce
negative
results
but
not
much
that
is
positive
.

We
would
establish
no
censorship
.

It
is
testimony
to
the
deep
respect
in
which
Mr.
Eisenhower
was
held
by
members
of
all
parties
that
the
moral
considerations
raised
by
his
approach
to
the
matter
were
not
explicitly
to
be
broached
.

But
the
problem
is
one
which
gives
us
the
measure
of
a
man
,
rather
than
a
group
of
men
,
whether
a
group
of
doctors
,
a
group
of
party
members
assembled
at
a
dinner
to
give
their
opinion
,
or
the
masses
of
the
voters
.

It
was
a
response
to
the
conflict
between
political
pressure
and
the
moral
intuition
which
resulted
in
attempts
at
prediction
.

In
no
other
situation
would
a
group
of
doctors
,
struggling
competently
to
improve
the
life
expectancy
of
a
man
beloved
by
the
world
,
be
subjected
to
such
merciless
and
persistent
questioning
,
and
before
they
were
prepared
to
demonstrate
the
kind
of
verbal
precision
which
alone
can
clarify
for
mankind
the
problems
it
faces
.

He
gave
us
a
simile
to
explain
his
admission
that
even
at
the
worst
period
of
his
second
illness
it
never
occurred
to
him
there
was
any
renewed
question
about
his
running
:
as
in
the
Battle
of
the
Bulge
,
he
had
no
fears
about
the
outcome
until
he
read
the
American
newspapers
.

In
this
case
others
should
not
have
had
to
raise
the
doubts
and
fears
.

And
we
had
the
uneasy
sense
that
the
cleavage
between
the
moral
and
the
political
progressed
amid
the
events
which
concern
us
.

Nothing
testifies
more
clearly
to
that
cleavage
than
the
peculiar
editorial
page
appearing
in
a
July
issue
of
Life
Magazine
,
the
issue
which
also
carried
the
second
announcement
of
the
candidacy
.

But
it
is
also
the
climax
to
one
of
the
absorbing
chapters
in
our
current
political
history
.

In
any
other
man
this
reassurance
to
the
electorate
would
have
caused
us
a
profound
moral
shock
.

We
knew
that
it
was
,
as
reassurance
,
the
ironic
fruit
of
a
deeply
moral
nature
.

But
the
fact
remains
that
even
the
unconscious
acceptance
of
himself
as
a
man
of
destiny
divinely
protected
must
be
censored
in
any
man
who
evades
the
responsibility
for
his
major
decisions
,
and
thus
for
imposing
his
will
on
the
people
.

When
the
possibility
that
he
had
not
given
reconsideration
to
so
weighty
a
decision
seemed
to
disconcert
his
questioners
,
Mr.
Eisenhower
was
known
to
make
his
characteristic
statement
to
the
press
that
he
was
not
going
to
talk
about
the
matter
any
more
.

Thinking
had
stopped
;
;

This
does
not
mean
that
the
decision
to
run
for
office
should
inevitably
have
been
revoked
.

Like
Roosevelt
,
he
can
distinguish
an
attitude
toward
a
Russian
leader
he
may
share
with
a
host
of
Americans
from
the
responsibilities
diplomatic
convention
may
impose
upon
him
.

The
capacity
for
making
the
distinctions
of
which
diplomacy
is
compact
,
and
the
facility
with
language
which
can
render
them
into
validity
in
the
eyes
of
other
men
are
the
leader's
means
for
transforming
the
moral
intuition
into
moral
leadership
.

The
making
of
distinctions
,
like
the
perception
of
the
great
distinctions
made
,
is
an
inordinately
difficult
business
.

Only
recently
,
and
perhaps
because
a
television
debate
can
so
effectively
dramatize
President
Kennedy's
extraordinary
mastery
of
detail
,
have
the
abilities
on
which
the
capacity
for
making
distinctions
depend
begun
to
be
clearly
discernible
at
the
level
of
politics
.

The
liberal-conservative
division
,
we
might
observe
in
passing
,
is
not
of
itself
directly
involved
in
a
private
interest
conflict
nor
even
in
struggle
between
ruling
groups
.

The
civilizational
crisis
,
the
third
type
of
change
raises
the
question
``
what
are
we
to
do
''
?
?

On
the
most
primitive
level
.

The
first
involves
a
simple
shift
of
interests
in
the
society
.

Civilization
itself
--
tradition
--
falls
out
of
existence
when
the
human
spirit
itself
becomes
confused
.

It
is
not
enough
for
man
to
be
an
ontological
esse
.

Thus
human
perception
and
human
volition
is
the
immanent
cause
of
all
social
change
and
this
most
truly
when
the
change
reaches
the
civilizational
level
.

If
the
existent
form
is
to
be
retained
new
factors
that
reinforce
it
must
be
introduced
into
the
situation
.

The
retention
of
a
tradition
confronted
with
such
a
crisis
necessitates
the
introduction
of
new
spiritual
forces
into
the
situation
.

And
it
would
seem
that
history
is
a
witness
to
this
truth
.

Within
the
individual
the
reaction
has
been
called
various
names
,
all
,
however
,
pointing
to
the
same
basic
experience
.

Weil
identifies
it
as
being
``
rootless
''
,
Guardini
as
being
``
placeless
''
,
Riesman
as
being
``
lonely
''
.

Both
are
predictably
destined
to
fail
.

Its
essence
lies
in
its
attempt
to
recover
previous
order
through
the
repression
of
disruptive
forces
.

The
implicit
assumption
of
this
response
is
that
history
is
reversible
.

Such
a
response
,
of
course
,
misses
the
point
that
in
crisis
order
is
going
out
of
existence
.

The
most
reaction
can
achieve
is
stasis
,
and
a
stasis
that
can
be
maintained
only
by
the
expenditure
of
an
effort
which
ultimately
exhausts
itself
.

Despite
the
hopelessness
of
the
response
,
it
is
explicable
in
terms
of
the
crisis
of
tradition
itself
.

Since
a
civilizational
crisis
involves
also
a
crisis
in
private
interests
and
in
the
ruling
class
,
reaction
is
normally
found
among
those
who
feel
themselves
to
be
among
the
ruling
class
.

The
reactionary
misses
the
point
that
tradition
exists
ontologically
only
in
the
form
of
psychological-intellectual
relations
.

In
its
defensive
formulations
,
the
theory
will
attack
conscious
change
on
the
grounds
of
the
independent
existence
of
the
community
.

Reaction
is
rooted
in
a
perception
of
tradition
as
a
whole
.

Is
the
Oedipus
complex
,
the
clinical
syndrome
,
material
for
a
tragedy
?
?

And
the
best
way
to
conceal
and
disguise
the
elements
of
an
incest
story
is
not
to
set
out
to
write
an
incest
story
.

If
I
now
risk
some
comparisons
with
Sons
And
Lovers
let
it
be
clear
that
I
am
not
comparing
the
two
works
or
judging
their
merits
;
;

I
am
only
singling
out
differences
in
treatment
of
a
theme
and
the
resultant
effects
.

The
child
grows
rich
on
his
winnings
and
conspires
with
his
uncle
to
make
secret
gifts
of
his
money
to
his
mother
.

I
had
read
the
story
many
times
without
asking
myself
why
it
affected
me
or
caring
why
it
did
.

The
rocking
is
actually
felt
in
the
story
,
a
terrible
and
ominous
rhythm
that
prophesies
the
tragedy
.

The
rocking
has
the
ambiguous
function
of
keeping
the
erotic
undercurrent
silent
and
making
it
present
;
;

And
if
we
understand
the
rocking
as
an
erotic
symbol
we
can
also
see
how
well
it
serves
as
the
symbol
of
impending
tragedy
.

For
this
love
of
the
boy
for
his
mother
is
a
hopeless
and
forbidden
love
,
doomed
by
its
nature
.

We
are
also
struck
by
the
fact
that
this
story
of
a
boy's
love
for
his
mother
does
not
offend
,
while
the
incestuous
love
of
the
man
,
Paul
Morel
,
sometimes
repels
.

I
am
sure
that
none
of
the
effects
of
this
story
were
consciously
employed
by
Lawrence
to
describe
an
oedipal
fantasy
in
childhood
.

He
would
not
have
cared
why
it
emerged
,
he
only
wanted
to
capture
a
memory
to
play
with
it
again
in
his
imagination
and
somehow
to
fix
and
hold
in
the
story
the
disturbing
emotions
that
accompanied
the
fantasy
.

Ortega's
hope
that
modern
psychology
might
yet
bring
forth
a
last
flowering
of
the
novel
has
only
been
partially
fulfilled
.

The
novelist
who
has
been
badly
baptized
in
psychoanalysis
often
gives
us
the
impression
that
since
all
men
must
have
an
Oedipus
complex
all
men
must
have
the
same
faces
.

I
have
argued
that
Oedipus
of
the
Oedipus
complex
has
a
doubtful
future
as
a
tragic
figure
in
literature
.

But
a
writer
who
has
a
taste
for
irony
and
who
sees
incest
in
all
its
modern
dimensions
can
let
his
imagination
work
on
the
disturbing
joke
in
the
incest
myth
,
the
joke
that
strikes
right
at
the
center
of
man's
humanness
.

He
chose
a
medieval
legend
of
incest
,
Gregorius
Vom
Stein
,
and
freely
borrowed
and
parodied
other
myths
of
the
West
,
mixing
themes
,
language
,
peoples
and
times
in
a
master
myth
in
which
the
old
forms
continually
renew
themselves
,
as
in
his
previous
treatment
of
Joseph
.

But
The
Holy
Sinner
is
not
simply
a
retelling
of
old
stories
for
an
old
man's
entertainment
.

And
when
he
retold
the
legend
of
Gregorius
he
interpolated
a
modern
version
in
which
the
medieval
players
speak
contemporary
thoughts
in
archaic
language
;
;

while
they
move
through
the
pageantry
of
the
ancient
incest
myth
and
cover
themselves
through
not-knowing
,
they
reveal
the
unconscious
motive
in
seeking
each
other
and
in
the
last
scene
make
an
extraordinary
confession
of
guilt
in
the
twentieth-century
manner
.

An
ivory
tablet
in
the
infant's
cask
recounts
the
story
of
his
sinful
origins
and
is
preserved
for
the
child
by
the
monks
of
a
monastery
in
the
fishing
village
.

Grigorss
,
at
seventeen
,
learns
his
story
and
goes
forth
as
a
knight
to
uncover
his
origins
.

Grigorss
overcomes
the
suitor
in
battle
,
delivers
the
city
from
its
oppressors
and
marries
Sibylla
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
beautiful
knight
the
moment
she
saw
him
.

Grigorss
comes
to
Rome
and
becomes
a
great
and
beloved
Pope
.

Mother
and
son
recognize
each
other
and
,
in
Mann's
version
of
this
legend
,
make
a
remarkable
confession
of
guilt
to
each
other
,
the
confession
of
unconscious
motive
and
unconscious
knowledge
of
their
true
identities
from
the
time
they
had
first
set
eyes
on
each
other
.

In
recollection
he
has
said
:
``
Natural
or
man-made
objects
kept
coming
into
my
head
,
but
I
would
suppress
them
sternly
''
.

Moreover
,
he
organized
the
movement
of
his
forms
,
within
his
rigorously
shaped
space
,
into
highly
complex
equilibriums
;
;

His
``
monumental
''
abstraction
,
made
up
of
smooth
,
metallic
``
non-objects
''
acting
upon
each
other
with
great
tension
,
won
Helion
much
acclaim
during
the
'thirties
.

As
Helion's
work
showed
more
and
more
nostalgia
for
the
world
of
man
and
nature
,
the
pure
abstractionists
expressed
some
disapproval
;
;

His
canvases
nowadays
bore
titles
frankly
declaring
them
to
be
``
Figures
In
Space
''
,
or
``
Blue
Figure
''
,
or
``
Pink
Figure
''
;
;

I
played
on
it
my
secret
songs
,
unexplained
,
passionate
and
peaceful
''
.

Where
would
it
all
lead
?
?

Instead
of
this
the
1930's
witnessed
a
tragic
economic
depression
,
the
rise
of
Fascist
dictators
in
Europe
,
the
wasting
Civil
War
in
Spain
.

In
New
York
he
was
well
received
by
what
was
then
only
a
small
brave
band
of
non-figurative
artists
,
including
Alexander
Calder
,
George
K.
L.
Morris
,
De
Kooning
,
Holty
and
a
few
others
.

a
``
Double-Figure
''
,
which
went
to
the
Chicago
Art
Institute
,
and
is
considered
by
him
the
most
successful
of
his
abstracts
;
;

They
were
,
in
effect
his
last
testament
to
non-objective
art
.

but
after
war
came
to
Europe
,
he
decided
to
return
to
France
,
arriving
there
in
January
,
1940
.

Its
first
apparition
was
a
long
,
gloomy
column
of
refugees
riding
in
farm
wagons
,
or
pushing
prams
.

After
a
sort
of
death
march
during
four
days
without
food
,
Helion
and
his
comrades
were
shipped
by
cattle-car
to
a
labor
camp
at
an
estate
farm
in
East
Germany
.

``
It
was
then
I
knew
that
they
were
making
war
against
Man
,
the
individual
within
!
!

In
the
prison
camp's
Black
Market
civilian
clothes
were
quietly
bought
and
forged
papers
were
devised
for
him
;
;

during
long
weeks
the
plan
for
his
flight
was
rehearsed
.

Every
morning
contingents
of
prisoners
would
be
sent
out
to
labor
in
nearby
factories
.

One
evening
,
while
a
volley-ball
game
was
being
played
in
the
yard
among
the
prisoners
remaining
there
,
a
simulated
melee
was
staged
--
just
as
the
gates
were
opened
to
admit
other
prisoners
returning
from
work
.

Marquet
held
my
briefcase
;
;

Duclos
ran
toward
Desprez
with
fists
raised
.

not
only
loathing
of
captivity
,
but
a
faith
,
a
hope
that
is
even
stronger
.

They
too
loved
their
families
,
longed
for
their
villages
:
yet
lacked
the
faith
that
drove
one
to
dare
the
fearful
chance
of
escape
''
.

It
was
a
time
of
revelations
for
him
.

Even
the
most
rational
of
men
,
under
great
stress
,
may
be
transported
by
a
new
faith
and
behave
like
mystics
.

In
prison
he
had
been
able
to
sketch
nothing
but
figures
from
life
,
his
guards
,
his
companions
in
misery
.

Before
leaving
for
America
,
he
happened
to
see
his
old
friend
Jean
Arp
and
confided
to
him
his
new
resolutions
.

While
convalescing
in
his
Virginia
home
he
wrote
a
book
recording
his
prison
experiences
and
escape
,
entitled
:
They
Shall
Not
Have
Me
Published
originally
in
(
Helion's
)
English
by
Dutton
&
Co.
of
New
York
,
in
1943
,
the
book
was
received
by
the
press
as
a
work
of
astonishing
literary
power
and
one
of
the
most
realistic
accounts
of
World
War
2
,
from
the
French
side
.

Between
1944
and
1947
Helion
had
a
series
of
one-man
shows
--
at
the
Paul
Rosenberg
Gallery
in
New
York
and
in
Paris
--
of
his
new
realistic
pictures
.

others
were
of
men
doffing
their
hats
to
each
other
,
carrying
umbrellas
with
pomp
,
reading
newspapers
,
or
simply
showing
loaves
of
bread
spread
out
.

If
he
condemns
the
recent
or
the
present
,
he
condemns
the
past
with
no
less
force
.

If
the
barn-burner's
family
produces
a
Flem
Snopes
,
who
personifies
commercialism
and
materialism
in
hyperbolic
crassness
,
the
Compson
family
produces
a
Jason
Compson
4
.

Faulkner
is
a
most
untraditional
traditionalist
.

Faulkner's
is
not
the
mind
of
the
apologist
which
Mr.
O'Donnell
implies
that
it
is
.

The
fact
that
he
has
cast
over
those
materials
the
light
of
a
skeptical
mind
does
not
make
him
any
the
less
Southern
,
I
rather
think
,
for
the
South
has
been
no
more
solid
than
other
regions
except
in
the
political
and
related
areas
where
patronage
and
force
and
intimidation
and
fear
may
produce
a
surface
uniformity
.

It
would
not
be
easy
to
discover
a
more
thoroughly
Southern
pedigree
than
that
of
his
family
.

And
,
after
all
,
he
has
lived
comfortably
at
both
Oxford
,
Mississippi
,
and
Charlottesville
,
Virginia
.

To
believe
otherwise
would
be
unrealistic
.

The
tradition
reached
its
apex
,
perhaps
,
in
the
works
of
Thomas
Nelson
Page
toward
the
end
of
the
century
,
and
reappeared
undiminished
as
late
as
1934
in
the
best-selling
novel
So
Red
The
Rose
,
by
Stark
Young
.

The
chief
literary
antecedents
of
the
Snopes
clan
appeared
in
the
realistic
,
humorous
writing
which
originated
in
the
South
and
the
Southwest
in
the
three
decades
before
the
Civil
War
.

and
George
Washington
Harris
,
whose
Tennessee
hillbilly
character
Sut
Lovingood
perpetrated
more
unmalicious
mischief
and
more
unintended
pain
than
any
other
character
in
literature
.

As
a
consequence
of
the
tensions
thus
produced
in
his
thoughts
and
feelings
,
he
wrote
on
the
one
hand
sketches
of
idealized
hunting
trips
and
on
the
other
an
anecdote
of
the
village
of
Hardscrabble
,
Arkansas
,
where
no
one
had
ever
seen
a
piano
;
;

Some
years
ago
Julian
Huxley
proposed
to
an
audience
made
up
of
members
of
the
British
Association
for
the
Advancement
of
Science
that
``
man's
supernormal
or
extra-sensory
faculties
are
(
now
)
in
the
same
case
as
were
his
mathematical
faculties
during
the
ice
age
''
.

This
text
from
Dr.
Huxley
is
sometimes
used
by
enthusiasts
to
indicate
that
they
have
the
permission
of
the
scientists
to
press
the
case
for
a
wonderful
unfoldment
of
psychic
powers
in
human
beings
.

There
would
be
side-conclusions
to
be
drawn
,
of
course
;
;

The
thing
that
is
notable
in
all
these
discussions
is
the
lack
of
ideological
ardor
.

He
begins
:
``

At
one
time
it
seemed
as
if
the
Soviet
Union
had
done
us
a
favor
by
providing
a
striking
example
of
how
not
to
behave
towards
other
peoples
and
other
nations
.

Shocked
at
the
response
to
our
proclamations
,
we
grow
more
defensive
,
and
worse
,
we
lose
our
sense
of
humor
and
proportion
.

The
picture
is
the
more
treacherous
when
it
misrepresents
the
facts
of
American
life
.

What
is
more
,
the
legends
have
become
so
sacrosanct
that
the
very
habit
of
self-examination
or
self-criticism
smells
of
low
treason
,
and
men
who
practice
it
are
defeatists
and
unpatriotic
scoundrels
.

The
interesting
thing
about
Mr.
Lyford's
approach
,
and
the
approach
of
the
contributors
to
The
Agreeable
Autocracies
(
Oceana
Publications
,
1961
)
to
the
situation
of
American
civilization
,
is
that
it
is
concerned
with
comprehending
the
psychological
relationships
which
are
having
a
decisive
effect
on
American
life
.

The
new
spirit
,
so
well
illustrated
by
Mr.
Lyford's
work
,
is
wholly
free
of
this
anxiety
.

These
institutions
which
Mr.
Lyford
names
``
agreeable
autocracies
''
--
where
did
they
come
from
?
?

Of
one
thing
we
can
be
sure
:
they
were
not
sketched
out
by
the
revolutionary
theorists
of
the
eighteenth
century
who
formulated
the
political
principles
and
originally
shaped
the
political
institutions
of
what
we
term
the
``
free
society
''
.

They
tell
us
,
sir
,
that
we
are
free
,
because
we
have
in
one
hand
a
ballot
,
and
in
the
other
a
stock
certificate
.

Given
the
conceptual
context
within
which
ancient
thought
thrived
,
how
could
anyone
have
questioned
this
principle
?
?

First
,
the
observational
reasons
.

The
obvious
natural
fact
to
ancient
thinkers
was
the
diurnal
rotation
of
the
heavens
.

The
conclusion
--
the
distances
of
the
constellations
did
not
vary
and
their
paths
were
circular
.

The
discoid
shapes
of
sun
and
moon
were
also
felt
to
indicate
the
shape
of
celestial
things
.

This
,
conjoined
with
the
considerations
above
,
made
the
circular
motions
of
heavenly
bodies
appear
an
almost
directly
observed
fact
.

By
distinguishing
superlunary
(
celestial
)
and
sublunary
(
terrestrial
)
existence
,
and
reinforcing
this
with
the
four-element
physics
of
Empedocles
,
Aristotle
came
to
speak
of
the
stars
as
perfect
bodies
,
which
moved
in
only
a
perfect
way
,
viz.
in
a
perfect
circle
.

Because
motion
which
begins
and
ends
at
discrete
places
would
(
e.g.
for
Aristotle
)
be
incomplete
.

Circular
motion
,
however
,
since
it
is
eternal
and
perfectly
continuous
,
lacks
termini
.

Perfect
,
complete
entities
,
if
they
move
at
all
,
do
not
move
towards
what
they
lack
.

Thus
,
circular
motion
is
itself
one
of
the
essential
characteristics
of
completely
perfect
celestial
existence
.

The
stars
constitute
an
order
of
existence
different
from
what
we
encounter
on
earth
.

The
Almagest
and
The
Hypotheses
outline
Ptolemy's
conception
of
his
own
task
as
the
provision
of
computational
tables
,
independent
calculating
devices
for
the
prediction
of
future
planetary
perturbations
.

So
when
textbooks
,
like
that
of
Baker
set
out
drawings
of
the
'
Ptolemaic
System
'
,
complete
with
earth
in
the
center
and
the
seven
heavenly
bodies
epicyclically
arranged
on
their
several
deferents
,
we
have
nothing
but
a
misleading
20th-century
idea
of
what
never
existed
historically
.

He
cannot
,
e.g.
compute
the
retrograde
arc
traveled
by
Mars
,
without
also
making
suppositions
about
the
earth's
own
motion
.

they
are
no
longer
a
puzzling
aspect
of
intricately
variable
,
local
planetary
motions
.

Copernicus
,
by
placing
the
sun
at
the
center
of
the
planetary
universe
,
was
able
to
reduce
the
number
of
epicycles
from
eighty-three
to
seventeen
.

This
was
not
simpler
but
much
more
difficult
than
exercises
within
Ptolemy's
astronomy
.

There
are
in
The
Almagest
no
rules
for
determining
in
advance
whether
a
new
epicycle
will
be
required
for
dealing
with
abberations
in
lunar
,
solar
,
or
planetary
behavior
.

De
Revolutionibus
is
not
just
a
collection
of
facts
and
techniques
.

Solving
astronomical
problems
requires
,
for
Copernicus
,
not
a
random
search
of
unrelated
tables
,
but
a
regular
employment
of
the
rules
defining
the
entire
discipline
.

It
provides
exactly
the
same
reason
.

What
in
The
Almagest
draws
his
fire
?
?

This
arrangement
was
for
Copernicus
literally
monstrous
:
``
With
(
the
Ptolemaists
)
it
is
as
though
an
artist
were
to
gather
the
hands
,
feet
,
head
and
other
members
for
his
images
from
divers
models
,
each
part
excellently
drawn
,
but
not
related
to
a
single
body
;
;

and
since
they
in
no
way
match
each
other
,
the
result
would
be
a
monster
rather
than
a
man
''
.

The
critical
,
rigorous
examinations
of
Nicholas
of
Cusa
and
Nicholas
of
Oresme
provided
the
context
(
a
late
medieval
context
)
for
Nicholas
Copernicus'
own
work
.

Without
abandoning
too
much
,
Copernicus
sought
to
make
orthodox
astronomy
systematically
and
mechanically
acceptable
.

A
smart
,
shrewd
and
ambitious
young
man
,
well
connected
,
and
with
a
knack
for
getting
in
the
good
graces
of
important
people
,
he
was
bound
to
go
far
.

His
father
was
a
good
friend
of
Rabbi
Szold
,
and
Joe
lived
with
the
Szolds
for
a
while
.

so
Cyrus
Adler
became
interested
in
her
friend
Racie
Friedenwald
,
and
Joe
Jastrow
--
the
only
young
man
who
when
he
wrote
had
the
temerity
to
address
her
as
Henrietta
,
and
signed
himself
Joe
--
fell
in
love
with
pretty
sister
Rachel
.

But
that
did
not
prevent
him
from
writing
more
long
letters
,
or
from
coming
to
spend
his
Christmas
vacations
with
the
hospitable
,
lively
Szolds
in
their
pleasant
house
on
Lombard
Street
.

Sadie
,
like
Beth
March
,
suffered
ill
health
--
got
rheumatic
fever
and
had
to
be
careful
of
her
heart
--
but
that
never
dampened
her
spirits
.

The
Szolds
,
like
the
Marches
,
enjoyed
and
loved
living
together
,
even
in
troubled
times
;
;

And
just
as
``
Laurie
''
Lawrence
was
first
attracted
to
bright
Jo
March
,
who
found
him
immature
by
her
high
standards
,
and
then
had
to
content
himself
with
her
younger
sister
Amy
,
so
Joe
Jastrow
,
who
had
also
been
writing
Henrietta
before
he
came
to
Johns
Hopkins
,
had
to
content
himself
with
her
younger
sister
,
pretty
Rachel
.

Cloud
made
an
interesting
statement
in
parting
from
his
client
:
``
I
wanted
to
be
a
lawyer
,
and
Mrs.
Wright
wanted
me
to
be
an
avenging
angel
.

But
every
time
I
suggested
this
to
her
,
Mrs.
Wright
turned
it
down
and
demanded
that
I
go
out
and
punish
Mr.
Wright
.

To
get
an
idea
of
the
embarrassment
and
chagrin
that
was
heaped
upon
Wright
and
Olgivanna
,
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
the
raids
were
sometimes
led
by
Miriam
in
person
.

Miriam
Noel
Wright
said
,
``
Here
I
am
at
my
own
home
,
locked
out
so
I
must
stand
in
the
road
''
!
!

``
Madame
Noel
,
I
think
you
had
better
go
''
,
said
Mrs.
Cupply
.

As
if
to
make
certain
that
Wright
would
be
unable
to
pay
any
settlement
at
all
,
Miriam
wrote
to
prospective
clients
denouncing
him
;
;

she
also
went
to
Washington
and
appealed
to
Senator
George
William
Norris
of
Nebraska
,
the
Fighting
Liberal
,
from
whose
office
a
sympathetic
but
cautious
harrumphing
was
heard
.

Then
,
after
overtures
to
accept
a
settlement
and
go
through
with
a
divorce
,
Miriam
gave
a
ghastly
echo
of
Mrs.
Micawber
by
suddenly
stating
,
``
I
will
never
leave
Mr.
Wright
''
.

Under
this
kind
of
pressure
,
it
is
not
surprising
that
Wright
would
make
sweeping
statements
to
the
newspapers
.

Miriam
had
not
yet
goaded
him
into
mentioning
her
directly
,
but
one
can
feel
the
generalized
anger
in
Wright's
remarks
to
reporters
when
he
was
asked
,
one
morning
on
arrival
in
Chicago
,
what
he
thought
of
the
city
as
a
whole
.

First
,
Wright
said
,
he
was
choked
by
the
smoke
,
which
fortunately
kept
him
from
seeing
the
dreadful
town
.

But
surely
Michigan
Avenue
was
handsome
?
?

Cried
Wright
,
showing
that
automobiles
were
considered
to
be
a
danger
as
early
as
the
1920's
.

``
Take
a
gigantic
knife
and
sweep
it
over
the
Loop
''
,
Wright
said
.

You'll
have
trees
again
.

Later
accounts
blamed
defective
wiring
for
starting
the
fire
;
;

Wright
set
his
loss
at
$200,000
,
a
figure
perhaps
justified
by
the
unique
character
of
the
house
that
had
been
ruined
,
and
the
faultless
taste
that
had
gone
into
the
selection
of
the
prints
and
other
things
that
were
destroyed
.

A
series
of
conferences
with
friends
and
bankers
began
about
this
time
;
;

As
he
made
plans
for
the
new
Taliesin
,
Wright
also
got
on
paper
his
conception
of
a
cathedral
of
steel
and
glass
to
house
a
congregation
of
all
faiths
,
and
the
idea
for
a
planetarium
with
a
sloping
ramp
.

Then
Miriam
varied
the
senseless
psychological
warfare
by
suddenly
withdrawing
a
suit
for
separate
maintenance
that
had
been
pending
,
and
asking
for
divorce
on
the
grounds
of
cruelty
,
with
the
understanding
that
Wright
would
not
contest
it
.

The
Bank
of
Wisconsin
sent
a
representative
to
the
judge's
chambers
in
Madison
to
give
information
on
Wright's
ability
to
meet
the
terms
.

This
exhausted
Wright's
patience
,
and
in
consequence
he
talked
freely
to
reporters
in
a
Madison
hotel
suite
.

``
Volstead
laws
,
speed
laws
,
divorce
laws
''
,
he
said
,
``
as
they
now
stand
,
demoralize
the
individual
,
make
liars
and
law
breakers
of
us
in
one
way
or
another
,
and
tend
to
make
our
experiment
in
democracy
absurd
.

I
realize
,
in
taking
this
stand
,
just
what
it
means
to
me
and
mine
''
.

Here
Wright
gave
a
slight
sigh
of
weariness
,
and
continued
,
``
It
means
more
long
years
lived
across
the
social
grain
of
the
life
of
our
people
,
making
shift
to
live
in
the
face
of
popular
disrespect
and
misunderstanding
as
I
best
can
for
myself
and
those
dependent
upon
me
''
.

His
mentioning
of
Japan
and
Holland
had
been
merely
the
expression
of
wishful
thinking
.

No
matter
what
troubles
might
betide
him
,
this
most
American
of
artists
knew
in
his
heart
he
could
not
function
properly
outside
his
native
land
.

For
pride's
sake
,
I
will
not
say
that
the
coy
and
leering
vade
mecum
of
those
verses
insinuated
itself
into
my
soul
.

The
flame
was
simply
of
a
different
kind
.

It
was
symbolized
(
at
least
for
those
of
us
who
recognized
ourselves
in
the
image
)
by
that
self-consuming
,
elegiac
candle
of
Edna
St.
Vincent
Millay's
,
that
candle
which
from
the
quatrain
where
she
ensconced
it
became
a
beacon
to
us
,
but
which
in
point
of
fact
would
have
had
to
be
as
tall
as
a
funeral
taper
to
last
even
the
evening
,
let
alone
the
night
.

Yet
this
passion
for
passion
,
now
that
I
look
back
on
it
with
passion
spent
,
seems
somewhat
overblown
and
operatic
,
though
as
a
diva
Miss
Millay
perfectly
controlled
her
notes
.

Perhaps
this
is
not
so
little
.

Perhaps
the
mere
fact
that
by
plucking
on
the
nerves
nature
can
awaken
in
the
most
ordinary
of
us
,
temporarily
anyway
,
the
sleeping
poet
,
and
in
poets
can
discover
their
immortality
,
is
the
most
remarkable
of
all
the
remarkable
phenomena
to
which
we
can
attest
?
?

One
could
see
this
chemical
determinant
as
in
itself
a
miracle
.

I
recoil
from
the
very
thought
.

)
,
I
have
never
wanted
to
know
what
you
knew
of
passion
.

We
had
been
walking
quite
briskly
,
for
despite
your
being
so
small
and
me
so
tall
,
your
stride
in
those
days
could
easily
match
mine
.

We
had
stopped
before
a
shop
window
to
assess
its
autumnal
display
,
when
you
suddenly
turned
to
me
,
looking
up
from
beneath
one
of
your
wrong
hats
,
and
with
your
nervous
``
ahem
''
!
!

With
scarcely
a
mumble
of
excuse
,
I
fled
.

What
I
fled
from
was
my
fear
of
what
,
unwittingly
,
you
might
betray
,
without
meaning
to
,
about
my
father
and
yourself
.

For
innocence
,
of
all
the
graces
of
the
spirit
,
is
I
believe
the
one
most
to
be
prayed
for
.

But
to
me
innocence
is
far
less
tangible
.

I
had
long
since
begun
to
lose
my
general
innocence
when
I
lost
my
trust
in
you
,
but
this
special
innocence
I
lost
before
ever
I
loved
,
through
my
discovery
that
one
could
tremble
with
desire
and
even
experience
a
flaming
delight
that
had
nothing
,
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
friendship
or
liking
,
let
alone
with
love
.

Yours
,
but
not
mine
,
was
an
age
in
which
innocence
was
fostered
and
carefully
--
if
not
perhaps
altogether
innocently
--
preserved
.

Before
being
daughter
,
wife
,
or
mother
,
before
being
cultured
(
a
word
now
bereft
both
socially
and
politically
of
the
sheen
you
children
of
frontiersmen
bestowed
on
it
)
,
before
being
sorry
for
the
poor
,
progressive
about
public
health
,
and
prettily
if
somewhat
imprecisely
humanitarian
,
indeed
first
and
foremost
,
you
were
a
lady
.

The
songs
Sandburg
sang
often
reminded
listeners
of
songs
of
a
kindred
character
they
knew
entirely
or
in
fragments
.

The
result
was
a
collection
of
280
songs
,
ballads
,
ditties
,
brought
together
from
all
regions
of
America
,
more
than
one
hundred
never
before
published
:
The
American
Songbag
.

He
is
no
dextrous-fingered
college
boy
but
rather
a
dedicated
,
humble
,
and
bashful
apostle
of
this
instrument
.

At
age
seventy-four
,
he
became
what
he
shyly
terms
a
``
pupil
''
of
Andres
Segovia
,
the
great
guitarist
of
the
Western
world
.

Just
as
in
the
case
of
every
prodigy
child
,
we
must
watch
for
the
efficacy
of
my
teaching
to
show
up
in
the
future
--
if
he
should
master
all
the
strenuous
exercises
I
inflicted
on
him
.

They
went
to
the
pawnshop
of
Joseph
Miller
of
1162
Sixth
Avenue
.

``
He
wanted
Mr.
Sandburg
to
pose
with
one
of
the
guitars
he
had
displayed
behind
glass
in
the
center
of
his
shop
,
but
the
poet
eyed
this
somewhat
distastefully
.

It
comes
and
goes
.

One
fame
is
precious
and
luminous
;
;

``
Ah
,
did
you
once
see
Shelley
plain
''
?
?

She
has
shared
her
husband's
greatness
,
but
only
within
the
confines
of
their
home
;
;

Mrs.
Sandburg
received
a
Phi
Beta
Kappa
key
from
the
University
of
Chicago
and
she
was
busy
writing
and
teaching
when
she
met
Sandburg
.

Her
mother
called
her
Paus'l
,
a
Luxemburg
endearment
meaning
``
pussycat
''
.

(
Two
years
ago
the
photography
editor
of
Vogue
Magazine
titled
his
article
about
Steichen
,
``
The
World's
Greatest
Photographer
''
.

The
parents
compromised
,
however
,
on
a
convent
school
and
Paula
went
to
Ursuline
Academy
in
London
,
Ontario
.

She
had
come
to
a
decision
.

``
And
besides
,
Thorstein
Veblen
was
one
of
the
Chicago
professors
''
.

At
the
University
of
Chicago
she
studied
Whitman
and
Shelley
,
and
became
a
Socialist
.

A
letter
awaited
her
at
Princeton
.

Paula
says
that
even
though
Carl's
letters
usually
began
,
``
Dear
Miss
Steichen
''
,
there
was
an
understanding
from
the
beginning
that
they
would
become
husband
and
wife
.

The
United
States
is
always
ready
to
participate
with
the
Soviet
Union
in
serious
discussion
of
these
or
any
other
subjects
that
may
lead
to
peace
with
justice
.

These
peoples
,
desperately
hoping
to
lift
themselves
to
decent
levels
of
living
must
not
,
by
our
neglect
,
be
forced
to
seek
help
from
,
and
finally
become
virtual
satellites
of
,
those
who
proclaim
their
hostility
to
freedom
.

This
is
a
problem
to
be
solved
not
by
America
alone
,
but
also
by
every
nation
cherishing
the
same
ideals
and
in
position
to
provide
help
.

The
international
economy
of
1960
is
markedly
different
from
that
of
the
early
postwar
years
.

To
remain
secure
and
prosperous
themselves
,
wealthy
nations
must
extend
the
kind
of
co-operation
to
the
less
fortunate
members
that
will
inspire
hope
,
confidence
,
and
progress
.

a
satisfaction
in
hard
work
;
;

The
immediate
need
for
this
kind
of
co-operation
is
underscored
by
the
strain
in
this
nation's
international
balance
of
payments
.

In
1959
our
deficit
in
balance
of
payments
approached
four
billion
dollars
.

Continuing
deficits
of
anything
like
this
magnitude
would
,
over
time
,
impair
our
own
economic
growth
and
check
the
forward
progress
of
the
Free
World
.

A
common
meeting
ground
is
desirable
for
those
nations
which
are
prepared
to
assist
in
the
development
effort
.

If
we
grasp
this
opportunity
to
build
an
age
of
productive
partnership
between
the
less
fortunate
nations
and
those
that
have
already
achieved
a
high
state
of
economic
advancement
,
we
will
make
brighter
the
outlook
for
a
world
order
based
upon
security
and
freedom
.

No
matter
how
earnest
is
our
quest
for
guaranteed
peace
,
we
must
maintain
a
high
degree
of
military
effectiveness
at
the
same
time
we
are
engaged
in
negotiating
the
issue
of
arms
reduction
.

These
remarkable
ships
and
weapons
,
ranging
the
oceans
,
will
be
capable
of
accurate
fire
on
targets
virtually
anywhere
on
earth
.

To
meet
situations
of
less
than
general
nuclear
war
,
we
continue
to
maintain
our
carrier
forces
,
our
many
service
units
abroad
,
our
always
ready
Army
strategic
forces
and
Marine
Corps
divisions
,
and
the
civilian
components
.

It
is
scheduled
to
go
forward
at
a
rate
which
will
steadily
add
to
our
strength
.

Next
I
refer
to
our
program
in
space
exploration
,
which
is
often
mistakenly
supposed
to
be
an
integral
part
of
defense
research
and
development
.

but
they
are
important
foundation
stones
for
more
extensive
exploration
of
outer
space
for
the
ultimate
benefit
of
all
mankind
.

and
for
perfecting
instruments
to
collect
and
transmit
the
data
we
seek
.

Fifth
,
we
have
just
completed
a
year's
experience
with
our
new
space
law
.

The
accomplishment
of
the
many
tasks
I
have
alluded
to
requires
the
continuous
strengthening
of
the
spiritual
,
intellectual
,
and
economic
sinews
of
American
life
.

The
steady
purpose
of
our
society
is
to
assure
justice
,
before
God
,
for
every
individual
.

the
continuing
threat
of
inflation
,
together
with
the
persisting
tendency
toward
fiscal
irresponsibility
;
;

In
the
course
of
its
inquiry
,
it
took
testimony
from
only
seven
witnesses
.

There
,
Begley
lit
a
fire
in
a
wire
basket
,
and
Bang-Jensen
dropped
four
sealed
envelopes
into
the
flames
.

The
method
of
destroying
the
evidence
embarrassed
Paul
Bang-Jensen
.

But
by
the
time
the
papers
were
finally
disposed
of
,
the
group
had
informed
the
world
of
its
purpose
,
its
recommendations
,
and
its
belief
that
Paul
Bang-Jensen
was
not
of
sound
mind
.

The
result
was
the
``
Gross
Report
''
,
prepared
by
Gross
,
as
chairman
,
with
the
assistance
of
two
U.N.
Under
Secretaries
,
Constantin
Stavropoulos
and
Philippe
De
Seynes
.

Never
well
known
,
but
he
had
done
his
work
competently
.

Gross
had
received
Marshall
courteously
and
they
were
discussing
the
case
.

Gross
was
behind
a
clean-top
desk
,
only
a
manila
folder
before
him
.

Gross
swung
his
swivel
chair
.

``
Well
,
how
could
that
have
been
?
?

``
I
think
our
report
sums
up
our
finding
''
,
Gross
answered
.

``
What
I'd
like
you
to
comment
on
is
the
criticism
leveled
at
your
Committee
''
.

In
his
own
words
,
Bang-Jensen
'
took
it
for
granted
that
the
Group
would
report
to
the
Secretary
General
privately
and
not
in
public
.

For
an
instant
he
glared
speechless
at
Marshall
.

``
I
thought
the
entire
report
was
going
to
be
confidential
from
beginning
to
end
.

``
The
reason
for
that
report
was
to
settle
the
matter
of
the
list
.

Hammarskjold
believes
the
U.N.
is
an
organization
that
settles
matters
in
a
procedural
way
.

Peter
Marshall
reflected
.

``
Those
''
!
!

Gross
answered
.

One
was
an
article
on
the
U.N.
by
Alice
Widener
from
the
Cincinnati
Enquirer
.

The
other
was
by
Chesly
Manley
in
the
Chicago
Daily
Tribune
.

``
The
case
was
that
Bang-Jensen
came
up
to
Shann
claiming
he
had
found
further
errors
in
the
report
.

'
I've
found
errors
and
I
want
you
to
look
them
over
.

When
I
speak
of
how
Shann
felt
,
I
know
well
.

``
You
know
,
this
hits
in
many
areas
.

``
This
reveals
some
misunderstanding
on
your
part
.

The
group
conducting
the
review
is
not
holding
formal
hearings
.

It
wished
to
pursue
,
in
the
course
of
this
review
,
questions
arising
from
the
body
of
material
already
in
its
possession
.

The
only
rules
which
I
think
we
shall
follow
will
be
those
of
common
sense
,
justice
,
and
fairness
''
.

Another
week
passed
and
even
the
missionaries
were
enjoying
the
voyage
.

Skipping
was
the
alternative
.

The
crew
of
the
Caravan
never
failed
to
amaze
Ann
,
who
during
her
stay
in
Salem
must
frequently
have
overheard
strong
sailorly
language
.

Even
the
first
wave
of
homesickness
had
passed
,
although
there
were
moments
when
Captain
Heard
pointed
out
on
his
compass
the
direction
of
Bradford
that
she
felt
a
little
twinge
at
her
heart
.

Sometimes
a
ship
would
be
sighted
and
the
Caravan
pass
so
close
that
people
could
easily
be
seen
on
the
distant
deck
.

At
this
time
Harriet
wrote
in
a
letter
which
after
their
finally
landing
in
India
was
sent
to
her
mother
:

``
I
care
not
how
soon
we
reach
Calcutta
,
and
are
placed
in
a
still
room
,
with
a
bowl
of
milk
and
a
loaf
of
Indian
bread
.

I
can
hardly
think
of
this
simple
fare
without
exclaiming
,
oh
,
what
a
luxury
.

But
I
have
been
blest
with
excellent
spirits
,
and
to-day
have
been
running
about
the
deck
,
and
dancing
in
our
room
for
exercise
,
as
well
as
ever
''
.

The
more
Adoniram
looked
at
the
Greek
word
for
baptism
,
the
more
unhappy
he
became
over
its
true
meaning
.

Ann
was
very
troubled
.

How
embarrassing
it
would
be
if
the
newly
appointed
Congregationalist
missionaries
should
suddenly
switch
their
own
beliefs
in
order
to
embrace
Baptist
teachings
!
!

Ann
thrilled
to
the
sight
of
a
delicate
butterfly
and
two
strange
tropical
birds
.

Captain
Heard
gave
orders
for
the
ship
to
be
anchored
in
the
Bay
of
Bengal
until
he
could
obtain
the
services
of
a
reputable
pilot
to
steer
her
through
the
shallow
waters
.

``
He
looks
as
feminine
as
you
can
imagine
''
,
she
decided
.

Slowly
she
moved
up
the
Hooghli
River
,
a
mouth
of
the
mighty
Ganges
,
toward
Calcutta
.

The
Indians
who
came
aboard
ship
to
collect
the
mail
also
interested
her
greatly
,
even
if
she
was
suitably
shocked
,
according
to
the
customs
of
the
society
in
which
she
had
been
reared
,
to
find
them
``
naked
,
except
a
piece
of
cotton
cloth
wrapped
around
their
middle
''
.

At
last
they
saw
Calcutta
,
largest
city
of
Bengal
and
the
Caravan's
destination
.

Founded
August
24
,
1690
by
Job
Charnock
of
the
East
India
Company
,
and
commonly
called
``
The
City
of
Palaces
''
,
it
seemed
a
vast
and
elegant
place
to
Ann
Hasseltine
Judson
.

Solid
brick
buildings
painted
dazzling
white
,
large
domes
and
tall
,
picturesque
palms
stretched
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
,
while
the
wharves
and
harbor
were
filled
with
tall-masted
sailing
ships
.

The
noise
stunned
her
.

Ann
,
pleased
to
see
her
friend
happy
,
was
intrigued
by
the
new
fruits
a
friend
of
Captain
Heard
had
sent
on
board
for
their
enjoyment
.

Cautiously
she
sampled
her
first
pineapple
and
another
fruit
whose
taste
she
likened
to
that
of
``
a
rich
pear
''
.

Six

The
first
act
of
Adoniram
and
Samuel
on
reaching
Calcutta
was
to
report
at
the
police
station
,
a
necessity
when
landing
in
East
India
Company
territory
.

When
he
discovered
they
had
received
from
the
Company's
Court
of
Directors
no
permission
to
live
in
India
,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
they
were
Americans
who
had
been
sent
to
Asia
to
convert
``
the
heathen
''
,
he
became
more
belligerent
than
ever
.

The
reasons
for
the
Whig
joy
on
this
occasion
are
found
to
be
their
expectation
of
regaining
control
of
the
government
,
their
delight
at
the
prospect
of
a
new
war
,
their
hopes
of
having
the
Tories
hanged
,
and
so
on
.

In
answer
to
The
Crisis
,
Swift
produced
The
Publick
Spirit
Of
The
Whigs
,
his
most
extensive
and
bitter
attack
on
his
old
friend
.

By
this
time
,
as
we
shall
see
,
the
Tories
were
already
planning
to
``
punish
''
Steele
for
his
political
writing
by
expelling
him
from
the
House
of
Commons
.

Steele
lost
his
seat
in
Parliament
,
and
his
personal
quarrel
with
Swift
,
by
now
a
public
issue
,
thus
reached
its
climax
.

``
It
is
no
time
''
,
he
writes
,
``
to
talk
with
Hints
and
Innuendos
,
but
openly
and
honestly
to
profess
our
Sentiments
before
our
Enemies
have
compleated
and
put
their
Designs
in
Execution
against
us
''
.

For
example
,
No.
56
printed
the
patent
giving
the
Electoral
Prince
the
title
of
Duke
of
Cambridge
.

Accordingly
the
request
was
granted
,
but
the
Elector
himself
,
who
had
not
been
consulted
by
his
mother
,
rejected
the
proposal
and
recalled
his
agent
Schutz
,
whose
impolitic
handling
of
the
affair
had
caused
the
Hanoverian
interest
to
suffer
and
had
made
Oxford's
dismissal
more
likely
than
ever
.

A
few
days
after
this
Englishman
appeared
,
Defoe
reported
to
Oxford
that
Steele
was
expected
to
move
in
Parliament
that
the
Duke
be
called
over
;
;

It
purports
to
be
a
letter
from
Steele
to
a
friend
at
court
,
who
,
in
Miss
Blanchard's
opinion
,
could
only
be
meant
as
Swift
.

by
this
term
he
means
to
ridicule
their
professions
of
acting
in
the
interest
of
the
Church
despite
their
own
education
and
manner
of
life
--
a
gibe
,
in
other
words
,
at
the
``
Presbyterianism
''
in
Harley's
family
and
at
Bolingbroke's
reputed
impiety
.

The
last
point
was
soon
to
be
included
in
the
``
seditious
''
remarks
used
against
him
in
Parliament
.

In
The
Publick
Spirit
of
the
Whigs
,
it
may
be
noted
,
Swift
himself
contemptuously
dismissed
Steele's
reference
to
his
friend
at
court
:
``
I
suppose
by
the
Style
of
old
Friend
,
and
the
like
,
it
must
be
some
Body
there
of
his
own
Level
;
;

By
now
he
was
undergoing
a
fresh
torrent
of
abuse
from
Tory
papers
and
pamphlets
,
and
action
was
being
taken
to
effect
his
punishment
by
expulsion
from
Parliament
.

He
was
born
in
Savannah
,
Georgia
,
in
1909
.

The
mother
inquired
,
``
Where's
Johnny
,
and
why
did
you
leave
him
''
?
?

``
There
was
nothing
else
I
could
do
''
,
the
maid
answered
,
satisfied
with
a
rather
vague
explanation
.

With
her
son
evidencing
so
strong
a
musical
bent
his
mother
could
do
little
else
but
get
him
started
on
the
study
of
music
--
though
she
waited
until
he
was
ten
--
beginning
with
the
piano
and
following
that
with
the
trumpet
.

Young
Mercer
showed
a
remarkable
lack
of
aptitude
for
both
instruments
.

From
his
playmates
in
Savannah
,
Mercer
had
picked
up
,
along
with
a
soft
Southern
dialect
,
traces
also
of
the
Gullah
dialects
of
Africa
.

During
the
summers
,
while
he
was
still
in
school
,
Mercer
worked
for
his
father's
firm
as
a
messenger
boy
.

Everett
Miller
,
then
assistant
director
for
the
Garrick
Gaieties
,
a
Theatre
Guild
production
,
needed
a
lyricist
for
a
song
he
had
written
;
;

he
just
happened
not
to
need
any
actor
at
the
moment
,
however
.

He
had
yet
to
meet
Harold
Arlen
,
for
although
they
had
``
collaborated
''
on
``
Satan's
Li'l
Lamb
''
,
Mercer
and
Harburg
had
worked
from
a
lead
sheet
the
composer
had
furnished
them
.

The
countrywide
success
of
``
Lazybones
''
and
``
And
The
Angels
Sing
''
could
only
lead
to
Hollywood
,
where
,
besides
Harold
Arlen
,
Mercer
collaborated
with
Harry
Warren
,
Jimmy
Van
Heusen
,
Richard
Whiting
,
Walter
Donaldson
,
Jerome
Kern
,
and
Arthur
Schwartz
.

''
,
and
``
Too
Marvelous
For
Words
''
(
all
with
Richard
Whiting
)
;
;

I
wouldn't
hear
from
him
for
a
couple
of
weeks
,
then
he'd
come
around
with
the
completed
lyric
''
.

Arlen
is
one
of
the
few
(
possibly
the
only
)
composer
Mercer
has
been
able
to
work
with
so
closely
,
for
they
held
their
meetings
in
Arlen's
study
.

``
I
couldn't
write
with
them
in
the
same
room
with
me
,
but
I
could
with
Harold
.

Arlen
,
too
,
worked
on
other
projects
at
the
same
time
with
old
friend
Ted
Koehler
.

Besides
doing
a
single
song
,
``
When
The
Sun
Comes
Out
''
,
they
worked
on
the
ambitious
American-Negro
Suite
,
for
voices
and
piano
,
as
well
as
songs
for
films
.

Thoroughly
modern
in
treatment
,
they
are
at
the
same
time
,
full
of
simple
sincerity
which
invariably
characterizes
genuine
Negro
folk-music
and
are
by
no
means
to
be
confused
with
the
average
'
Broadway
Spirituals
'
which
depend
for
their
racial
flavor
upon
sundry
allusions
to
the
'
Amen
Corner
'
,
'
judgement
Day
,
'
Gabriel's
Horn
,
and
a
frustrated
devil
--
with
a
few
random
hallelujahs
thrown
in
for
good
measure
.

A
much
larger
room
,
adjacent
to
the
lavatory
,
served
as
a
passageway
to
and
from
the
skimpy
toilet
.

It
so
happened
that
sports
writer
Arthur
Robinson
got
out
of
the
hospital
that
morning
after
promising
his
doctor
that
he
be
back
in
an
hour
or
two
to
continue
his
convalescence
.

Mr.
Herford's
appearance
was
that
of
a
frustrated
gnome
.

He
seemed
timid
(
at
first
,
)
wore
nose
glasses
from
which
a
black
ribbon
dangled
,
and
was
no
bigger
than
a
jockey
.

In
the
jakes
,
after
Robbie
and
his
crutches
were
properly
stowed
,
Mr.
Herford
went
to
the
adjoining
facility
.

He
had
barely
assumed
his
stance
there
when
a
fat
fellow
charged
through
the
doorway
.

Mr.
Herford
touched
the
fat
man's
arm
.

When
,
in
my
enthusiasm
,
I
proposed
the
party
,
my
city
editor
(
who
disliked
the
club
and
many
of
its
members
)
tried
to
block
my
participation
in
the
gala
event
.

The
Hetman's
physical
aspects
were
not
those
of
a
savage
rider
of
the
steppes
.

Runyon
,
for
his
part
,
had
a
contemptuous
regard
for
Mr.
Watson
.

``
He's
a
wrong-o
''
,
said
Runyon
,
``
and
I
wouldn't
trust
him
as
far
as
I
could
throw
the
Statue
of
Liberty
''
.

Why
'
''
?
?

Some
of
the
Hetman's
``
ideas
''
were
dream-ridden
,
vaguely
imparted
,
and
at
times
preposterous
.

``
I
can
tell
you
this
much
''
,
he
said
.

It's
bigger
than
the
Armistice
''
.

I
shall
tell
of
it
later
on
.

Mr.
Baer
obtained
a
supply
of
crepe
hair
and
spirit-gum
from
an
actor
at
the
Friars
.

As
for
myself
,
I
had
on
an
enormous
black
``
muff
''
.

Just
then
a
reporter
telephoned
in
from
the
Bronx
to
give
the
rewrite
desk
an
account
of
a
murder
.

The
Hetman
told
me
to
take
the
story
over
the
phone
and
to
write
it
.

He
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
at
me
,
then
went
on
to
the
city
desk
to
deliver
his
``
Today
''
column
.

He
had
been
``
seeing
things
''
.

It
seems
to
me
now
,
in
a
long
backward
glance
,
that
many
of
the
Hetman's
conceits
and
odd
actions
--
together
with
his
grim
posture
when
brandishing
the
hatchet
in
the
name
of
Mr.
Hearst
--
were
keyed
with
the
tragedy
which
was
to
close
over
him
one
day
.

That
word
was
withheld
when
the
need
of
it
seemed
the
measure
of
his
despair
.

that
is
,
until
I
became
an
editor
,
hence
,
in
his
eyes
,
a
rival
.

Somehow
I
think
that
Watson
paid
more
attention
to
me
than
he
otherwise
might
have
because
his
foe
,
Colonel
Van
Hamm
,
wouldn't
touch
me
with
a
ten-foot
blue
pencil
.

Watson
showed
this
wire
to
Colonel
Van
Hamm
.

Mama
knew
she
was
playing
her
son's
favorite
pieces
and
feeling
close
to
him
,
and
did
not
disturb
her
.

He
brought
her
shawls
.

The
President
used
to
look
at
it
with
a
ghost
of
a
smile
.

The
name
inside
the
envelope
was
``
Cynthia
''
.

Mrs.
Coolidge
would
knit
,
and
the
President
would
sit
reading
,
or
playing
with
the
many
pets
around
them
.

Now
and
then
,
the
President
would
call
for
``
Little
Jack
,
Master
of
the
Hounds
''
,
which
was
his
nickname
for
a
messenger
who
had
worked
in
the
White
House
since
Teddy
Roosevelt's
administration
,
and
discuss
the
welfare
of
some
one
of
the
animals
.

It
is
not
the
same
dress
as
the
one
on
her
manikin
in
the
Smithsonian
.

There
is
a
long
train
flowing
from
the
shoulders
.

I
still
have
the
dress
,
and
I
hope
to
give
it
to
the
Smithsonian
Institution
as
a
memento
,
or
,
as
I
more
fondly
hope
,
to
present
it
to
a
museum
containing
articles
showing
the
daily
lives
of
the
Presidents
--
if
I
can
get
it
organized
.

He
showed
them
what
to
do
,
and
taught
them
how
to
keep
the
maids
around
the
White
House
in
a
state
of
terror
.

Mama
didn't
know
what
to
do
--
whether
to
tell
on
Rob
Roy
or
not
--
since
she
had
the
ear
of
Mrs.
Coolidge
more
than
the
other
maids
.

But
she
was
afraid
the
First
Lady
would
not
understand
,
because
Rob
Roy
was
a
perfect
angel
with
the
First
Family
.

Every
day
,
when
the
President
took
his
nap
,
Rob
Roy
would
stretch
out
on
the
window
seat
near
him
,
like
a
perfect
gentleman
,
and
stare
thoughtfully
out
the
window
,
or
he
would
take
a
little
nap
himself
.

then
he
would
bark
to
let
everyone
know
the
coast
was
clear
.

It
was
a
high
mark
for
Mama
.

If
the
Stearns
were
not
there
,
grace
would
be
omitted
.

Speaking
of
breakfast
,
the
President
inaugurated
a
new
custom
--
that
of
conducting
business
at
the
breakfast
table
.

So
the
President
would
make
a
hearty
breakfast
official
by
inviting
Government
officials
to
attend
.

Mama
said
that
if
Presidents
were
supposed
to
be
colorful
,
Mr.
Coolidge
certainly
made
a
good
president
.

You
can
imagine
that
he
got
pretty
good
service
.

The
wool
would
become
frazzled
around
the
edges
from
blowing
in
the
wind
,
and
Mama
would
mend
it
.

She
used
to
tell
me
,
``
When
I
stand
there
and
look
at
the
flag
blowing
this
way
and
that
way
,
I
have
the
wonderful
,
safe
feeling
that
Americans
are
protected
no
matter
which
way
the
wind
blows
''
.

She
wore
grey
every
day
,
and
white
every
evening
.

Mama
knew
that
she
was
out
of
mourning
when
she
finally
wore
bright
colors
.

She
looked
up
and
saw
that
,
without
knowing
it
,
Mrs.
Coolidge
was
holding
it
aloft
.

The
Coolidges
did
not
always
live
at
the
White
House
during
the
Presidency
.

In
the
arena
of
power
Jews
have
at
one
time
or
another
been
somebody's
ally
;
;

Diversity
of
perception
,
yes
;
;

Conventional
images
of
Jews
have
this
in
common
with
all
perceptions
of
a
configuration
in
which
one
feature
is
held
constant
:
images
can
be
both
true
and
false
.

The
genuinely
interesting
question
,
then
,
becomes
:
What
factors
determine
the
degree
of
realism
or
distortion
in
conventional
images
of
Jews
?
?

In
accounting
for
realism
or
distortion
two
sets
of
factors
can
be
usefully
distinguished
:
current
intelligence
;
;

He
may
have
entered
the
situation
with
predispositions
that
prepared
him
to
act
uncritically
in
the
press
of
affairs
.

they
include
harmonies
and
conflicts
within
the
whole
man
,
and
mechanisms
whereby
inner
components
are
more
or
less
smoothly
met
.

Many
selections
are
themselves
convincing
contributions
to
this
appraisal
.

What
shall
these
effects
be
?
?

What
are
the
historical
trends
in
this
country
and
abroad
in
the
extent
to
which
these
goals
are
effectively
realized
?
?

The
discussion
is
therefore
limited
to
a
suggested
procedure
for
realizing
at
least
some
of
the
potential
importance
of
this
volume
for
future
policy
.

As
a
groundwork
for
the
proposal
I
give
some
attention
to
the
first
task
enumerated
above
,
the
clarification
of
goal
.

Community
decision
makers
must
make
up
their
minds
whether
a
claim
is
acceptable
to
the
larger
community
in
terms
of
prevailing
expectations
regarding
members
of
nation
states
.

We
know
that
much
is
made
of
the
multiplicity
and
ambiguity
of
the
identities
that
cluster
around
the
key
symbol
of
the
Jew
.

It
is
not
implied
that
formal
principles
and
procedures
are
so
firmly
entrenched
within
the
public
order
of
the
world
community
or
even
of
free
commonwealths
that
they
will
control
in
all
circumstances
involving
Jews
and
Gentiles
during
coming
years
.

It
is
not
difficult
to
anticipate
circumstances
in
which
negative
tensions
will
cumulate
;
;

The
formal
position
of
Americans
who
identify
themselves
with
one
or
more
of
the
several
identities
of
the
Jewish
symbol
is
already
clear
;
;

During
moments
of
intense
crisis
the
responsibility
of
political
leaders
is
overwhelming
.

By
the
same
test
predispositions
destructive
of
human
personality
exercise
their
most
sinister
impact
,
with
the
result
that
men
of
good
will
are
often
trapped
and
nullified
.

Among
measures
in
anticipation
of
crisis
are
plans
to
inject
into
the
turmoil
as
assistants
of
key
decision
makers
qualified
persons
who
are
cognizant
of
the
corrosive
effect
of
crisis
upon
personal
relationships
and
are
also
able
to
raise
calm
and
realistic
voices
when
overburdened
leaders
near
the
limit
of
self-control
.

We
are
learning
how
to
do
these
things
in
some
of
the
vast
organized
structures
of
modern
society
;
;

the
process
can
be
accelerated
.

A
truism
is
that
the
time
to
prepare
for
the
worst
is
when
times
are
best
.

Now
an
abiding
difficulty
of
paragraphs
like
the
foregoing
is
that
they
appear
to
preach
;
;

I
assume
that
the
number
of
readers
of
this
anthology
who
regard
themselves
as
morally
perfect
is
small
,
and
that
most
readers
are
willing
to
consider
procedures
by
which
they
may
gain
more
insight
into
themselves
and
better
understanding
of
others
.

The
traditional
method
proceeds
by
the
technique
of
free
association
,
punctuated
by
interpretations
proposed
by
the
psychoanalytic
interviewer
.

What
we
have
in
mind
does
have
something
in
common
with
the
goals
of
psychoanalysis
and
with
the
methods
by
which
they
are
sought
.

For
what
we
propose
,
however
,
a
psychoanalyst
is
not
necessary
,
even
though
one
aim
is
to
enable
the
reader
to
get
beneath
his
own
defenses
--
his
defenses
of
himself
to
himself
.

The
symposium
provides
an
opportunity
to
confront
the
self
with
specific
statements
which
were
made
at
particular
times
by
identifiable
communicators
who
were
addressing
definite
audiences
--
and
throughout
several
hundred
pages
everyone
is
talking
about
the
same
key
symbol
of
identification
.

An
advantage
of
being
exposed
to
such
specificity
about
an
important
and
recurring
feature
of
social
reality
is
that
it
can
be
taken
advantage
of
by
the
reader
to
examine
covert
as
well
as
overt
resonances
within
himself
,
resonances
triggered
by
explicit
symbols
clustering
around
the
central
figure
of
the
Jew
.

There
is
a
risk
that
instead
of
teaching
a
person
how
to
be
himself
,
reading
fiction
and
drama
may
teach
him
how
to
be
somebody
else
.

Moreover
,
if
the
critic
instructs
his
audience
in
what
to
see
in
a
work
,
he
is
contributing
to
this
pseudo-thinking
;
;

It
is
possible
that
the
study
of
literature
affects
the
conscience
,
the
morality
,
the
sensitivity
to
some
code
of
``
right
''
and
``
wrong
''
.

Literature
may
be
said
to
give
people
a
sense
of
purpose
,
dedication
,
mission
,
significance
.

One
of
the
most
salient
features
of
literary
value
has
been
deemed
to
be
its
influence
upon
and
organization
of
emotion
.

The
Aristotelian
notion
of
catharsis
,
the
purging
of
emotion
,
is
a
persistent
and
viable
one
.

This
is
given
some
expression
in
Beardsley's
notion
of
harmony
and
the
resolution
of
indecision
.

William
Wimsatt
and
Cleanth
Brooks
,
it
seems
to
me
,
have
a
penetrating
insight
into
the
way
in
which
this
control
is
effected
:
``
For
if
we
say
poetry
is
to
talk
of
beauty
and
love
(
and
yet
not
aim
at
exciting
erotic
emotion
or
even
an
emotion
of
Platonic
esteem
)
and
if
it
is
to
talk
of
anger
and
murder
(
and
yet
not
aim
at
arousing
anger
and
indignation
)
--
then
it
may
be
that
the
poetic
way
of
dealing
with
these
emotions
will
not
be
any
kind
of
intensification
,
compounding
,
or
magnification
,
or
any
direct
assault
upon
the
affections
at
all
.

Here
I
do
not
mean
catharsis
,
the
discharge
of
emotion
.

The
limits
are
suggested
by
an
imaginary
experiment
:
contrast
the
perceptual
skill
of
English
professors
with
that
of
their
colleagues
in
discriminating
among
motor
cars
,
political
candidates
,
or
female
beauty
.

I
think
these
attributes
cluster
,
but
I
have
no
evidence
.

We
are
all
,
though
many
of
us
are
snobbish
enough
to
wish
to
deny
it
,
in
far
closer
sympathy
with
the
art
of
the
music-hall
and
picture-palace
than
with
Chaucer
and
Cimabue
,
or
even
Shakespeare
and
Titian
.

By
an
effort
of
historical
sympathy
we
can
cast
our
minds
back
into
the
art
of
a
remote
past
or
an
alien
present
,
and
enjoy
the
carvings
of
cavemen
and
Japanese
colour-prints
;
;

Such
study
may
take
many
forms
.

When
we
assert
the
value
of
such
study
,
we
find
ourselves
committed
to
an
important
assumption
.

Most
students
of
literature
,
whether
they
call
themselves
scholars
or
critics
,
are
ready
to
argue
that
it
is
possible
to
understand
literary
works
as
well
as
to
enjoy
them
.

But
,
in
general
,
we
may
argue
that
the
student
can
direct
the
primary
emphasis
of
his
attention
toward
one
or
the
other
.

An
idea
,
let
us
say
,
may
be
roughly
defined
as
a
theme
or
topic
with
which
our
reflection
may
be
concerned
.

It
is
obvious
that
the
historian
who
seeks
to
recapture
the
ideas
that
have
motivated
human
behavior
throughout
a
given
period
will
find
the
art
and
literature
of
that
age
one
of
his
central
and
major
concerns
,
by
no
means
a
mere
supplement
or
adjunct
of
significant
historical
research
.

Let
us
survey
for
a
moment
the
development
of
modern
thought
--
turning
our
attention
from
the
Reformation
toward
the
revolutionary
and
romantic
movements
that
follow
and
dwelling
finally
on
more
recent
decades
.

These
moments
are
historical
events
in
the
lives
of
individual
authors
with
which
the
student
of
comparative
literature
must
be
frequently
concerned
.

Again
the
student
of
evolutionary
biology
will
find
a
fascinating
,
if
to
our
minds
grotesque
,
anticipation
of
the
theory
of
chance
variations
and
the
natural
elimination
of
the
unfit
in
Lucretius
,
who
in
turn
seems
to
have
borrowed
the
concept
from
the
philosopher
Empedocles
.

If
within
one
year
you
can
make
a
success
out
of
the
American
,
you
can
practically
name
your
own
salary
thereafter
.

Of
course
,
if
you
don't
make
the
American
a
success
,
Hearst
will
have
no
further
use
for
you
''
.

The
blue-eyed
Watson
decided
that
he
would
dislike
living
in
New
York
,
and
the
deal
fell
through
.

Six
of
the
railroads
carrying
coal
to
Tidewater
from
the
Pennsylvania
fields
,
Hearst
said
,
not
only
had
illegal
agreements
with
coal
operators
but
owned
outright
at
least
eleven
mines
.

They
were
repelled
by
his
noisy
newspapers
,
his
personal
publicity
,
his
presumptuous
campaign
for
the
Presidential
nomination
,
and
by
the
swelling
cloud
of
rumor
about
his
moral
lapses
.

Platoons
of
Hearst
agents
were
traveling
from
state
to
state
in
a
surprisingly
successful
search
for
delegates
at
the
coming
convention
,
and
there
were
charges
that
money
was
doing
a
large
part
of
the
persuading
.

He
ordered
his
editors
to
tone
down
on
sensationalism
and
to
refrain
from
using
such
words
as
``
seduction
''
,
``
rape
''
,
``
abortion
''
,
``
criminal
assault
''
and
``
born
out
of
wedlock
''
.

In
a
story
headed
,
``
Hearst
Offers
Cash
''
,
the
Republican
New
York
Tribune
spread
the
money
rumor
,
quoting
an
unnamed
``
Hearst
supporter
''
as
saying
:

This
,
it
is
urged
,
would
relieve
the
national
committee
from
the
necessity
of
appealing
to
the
trust
magnates
.

The
alternative
to
this
is
that
if
a
conservative
candidate
is
nominated
the
national
committee
will
have
to
appeal
to
the
trusts
for
their
campaign
funds
,
and
in
doing
this
will
incur
obligations
which
would
make
a
Democratic
victory
absolutely
fruitless
.

It
has
been
a
long
time
since
he
has
seen
any
campaign
money
,
and
when
the
proposition
is
laid
down
to
him
as
the
friends
of
Mr.
Hearst
are
laying
it
down
these
days
he
is
quite
likely
to
get
aboard
the
Hearst
bandwagon
''
.

In
his
own
state
of
New
York
,
the
two
Democratic
bellwethers
,
State
Leader
Hill
and
Tammany
Boss
Murphy
,
were
saying
nothing
openly
against
Hearst
but
industriously
boosting
their
own
favorites
,
Murphy
being
for
Cleveland
and
Hill
for
Parker
.

''

``
The
nomination
of
Hearst
would
compass
the
ruin
of
the
party
''
,
Carmack
said
.

``
There's
nothing
like
buildin'
from
the
bottom
up
.

Our
state
has
been
overrun
with
a
gang
of
paid
agents
and
retainers
.

The
Hearst
dollar
mark
is
all
over
them
.

In
his
fight
for
the
Illinois
and
Indiana
delegations
,
Hearst
made
several
trips
to
Chicago
to
confer
with
Andrew
Lawrence
,
the
former
San
Francisco
Examiner
man
who
was
now
his
Chicago
kingpin
,
and
once
to
meet
with
Bryan
.

``
I
should
,
of
course
''
,
he
said
,
``
like
any
other
man
,
be
honored
and
gratified
should
the
Democrats
see
fit
to
nominate
me
.

But
I
do
not
have
to
be
bribed
by
office
to
be
a
Democrat
.

The
outstanding
example
was
in
Garibaldi
And
The
Thousand
,
where
he
made
use
of
unpublished
papers
of
Lord
John
Russell
and
English
consular
materials
to
reveal
the
motives
which
led
the
British
government
to
permit
Garibaldi
to
cross
the
Straits
of
Messina
.

First
The
Life
Of
John
Bright
appeared
and
seven
years
later
Lord
Grey
Of
The
Reform
Bill
.

In
the
story
of
Bright
and
the
Corn
Law
agitation
,
the
Crimean
War
,
the
American
Civil
War
,
and
the
franchise
struggle
Trevelyan
reflects
something
of
the
moral
power
which
enabled
this
independent
man
to
exercise
so
immense
an
influence
over
his
fellow
countrymen
for
so
long
.

Because
Bright's
speeches
were
so
much
a
part
of
him
,
there
are
long
and
numerous
quotations
,
which
,
far
from
making
the
biography
diffuse
,
help
to
give
us
the
feel
of
the
man
.

Characteristically
,
Trevelyan
enjoyed
writing
the
work
.

The
theme
of
glorious
summer
coming
after
a
long
winter
of
discontent
and
repression
was
,
he
has
told
us
,
congenial
to
his
artistic
sense
.

And
Grey's
Northumberland
background
was
close
to
Trevelyan's
own
.

But
after
1832
,
the
narrative
tends
to
lose
its
balanced
,
many-sided
quality
and
to
become
a
medley
of
topics
,
often
unconnected
by
any
single
thread
.

Economic
analysis
was
never
Trevelyan's
strong
point
and
the
England
of
the
industrial
transformation
cries
out
for
economic
analysis
.

In
1924
Trevelyan
traveled
to
the
United
States
,
where
he
delivered
the
Lowell
lectures
at
Harvard
University
.

The
History
takes
too
much
for
granted
to
serve
as
a
text
for
other
than
English
schoolboys
,
and
like
Britain
in
the
nineteenth
century
it
deteriorates
badly
as
it
goes
beyond
1870
.

Trevelyan's
excursions
into
contemporary
history
were
rarely
happy
ones
.

Living
pictures
of
the
early
boroughs
,
country
life
in
Tudor
and
Stuart
times
,
the
impact
of
the
industrial
revolution
compete
with
sensitive
surveys
of
language
and
literature
,
the
common
law
,
parliamentary
development
.

His
nationalism
was
not
a
new
characteristic
,
but
its
self-consciousness
,
even
its
self-satisfaction
,
is
more
obvious
in
a
book
that
stretches
over
the
long
reach
of
English
history
.

Tolerance
and
compromise
,
social
justice
and
civil
liberty
,
are
today
too
often
in
short
supply
for
one
to
be
overly
critical
of
Trevelyan's
emphasis
on
their
central
place
in
the
English
tradition
.

Four
years
after
the
publication
of
The
History
Of
England
,
the
first
volume
of
Trevelyan's
Queen
Anne
trilogy
appeared
.

Blenheim
was
followed
in
rapid
succession
by
Ramillies
And
The
Union
With
Scotland
and
by
The
Peace
And
The
Protestant
Succession
,
the
three
forming
together
a
detailed
picture
of
England
under
Queen
Anne
.

He
saw
the
age
as
one
in
which
Britain
``
settled
her
free
constitution
''
and
attained
her
modern
place
in
the
world
.

As
I
got
off
the
trolley
at
Kehl
bridge
the
next
morning
,
I
was
met
by
what
looked
like
5,000
students
,
some
of
whom
were
carrying
sticks
apparently
for
the
coming
``
battle
''
with
the
police
.

If
one
finger
is
raised
against
the
authorities
,
all
our
moral
power
will
vanish
.

As
usual
,
the
press
photographers
were
on
hand
.

The
waspish
man
stopped
me
three
paces
from
the
bicycle
barricade
,
and
asked
me
in
French
if
I
had
papers
to
leave
France
.

He
examined
it
carefully
,
handed
it
back
and
said
,
``
Eh
bien
,
you
may
leave
France
''
.

``
No
,
I
have
no
permission
to
enter
Germany
''
,
I
told
him
.

``
Line
?
?

Obviously
I'm
stuck
on
the
line
between
the
two
countries
''
.

``
Mais
non
''
,
the
Interior
Ministry
man
coaxed
,
``
you
may
come
back
to
Strasbourg
,
now
,
if
you
wish
''
.

You
are
still
in
France
''
.

From
the
crowd
were
coming
cries
of
``
He's
right
''
!
!

``
There
must
be
a
line
''
!
!

Seeing
their
hesitation
,
I
said
,
``
Well
,
until
I
have
permission
to
enter
Germany
,
or
a
visa
to
re-enter
France
,
I
shall
be
obliged
to
remain
here
on
the
line
between
two
countries
''
,
whereupon
I
moved
to
the
side
of
the
road
,
parked
my
backpack
against
the
small
guardhouse
on
the
sidewalk
,
sat
down
,
took
out
my
typewriter
,
and
began
typing
the
above
conversation
.

The
students
crowded
around
asking
questions
,
slapping
me
on
the
back
,
and
generally
being
friendly
.

``
It
will
be
very
cold
''
.

``
I
have
a
small
sports
shop
in
Strasbourg
''
.

The
wind
from
the
Rhine
was
damp
and
chill
,
necessitating
a
fire
for
warmth
.

As
the
field
on
which
my
tent
was
pitched
was
a
favorite
natural
playground
for
the
kids
of
the
neighborhood
,
I
had
made
many
friends
among
them
,
taking
part
in
their
after-school
games
and
trying
desperately
to
translate
Grimm's
Fairy
Tales
into
an
understandable
French
as
we
gathered
around
the
fire
in
front
of
the
tent
.

It
was
a
merry
if
somewhat
soggy
Christmas
for
me
that
year
.

Twenty
thousand
world
citizens
at
Stuttgart
had
signed
a
petition
inviting
me
to
visit
their
town
.

May
we
have
a
word
with
you
''
?
?

She
entreated
me
to
see
a
doctor
,
and
when
I
refused
,
brought
one
out
to
see
me
.

Esther
,
mistaking
my
hesitation
,
assured
me
that
the
hospital
expense
would
be
taken
care
of
by
a
leading
merchant
in
Strasbourg
whom
she
had
already
approached
.

At
that
moment
,
up
walked
a
tall
young
man
with
glasses
who
announced
himself
as
a
world
citizen
from
Basel
,
Switzerland
.

Without
preliminaries
,
Esther
asked
him
,
``
If
you
are
a
world
citizen
,
will
you
take
Garry
Davis'
place
in
his
tent
while
he
goes
to
the
hospital
''
?
?

``
You
have
just
enlisted
for
the
'
Rhine
Campaign
'
''
.

His
hat
was
gone
,
the
tears
were
streaming
from
his
eyes
.

Eight
hundred
and
sixty-five
Rebels
surrendered
within
their
works
and
a
thousand
more
were
captured
or
surrendered
themselves
that
night
and
the
next
day
.

It
was
the
only
sizable
assault
upon
infantry
and
artillery
behind
breastworks
successfully
made
by
either
side
during
the
Atlanta
campaign
.

The
Fourteenth
Regiment
of
Ohio
Volunteers
lost
one-third
of
its
numbers
within
a
few
minutes
,
among
them
being
several
men
whose
time
of
service
had
expired
but
who
had
volunteered
to
advance
with
their
regiment
.

The
dispatch
must
have
been
sent
after
sundown
on
September
1
.

The
next
day
Sherman
issued
his
orders
ending
the
campaign
and
pulled
his
armies
back
to
Atlanta
.

Thomas
thanked
his
men
for
their
tenacity
of
purpose
,
unmurmuring
endurance
,
cheerful
obedience
,
brilliant
heroism
and
high
qualities
in
battle
.

Sherman
felt
that
his
own
part
in
the
campaign
was
skillful
and
well
executed
but
that
the
slowness
of
a
part
of
his
army
robbed
him
of
the
larger
fruits
of
victory
.

In
the
midst
of
this
gloom
,
at
10:05
P.M.
on
September
2
,
Slocum's
telegram
to
Stanton
,
``
General
Sherman
has
taken
Atlanta
''
,
shattered
the
talk
of
a
negotiated
peace
and
boosted
Lincoln
into
the
White
House
.

To
the
Republicans
no
victory
could
have
been
more
complete
.

Halleck
described
it
as
the
most
brilliant
of
the
war
.

But
,
so
far
as
its
territorial
objectives
were
concerned
,
the
campaign
was
successful
.

Within
the
narrow
frame
of
military
tactics
,
too
,
the
experts
agree
that
the
campaign
was
brilliant
.

In
seventeen
weeks
the
military
front
was
driven
southward
more
than
100
miles
.

A
few
weeks
later
the
maps
were
being
divided
into
squares
and
a
position
was
described
as
being
``
about
lots
239
,
247
and
272
with
pickets
forward
as
far
as
196
''
.

This
system
was
dependent
upon
identical
maps
and
Thomas
supplied
them
from
a
mobile
lithograph
press
.

Orders
of
the
day
began
to
specify
the
standard
map
for
the
movement
.

To
the
Rebels
it
seemed
as
if
Sherman
carried
tunnels
and
bridges
in
his
pockets
.

As
always
,
the
ranks
worked
out
new
and
better
tactics
,
but
there
was
brilliance
in
the
way
the
field
commands
adopted
these
methods
and
in
the
way
the
army
commanders
incorporated
them
into
their
military
thinking
.

Then
,
in
some
way
,
this
lack
of
faith
in
the
cavalry
became
mixed
up
in
his
mind
with
the
dragging
effect
of
wagon
trains
and
was
hardened
into
a
prejudice
.

Sherman
insisted
that
cavalry
could
not
successfully
break
up
hostile
railways
,
yet
Garrard's
Covington
raid
and
Rousseau's
Opelika
raid
cut
two-thirds
of
the
rail
lines
he
had
to
break
and
Sherman
lived
in
mortal
fear
of
what
Forrest
might
do
to
his
communications
.

It
stumbled
on
infantry
where
no
infantry
should
have
been
and
McPherson's
aggressive
impulse
faded
out
,
overwhelmed
by
fears
of
the
unknown
.

To
relieve
the
itch
and
sweat
galls
,
the
men
got
into
the
water
whenever
they
could
and
since
each
sizable
stream
was
generally
the
dividing
line
between
the
armies
the
pickets
declared
a
private
truce
while
the
men
went
swimming
.

Johnston
believed
that
Sherman
put
his
naked
engineers
into
the
swimming
parties
to
locate
the
various
fords
.

The
result
was
that
I
found
myself
in
the
ridiculous
position
of
having
made
a
formal
engagement
by
letter
for
the
next
week
,
only
two
days
before
my
departure
from
London
.

Luckily
both
women
knew
my
position
and
if
anyone
suffered
in
their
opinion
it
was
not
I
''
.

Some
,
she
knew
,
looked
upon
Thompson
almost
as
a
saint
,
but
others
read
in
``
The
Hound
Of
Heaven
''
what
they
took
to
be
the
confessions
of
a
great
sinner
,
who
,
like
Oscar
Wilde
,
had
--
as
one
pious
writer
later
put
it
--
thrown
himself
``
on
the
swelling
wave
of
every
passion
''
.

For
his
part
,
Thompson
had
explained
in
a
previous
letter
that
there
would
be
nothing
but
an
honorable
friendship
between
Katie
and
himself
.

In
any
case
,
she
told
Thompson
that
she
saw
no
reason
why
he
might
not
see
Katie
again
,
``
now
that
this
frank
explanation
has
been
made
&
no
one
can
misunderstand
''
.

After
Thompson
came
to
London
to
live
,
he
received
a
letter
from
Katie
,
which
was
dated
February
8
,
1897
.

I
am
a
great
deal
at
the
little
children's
Hospital
.

It
is
difficult
to
say
what
Thompson
expected
would
come
of
their
relationship
,
which
had
begun
so
soon
after
his
emotions
had
been
stirred
by
Maggie
Brien
,
but
when
Katie
wrote
on
April
11
,
1900
,
to
tell
him
that
she
was
to
be
married
to
the
Rev.
Godfrey
Burr
,
the
vicar
of
Rushall
in
Staffordshire
,
the
news
evidently
helped
to
deepen
his
discouragement
over
the
failure
of
his
hopes
for
a
new
volume
of
verse
.

Perhaps
Mrs.
Meynell
would
do
me
the
undeserved
kindness
to
keep
my
own
copy
of
the
first
edition
of
my
first
book
,
with
all
its
mementos
of
her
and
the
dear
ones
.

Last
,
not
least
,
there
are
some
poems
which
K.
King
sent
me
(
addressed
to
herself
)
when
I
was
preparing
a
fresh
volume
,
asking
me
to
include
them
.

I
have
not
the
heart
.

Katie
cannot
mind
your
seeing
them
now
;
;

since
my
silence
must
have
ended
when
I
gave
the
purposed
volume
to
you
.

but
this
--
yes
,
terrible
step
I
am
about
to
take
is
lightened
with
an
inundating
joy
by
the
new-found
hope
that
here
,
in
these
poems
,
is
treasure
--
or
at
least
some
measure
of
beauty
,
which
I
did
not
know
of
''
.

Some
of
the
poems
express
a
mood
of
joy
in
a
newly
discovered
love
;
;

In
``
My
Song's
Young
Virgin
Date
''
,
for
example
,
Thompson
wrote
:
``
Yea
,
she
that
had
my
song's
young
virgin
date
Not
now
,
alas
,
that
noble
singular
she
,
I
nobler
hold
,
though
marred
from
her
once
state
,
Than
others
in
their
best
integrity
.

That
she
was
affected
by
his
protestations
seems
obvious
,
but
since
she
was
evidently
a
sensible
young
woman
--
as
well
as
an
outgoing
and
sympathetic
type
--
it
would
seem
that
for
her
the
word
friendship
had
a
far
less
intense
emotional
significance
than
that
which
Thompson
gave
it
.

It
was
,
of
course
,
in
this
drawing
of
the
balance
sheet
of
judgment
that
he
most
clearly
displayed
his
desire
to
do
full
justice
to
an
author
.

Poetry
,
he
said
,
must
be
``
dogmatic
''
:
it
must
not
stoop
to
argue
like
a
``
K.C.
in
cloth-of-gold
''
.

Yet
Davidson
impressed
him
as
a
poet
capable
of
``
sustained
power
,
passion
,
or
beauty
''
,
and
he
cited
specific
passages
to
illustrate
not
only
these
qualities
but
Davidson's
command
of
imagery
as
well
.

There
,
along
the
east
bank
of
the
Southern
Bug
,
opposite
the
hamlet
of
Zhitzhakli
a
few
miles
north
of
the
Black
Sea
,
he
arrived
at
General
Headquarters
of
the
Russian
Army
.

Catherine's
first
war
against
the
Grand
Turk
had
ended
in
1774
with
a
peace
treaty
quite
favorable
to
her
.

As
his
second
in
command
The
Prince
had
Marshal
Repnin
,
one-time
Ambassador
to
Poland
.

Repnin
,
who
had
a
rather
narrow
face
,
longish
nose
,
high
forehead
,
and
arching
brows
,
looked
like
a
quizzical
Mephistopheles
.

Then
there
were
the
distinguished
foreign
volunteers
.

and
General
the
Count
Pallavicini
,
founder
of
the
Austrian
branch
of
that
celebrated
Italian
house
,
a
courtier
Littlepage
could
have
met
at
Madrid
in
December
,
1780
.

Lewis
had
expected
to
report
at
once
to
Jones's
and
Nassau's
naval
command
post
.

Having
done
so
,
he
began
to
experience
all
the
frustrations
of
others
who
attempted
to
get
along
with
Serenissimus
and
do
a
job
at
the
same
time
.

Around
the
billiard
tables
were
always
at
least
a
couple
of
dozen
beribboned
generals
.

The
Prince
took
her
with
him
on
every
tour
around
the
area
,
and
it
was
rumored
he
was
utilizing
her
knowledge
of
Constantinople
as
part
of
his
espionage
network
.

He
had
a
small
mouth
with
deep
furrows
on
either
side
,
a
large
flat
nose
,
and
penetrating
blue
eyes
.

Despising
luxuries
of
any
sort
for
a
soldier
,
he
slept
on
a
pile
of
hay
with
his
cloak
as
blanket
.

in
camp
he
knew
it
won
you
the
affection
of
your
men
.

Underneath
,
he
remained
one
of
the
best-educated
Russians
of
his
day
.

For
those
little
men
with
the
short
whiskers
,
shaven
polls
,
and
top
knots
Suvorov
reserved
a
special
esteem
.

Potemkin
--
as
King
Stanislas
knew
,
and
presently
informed
Littlepage
--
looked
on
the
Cossacks
as
geopolitical
tools
.

To
Serenissimus
such
tribes
as
the
Cossacks
of
the
Don
or
those
ex-bandits
the
Zaporogian
Cossacks
(
in
whose
islands
along
the
lower
Dnieper
the
Polish
novelist
Sienkiewicz
would
one
day
place
With
Fire
And
Sword
)
were
just
elements
for
enforced
resettlement
in
,
say
,
Bessarabia
,
where
,
as
``
the
faithful
of
the
Black
Sea
borders
''
,
he
could
use
their
presence
as
bargaining
points
in
the
Czarina's
territorial
claims
against
Turkey
.

He
often
donned
their
tribal
costumes
,
such
as
the
one
featuring
a
tall
,
black
sheepskin
hat
from
the
top
of
which
dangled
a
little
red
bag
ornamented
by
a
chain
of
worsted
lace
and
tassels
;
;

``
Transparent
look
,
waxy
skin
--
could
well
be
uremia
''
.

The
little
official
hung
his
head
in
shame
.

I
might
not
make
any
money
but
I'd
sure
have
patients
''
.

After
luncheon
we
took
advantage
of
the
siesta
period
to
try
to
get
in
touch
with
a
few
people
to
whom
our
dear
friend
Deppy
had
written
.

``
All
you
have
to
do
,
Ilka
dear
,
is
to
phone
on
your
arrival
.

They
are
longing
to
see
you
''
.

The
wear
and
tear
of
life
have
taught
me
that
very
few
friends
of
mutual
friends
long
to
see
foreign
strangers
,
but
I
planned
on
being
the
soul
of
tact
,
of
giving
them
plenty
of
outs
was
there
the
tiniest
implication
that
their
cups
were
already
running
over
without
us
.

Will
it
live
up
to
its
reputation
?
?

It
is
awe-inspiring
.

We
saw
it
frequently
afterward
,
but
our
suggestion
for
the
very
first
encounter
is
near
sunset
.

Nearby
is
the
temple
of
Athena
.

Furthermore
I
can
identify
each
design
.

Gun
on
shoulder
,
he
would
march
smartly
for
a
few
yards
,
bring
his
heels
together
with
a
click
,
make
a
brisk
pirouette
,
skirts
flaring
,
and
march
back
to
his
point
of
departure
.

On
the
way
out
Mr.
Sakellariadis
detoured
up
a
special
hill
from
which
one
may
obtain
a
matchless
view
of
the
Acropolis
lighted
by
night
.

These
performances
were
being
staged
at
historical
monuments
throughout
Europe
.

Nine
o'clock
is
the
rush
hour
,
when
the
busses
are
jammed
,
and
by
nine-thirty
the
restaurants
are
beginning
to
fill
.

Although
open
to
the
general
public
it
is
not
overcrowded
;
;

the
atmosphere
is
that
of
an
attractive
private
beach
club
at
home
.

One
is
Greece
is
not
yet
suffering
from
overpopulation
.

We
were
struck
by
the
notable
absence
of
banana
skins
and
beer
cans
,
but
just
so
that
we
wouldn't
go
overboard
on
Greek
refinement
,
perfection
was
side-stepped
by
a
couple
of
braying
portable
radios
.

Greek
boys
and
girls
also
go
for
rock-and-roll
,
and
the
stations
most
tuned
to
are
those
carrying
United
States
overseas
programs
.

Gaunt
scaffoldings
adjoined
the
ruins
,
and
on
the
ground
segments
of
columns
two
and
a
half
to
three
feet
in
thickness
were
being
fitted
with
sections
cunningly
chiseled
to
match
exactly
the
fluting
and
proportion
of
the
original
.

This
restaurant
,
too
,
had
a
cat
,
a
dusty
,
thin
little
creature
.

How
can
a
cat
be
thin
in
a
fish
restaurant
?
?

When
offered
a
morsel
it
glanced
right
and
left
and
winced
,
obviously
frightened
and
expecting
a
kick
,
but
too
hungry
not
to
snatch
the
tidbit
.

They
would
be
lolling
under
a
tree
sipping
Ouzo
,
relishing
the
leisurely
life
,
assuring
him
that
the
day
was
yet
young
.

--
But
let
him
be
ready
to
invent
whatever
falsehood
--
to
assail
whatever
character
--
and
to
prostitute
his
paper
to
whatever
ends
--
and
they
hug
him
to
their
heart
.

To
exonerate
the
legislature
and
thereby
extricate
himself
from
a
sticky
situation
,
Pike
took
another
course
and
made
it
appear
that
the
legislature
had
been
bilked
.

Over
the
months
he
became
a
political
gadfly
with
an
incessant
barrage
of
satirical
poems
ridiculing
Woodruff
,
the
``
Casca
''
letters
belittling
Woodruff
,
and
long
analytical
articles
vilifying
Woodruff
.

By
this
time
Woodruff
had
accurately
measured
Pike
as
a
man
of
great
personal
pride
,
a
man
who
would
fly
into
a
towering
rage
if
his
integrity
were
questioned
,
and
who
would
be
anxious
to
avenge
himself
.

Pike
was
stunned
by
the
first
blast
against
his
character
,
which
was
published
in
the
March
4th
issue
of
The
Gazette
under
the
name
``
Vale
''
.

He
said
Pike
had
stolen
mules
from
Harris
during
the
Santa
Fe
expedition
;
;

Without
further
inquiry
,
Pike
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
Robinson
was
guilty
,
and
,
following
the
honorable
route
that
would
eventually
lead
to
the
dueling
ground
,
sent
a
message
to
Robinson
through
his
friends
,
demanding
that
he
either
confirm
or
deny
his
complicity
.

As
summer
cooled
into
fall
and
winter
,
even
so
the
relationship
between
the
two
men
continued
to
grow
colder
by
the
day
,
and
by
December
of
1834
it
was
icy
.

It
was
at
this
point
that
Pike
decided
to
capitalize
on
the
bad
feelings
between
the
two
men
.

The
governor
was
not
used
to
having
his
integrity
questioned
,
and
he
promptly
passed
the
charges
on
to
Woodruff
,
demanding
that
Woodruff
answer
them
.

If
Woodruff
could
not
furnish
a
strong
explanation
,
the
governor
insisted
that
he
lower
his
prices
in
accord
with
the
scale
printed
in
The
Advocate
.

Woodruff
was
now
impaled
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
.

``
Little
Rock
is
,
without
any
flattery
,
one
of
the
dullest
towns
in
the
United
States
and
I
would
not
have
remained
two
hours
in
the
place
,
if
I
had
not
met
with
some
good
friends
who
made
me
forget
its
dreariness
''
.

Very
soon
after
his
arrival
in
Little
Rock
,
Pike
had
joined
one
of
the
most
influential
organizations
in
town
,
the
Little
Rock
Debating
Society
,
and
it
was
with
this
group
that
he
made
his
debut
as
an
orator
,
being
invited
to
deliver
the
annual
Fourth
of
July
address
the
club
sponsored
every
year
.

His
contemporaries
in
Massachusetts
called
him
an
arch-heretic
,
a
beast
,
a
miscreant
,
a
proud
and
pestilent
seducer
,
a
prodigious
minter
of
exorbitant
novelties
.

He
was
universally
beloved
by
his
neighbours
,
and
the
Indians
,
who
esteemed
him
,
not
only
as
a
friend
,
but
one
high
in
communion
with
God
in
Heaven
''
.

He
worked
as
a
``
clothier
''
in
London
,
but
was
greatly
concerned
with
religion
.

Roger
Williams
had
recently
been
thrown
out
,
and
Anne
Hutchinson
and
her
Antinomians
were
slugging
it
out
with
the
powers-that-be
.

She
was
Ellen
Aldridge
,
a
widow
of
good
repute
who
was
employed
by
Gorton's
wife
and
lived
with
the
family
.

He
advised
the
poor
woman
not
to
appear
in
court
as
what
she
was
charged
with
was
not
in
violation
of
law
.

One
can
imagine
that
with
her
and
Gorton
there
it
was
no
place
for
anyone
with
weak
nerves
.

Roger
Williams
wrote
his
friend
Winthrop
as
follows
:
``

yet
the
tide
is
too
strong
against
us
,
and
I
fear
(
if
the
framer
of
hearts
help
not
)
it
will
force
me
to
little
Patience
,
a
little
isle
next
to
your
Prudence
''
.

This
town
should
not
be
confused
with
Pawtucket
,
just
north
of
Providence
,
or
Pawcatuck
,
Connecticut
,
on
the
Pawcatuck
River
,
opposite
Westerly
,
Rhode
Island
.

Upon
intelligence
that
the
formidable
agitator
was
to
favor
them
with
his
presence
,
the
benighted
inhabitants
of
Pawtuxet
,
alas
,
gave
their
allegiance
to
Massachusetts
and
asked
that
colony
to
expel
the
newcomers
.

Gorton
and
company
,
however
,
promptly
bought
land
from
Miantonomi
a
few
miles
south
of
Pawtuxet
,
extending
from
the
present
Gaspee
Point
south
to
Warwick
Neck
and
twenty
miles
inland
.

It
was
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
anybody
or
anything
,
including
Providence
and
Massachusetts
.

The
purchasers
rejected
the
order
in
two
letters
written
in
vigorous
terms
.

The
next
week
,
forty
soldiers
were
sent
to
get
the
miscreants
.

The
attackers
sent
for
more
soldiers
,
and
the
defenders
,
to
save
bloodshed
,
surrendered
under
the
promise
that
they
would
be
treated
as
neighbors
.

Promptly
their
livestock
was
taken
and
according
to
Gorton
the
soldiers
were
ordered
to
knock
down
anyone
who
should
utter
a
word
of
insolence
,
and
run
through
anyone
who
might
step
out
of
line
.

The
magistrates
were
determined
to
compel
them
.

Reverend
Cotton
preached
to
them
about
Demetrius
and
the
shrines
of
Ephesus
.

At
the
trial
which
took
place
later
,
the
Pomham
matter
was
completely
omitted
.

Gorton
answered
in
writing
.

``
I've
been
cooped
up
so
long
''
,
he
added
.

That
was
in
the
days
before
blood
banks
,
of
course
,
and
transfusions
had
to
be
given
directly
from
donor
to
patient
.

One
had
to
find
a
donor
,
and
usually
very
quickly
,
whose
blood
corresponded
with
the
patient's
.

They
had
to
take
blood
samples
to
the
laboratory
to
test
them
,
for
one
thing
,
and
there
was
much
required
preliminary
procedure
.

He's
past
helping
.

The
date
was
June
20
,
1922
.

A
few
years
before
his
death
Papa
had
agreed
with
Mama
to
make
a
joint
will
with
her
in
which
it
would
be
provided
that
in
the
event
of
the
death
of
either
of
them
an
accounting
would
be
made
to
their
children
whereby
each
child
would
receive
a
bequest
of
$5000
cash
.

This
,
manifestly
,
would
not
provide
$5000
to
each
of
the
surviving
five
children
.

Consequently
,
Fred
and
Tom
,
the
two
who
had
been
provided
college
educations
,
signed
statements
to
the
effect
that
each
had
received
his
bequest
in
full
,
and
Effie
and
I
were
each
allotted
$5000
.

But
he
had
succeeded
well
,
we
agreed
.

That
third
year
he
wrote
plays
with
a
fury
.

Later
this
play
would
be
called
Welcome
To
Our
City
.

That
spring
Welcome
To
Our
City
was
selected
for
production
by
the
47
Workshop
and
it
was
staged
in
the
middle
of
May
.

It
ran
two
nights
,
and
though
it
was
generally
praised
,
there
was
considerable
criticism
of
its
length
.

he
wanted
nothing
compressed
,
tight
.

he
despised
parsimony
,
and
particularly
of
words
.

That
summer
Tom
attended
the
summer
session
at
Harvard
,
but
he
did
not
ask
Mama
to
send
him
back
in
the
fall
.

The
Graham
Memorial
would
be
the
campus
student
union
honoring
the
late
and
much
beloved
Edward
Kidder
Graham
,
who
had
been
president
when
Tom
entered
the
university
.

But
they
would
reconsider
it
,
they
assured
him
,
if
he
would
rewrite
it
.

This
man
,
Tom
said
,
had
the
play
shut
up
in
his
desk
,
I
believe
,
and
when
Tom
sat
down
,
he
pulled
it
out
and
apologetically
told
Tom
that
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
use
it
.

It
was
not
until
we
had
returned
to
the
city
to
live
,
while
I
was
still
at
Brown
and
Sharpe's
,
that
I
felt
the
full
impact
of
evangelical
Christianity
.

This
group
in
Park
Place
Church
was
made
up
of
the
earnest
few
.

Besides
Church
and
Sunday
School
I
went
to
out-of-door
meetings
on
the
sidewalk
at
the
church
door
.

I
went
to
an
afternoon
service
at
the
Aj
.

Try
as
I
might
to
confess
my
sins
and
accept
salvation
,
no
answer
came
to
me
from
heaven
.

In
the
rhyming
catechism
this
doctrine
is
worded
thus
:
``
In
Adam's
fall
We
sin-ned
all
''
.

The
actual
impelling
force
which
severed
me
from
evangelical
effort
was
of
another
sort
.

From
that
time
to
this
my
religious
concern
is
that
I
might
give
effective
help
to
the
bringing
in
of
God's
kingdom
on
earth
.

Their
basis
seems
deeper
than
mere
authority
.

Because
God
is
what
He
is
,
the
laws
of
the
universe
,
material
and
spiritual
,
are
what
they
are
.

One's
daily
work
becomes
sacred
,
since
it
is
performed
in
the
field
of
influence
of
the
moral
law
,
dealing
as
it
does
with
people
as
well
as
with
matter
and
energy
.

In
his
book
Civilization
And
Ethics
Albert
Schweitzer
faces
the
moral
problems
which
arise
when
moral
law
is
recognized
in
business
life
,
for
example
.

Schweitzer
seems
,
in
fact
,
to
acquire
for
himself
a
burden
of
sin
,
not
bequeathed
by
Adam
,
but
accumulated
in
the
inevitable
judgments
which
life
requires
of
him
as
between
greater
and
lesser
responsibilities
.

Perhaps
it
should
have
.

Neither
the
engineer
nor
the
ordinary
citizen
feels
any
self-consciousness
in
obeying
the
laws
of
matter
and
energy
,
nor
can
he
achieve
a
sense
of
self-righteousness
in
such
obedience
.

There
is
indeed
a
moral
responsibility
on
man
himself
,
for
his
own
soul's
sake
,
to
respect
lower
life
and
to
avoid
the
infliction
of
suffering
,
but
this
viewpoint
Schweitzer
rejects
.

Persons
,
whether
white
,
black
,
brown
or
yellow
,
are
a
concern
of
God
.

Respect
for
personality
is
a
privilege
and
a
duty
for
us
as
brothers
.

With
the
knowledge
that
the
kingdom
comes
by
obedience
to
the
moral
law
in
our
relations
with
all
people
,
we
have
a
firm
intellectual
grasp
on
both
the
means
and
the
ends
of
our
lives
.

I
asked
one
day
what
he
was
doing
.

He
told
me
that
he
had
a
big
newt
and
a
little
newt
and
that
he
was
transplanting
a
big
eye
of
the
big
newt
onto
the
little
newt
and
a
little
eye
of
the
little
newt
onto
the
big
newt
.

Then
I
asked
,
``
What
does
that
teach
you
''
?
?

In
the
face
of
the
unfolding
universe
,
our
ultimate
attitude
is
that
of
wonder
.

None
of
these
discoveries
were
neatly
rounded
off
bits
of
knowledge
.

Each
faded
out
into
the
unexplored
areas
of
the
future
.

Criticism
is
as
old
as
literary
art
and
we
can
set
the
stage
for
our
study
of
three
moderns
if
we
see
how
certain
critics
in
the
past
have
dealt
with
the
ethical
aspects
of
literature
.

Such
a
list
must
naturally
be
selective
,
and
the
treatment
of
each
man
is
brief
,
for
I
am
interested
only
in
their
general
ideas
on
the
moral
measure
of
literature
.

And
most
of
the
great
periods
are
represented
,
because
we
will
compare
Plato
and
Aristotle
from
the
golden
age
of
Greece
;
;

When
he
discusses
tyrants
in
the
Eighth
Book
of
The
Republic
,
he
pictures
the
poets
as
willing
to
praise
the
worst
rulers
.

But
the
most
fundamental
objection
he
has
to
poets
appears
in
the
Tenth
Book
,
and
it
is
derived
from
his
doctrine
of
ideal
forms
.

and
poetry
,
with
all
its
emphasis
on
the
passions
,
encourages
the
audience
to
give
way
to
emotion
.

For
this
reason
,
then
,
poetry
tends
to
weaken
the
power
of
control
,
the
reason
,
because
it
tempts
one
to
indulge
his
passions
,
and
even
the
best
of
men
,
he
maintains
,
may
be
corrupted
by
this
subtle
influence
.

Plato's
attitude
toward
poetry
has
always
been
something
of
an
enigma
,
because
he
is
so
completely
sensitive
to
its
charm
.

He
even
calls
upon
the
poets
to
defend
the
Muse
and
to
show
that
poetry
may
contribute
to
virtue
.

We
may
further
grant
to
those
of
her
(
Poetry's
)
defenders
who
are
lovers
of
poetry
and
yet
not
poets
,
the
permission
to
speak
in
prose
on
her
behalf
:
let
them
show
not
only
that
she
is
pleasant
but
also
useful
to
States
and
to
human
life
,
and
we
will
listen
in
a
kindly
spirit
;
;

Throughout
the
rest
of
the
Poetics
,
Aristotle
continues
to
discuss
the
characteristics
of
these
six
parts
and
their
interrelationship
,
and
he
refers
frequently
to
the
standards
suggested
by
his
definition
of
tragedy
.

But
there
are
,
however
,
several
features
of
Aristotle's
approach
which
open
the
way
for
the
moral
measure
of
literature
.

He
rejects
certain
plots
because
they
do
not
contribute
to
that
end
.

It
may
allay
our
passions
and
so
restore
the
rule
of
reason
.

Both
sides
claimed
that
Plato
and
Aristotle
supported
their
cause
.

For
this
reason
,
then
I
want
to
describe
,
first
,
two
examples
of
the
puritanical
attacks
:
Stephen
Gosson's
The
School
Of
Abuse
,
1579
,
and
his
later
Playes
Confuted
,
published
in
1582
.

Although
this
kind
of
wholesale
objection
came
at
first
from
some
men
who
were
not
technically
Puritans
,
still
,
once
the
Puritans
gained
power
,
they
climaxed
the
affair
by
passing
the
infamous
ordinance
of
1642
which
decreed
that
all
``
public
stage-plays
shall
cease
and
be
forborne
''
.

With
that
act
of
Parliament
the
opponents
of
the
stage
won
the
day
,
and
for
more
than
two
decades
after
that
England
had
no
legitimate
public
drama
.

For
this
purpose
we
now
draw
upon
data
from
sociological
and
psychological
studies
of
students
in
American
colleges
and
universities
,
and
particularly
from
the
Cornell
Values
Studies
.

In
the
latter
research
program
,
information
is
available
for
2,758
Cornell
students
surveyed
in
1950
and
for
1,571
students
surveyed
in
1952
.

Of
the
latter
sample
,
944
persons
had
been
studied
two
years
earlier
;
;

Other
conceivable
goals
,
such
as
character-education
and
social
adjustment
,
are
of
secondary
importance
to
them
.

In
the
university
milieu
of
scholarship
and
research
,
of
social
diversity
,
of
new
ideas
and
varied
and
wide-ranging
interests
,
``
socialization
''
into
a
campus
culture
apparently
means
heightened
appreciation
of
the
idea
of
a
liberal
education
in
the
arts
and
sciences
.

There
is
impressive
consistency
between
specific
occupational
preferences
and
the
student's
basic
conception
of
what
is
for
him
a
good
way
of
life
.

The
purely
cognitive
or
informational
problems
are
often
acute
.

many
a
people-oriented
student
who
dreams
of
the
M.D.
decides
to
enter
his
father's
advertising
agency
;
;

The
old
ideal
of
the
independent
entrepreneur
is
extant
--
but
so
is
the
recognition
that
the
main
chance
may
be
in
a
corporate
bureaucracy
.

``
Conservatism
''
and
``
traditionalism
''
seem
implied
by
what
has
just
been
said
.

In
the
field
of
political
values
,
it
is
certainly
true
that
students
are
not
radical
,
not
rebels
against
their
parents
or
their
peers
.

To
the
extent
that
our
sampling
of
the
orientations
of
American
college
students
in
the
years
1950
and
1952
may
be
representative
of
our
culture
--
and
still
valid
in
1959
--
we
are
disposed
to
question
the
summary
characterization
of
the
current
generation
as
silent
,
beat
,
apathetic
,
or
as
a
mass
of
other-directed
conformists
who
are
guided
solely
by
social
radar
without
benefit
of
inner
gyroscopes
.

As
they
move
through
the
college
years
our
young
men
and
women
are
``
socialized
''
into
a
broadly
similar
culture
,
at
the
level
of
personal
behavior
.

Their
commitments
are
,
for
the
most
part
,
couched
in
a
familiar
idiom
.

Avowed
atheists
or
freethinkers
are
so
rare
as
to
be
a
curiosity
.

The
religious
quest
is
often
intense
and
deep
,
and
there
are
students
on
every
campus
who
are
seriously
wrestling
with
the
most
profound
questions
of
meaning
and
value
.

Still
another
segment
of
the
student
population
consists
of
those
who
seek
,
in
what
they
regard
as
religion
,
intellectual
clarity
,
rational
belief
,
and
ethical
guidance
and
reinforcement
.

Upon
second
thought
we
were
forced
to
realize
that
we
have
very
few
reliable
historical
benchmarks
against
which
we
might
compare
the
present
situation
,
and
that
conclusions
that
present-day
students
are
``
more
''
or
``
less
''
religious
could
not
be
defended
on
the
basis
of
our
data
.

Morgan
himself
had
sciatica
again
.

Even
on
his
tough
constitution
,
the
exposure
and
strenuous
activity
were
beginning
to
tell
in
earnest
.

A
body
of
redcoats
were
seen
marching
down
a
nearby
slope
,
a
tempting
target
for
the
riflemen
,
who
threw
a
volley
into
their
ranks
and
``
messed
up
''
the
smart
formation
considerably
.

But
the
Maryland
militia
had
likewise
fled
,
all
too
typical
of
this
type
of
soldier
during
the
Revolution
,
an
experience
which
gave
Morgan
little
confidence
in
militia
in
general
,
as
he
watched
other
instances
of
their
breaking
in
hot
engagements
.

But
you
could
(
as
from
yourself
)
tell
her
that
you
had
friends
who
,
being
with
the
army
,
don't
know
what
to
do
with
their
money
and
would
willingly
let
her
have
one
or
many
thousand
dollars
''
.

Richard
Peters
,
Secretary
of
the
Board
of
War
,
thought
Morgan
was
so
extreme
on
the
subject
that
he
accused
him
of
trying
to
pick
a
quarrel
.

Morgan
took
charge
of
the
furniture
and
restored
it
to
its
thankful
owners
,
but
he
let
the
culprits
who
had
stolen
it
go
free
.

Daniel
Morgan's
rheumatic
condition
worsened
with
the
increase
of
the
cold
and
damp
weather
.

The
mild
activity
of
his
command
during
the
sojourn
of
the
troops
at
Valley
Forge
could
be
handled
by
a
subordinate
,
he
felt
,
so
like
Henry
Knox
,
equally
loyal
to
Washington
,
who
went
to
Boston
at
this
time
,
Morgan
received
permission
to
visit
his
home
in
Virginia
for
several
weeks
.

It
is
doubtful
if
Morgan
was
able
to
take
home
much
money
to
his
wife
and
children
,
for
his
pay
,
as
shown
by
the
War
Department
Abstracts
of
early
1778
was
$75
a
month
as
a
colonel
,
and
that
apt
to
be
delayed
.

His
neighbors
celebrated
his
return
,
even
if
it
was
only
temporary
,
and
Morgan
was
especially
gratified
by
the
quaint
expression
of
an
elderly
friend
,
Isaac
Lane
,
who
told
him
,
``
A
man
that
has
so
often
left
all
that
is
dear
to
him
,
as
thou
hast
,
to
serve
thy
country
,
must
create
a
sympathetic
feeling
in
every
patriotic
heart
''
.

There
must
have
been
special
feelings
of
joy
and
patriotism
in
the
heart
of
Daniel
Morgan
too
,
when
the
news
was
received
on
April
30th
of
the
recognition
by
France
of
the
independence
of
the
United
States
.

The
dreary
camp
at
Valley
Forge
was
turned
into
an
arena
of
rejoicing
.

Even
the
dignified
Washington
indulged
in
a
game
of
wickets
with
some
children
.

``
The
reason
for
this
''
,
the
orders
said
,
``
is
that
the
enemy
may
think
to
take
advantage
of
the
celebration
of
this
day
.

Apparently
no
serious
disorders
resulted
from
the
celebration
,
and
within
a
few
days
,
Morgan
joined
the
force
of
Lafayette
who
now
had
command
of
some
2,000
men
at
Barren
Hill
,
not
far
above
Philadelphia
on
the
Schuylkill
.

Colonel
Benjamin
Ford
wrote
to
Morgan
from
Wilmington
that
he
understood
a
Mrs.
Sanderson
from
Maryland
had
obtained
permission
from
Smallwood
to
visit
Philadelphia
,
and
would
return
on
May
26th
,
escorted
by
several
officers
from
Maryland
``
belonging
to
the
new
levies
in
the
British
service
''
.

For
by
now
the
original
cause
of
the
quarrel
,
Philip's
seizure
of
Gascony
,
was
only
one
strand
in
the
spider
web
of
French
interests
that
overlay
all
western
Europe
and
that
had
been
so
well
and
closely
spun
that
the
lightest
movement
could
set
it
trembling
from
one
end
to
the
other
.

Nogaret
is
hardly
an
impartial
witness
,
and
even
he
did
not
make
his
charges
against
Boniface
until
the
latter
was
dead
,
but
there
is
some
truth
in
what
he
said
and
more
in
what
he
did
not
say
.

the
pope
was
playing
a
dangerous
game
,
with
so
many
balls
in
the
air
at
once
that
a
misstep
would
bring
them
all
about
his
ears
,
and
his
only
hope
was
to
temporize
so
that
he
could
take
advantage
of
every
change
in
the
delicate
balance
of
European
affairs
.

When
the
negotiations
began
,
his
quarrel
with
the
king
of
France
was
temporarily
in
abeyance
,
and
he
had
no
intention
of
reviving
it
so
long
as
there
was
hope
that
French
money
would
come
to
pay
the
troops
who
,
under
Charles
of
Valois
,
the
papal
vicar
of
Tuscany
,
were
so
valuable
in
the
crusade
against
the
Colonna
cardinals
and
their
Sicilian
allies
.

The
French
were
now
occupying
Gascony
and
Flanders
on
the
technical
grounds
that
their
rulers
had
forfeited
them
by
a
breach
of
the
feudal
contract
.

This
was
Boniface's
monumental
tactlessness
.

He
was
a
learned
and
brilliant
man
,
one
of
the
best
jurists
in
Europe
and
with
flashes
of
penetrating
insight
,
and
yet
in
his
dealings
with
other
people
,
particularly
when
he
tried
to
be
ingratiating
,
he
was
capable
of
an
abysmal
stupidity
that
can
have
come
only
from
a
complete
incomprehension
of
human
nature
and
human
motives
.

This
lofty
disregard
for
others
was
not
shared
by
such
men
as
Pierre
Flotte
and
his
associates
,
that
``
brilliant
group
of
mediocre
men
''
,
as
Powicke
calls
them
,
who
provided
the
brains
for
the
French
embassy
that
came
to
Rome
under
the
nominal
leadership
of
the
archbishop
of
Narbonne
,
the
duke
of
Burgundy
,
and
the
count
of
St.-Pol
.

And
yet
he
made
no
pretense
about
it
;
;

The
Frenchman's
answer
was
a
terse
``
Vous
dites
vrai
''
.

The
defeat
and
death
of
Adolf
of
Nassau
at
the
hands
of
Albert
of
Habsburg
also
worked
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
English
,
for
all
the
efforts
to
revive
the
anti-French
coalition
came
to
nothing
when
Philip
made
an
alliance
with
the
new
king
of
the
Romans
.

In
spite
of
the
armistice
negotiated
by
Amadee
two
years
earlier
,
the
war
between
Bishop
Guillaume
of
Lausanne
and
Louis
of
Savoy
was
still
going
on
,
and
although
little
is
known
about
it
,
that
little
proves
that
it
was
yet
another
phase
of
the
struggle
against
French
expansion
and
was
closely
interwoven
with
the
larger
conflict
.

But
although
in
many
of
these
discussions
Othon
and
Amadee
might
have
been
tempted
to
consider
their
own
interests
as
well
as
those
of
the
king
,
Edward's
confidence
in
them
was
so
absolute
that
they
were
made
the
acknowledged
leaders
of
the
embassy
.

The
younger
men
,
Vere
,
and
Pembroke
,
who
was
also
Edward's
cousin
and
whose
Lusignan
blood
gave
him
the
swarthy
complexion
that
caused
Edward
of
Carnarvon's
irreverent
friend
,
Piers
Gaveston
,
to
nickname
him
``
Joseph
the
Jew
''
,
were
relatively
new
to
the
game
of
diplomacy
,
but
Pontissara
had
been
on
missions
to
Rome
before
,
and
Hotham
,
a
man
of
great
learning
,
``
jocund
in
speech
,
agreeable
to
meet
,
of
honest
religion
,
and
pleasing
in
the
eyes
of
all
''
,
and
an
archbishop
to
boot
,
was
as
reliable
and
experienced
as
Othon
himself
.

A
northern
ambassador
,
willing
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
and
his
ears
open
,
could
learn
a
lot
that
would
stand
him
in
good
stead
at
the
Curia
.

My
father
would
have
done
it
if
it
hadn't
been
for
my
mother
,
who
had
a
fear
of
being
in
debt
to
anyone
--
even
Alfred
Alpert
.

In
spite
of
his
being
well
liked
there
were
a
few
people
who
were
very
careful
about
Alfred
.

The
six
miles
between
the
towns
became
an
ocean
and
the
Alperts
became
a
family
of
strangers
.

It
was
in
the
spring
of
the
year
when
he
took
to
his
bed
and
Tessie
and
Alfred
found
out
that
they
didn't
know
each
other
.

They
were
like
two
strangers
.

And
when
Alfred
was
forced
into
his
bed
,
Tessie
left
the
front
porch
of
the
store
and
sat
at
home
,
rocking
in
her
rocker
in
the
living
room
,
staring
out
the
window
--
the
rose
still
in
her
hair
.

He
knew
Alfred
liked
me
;
;

He
didn't
want
Alfred
to
leave
me
trouble
because
that's
all
it
would
be
,
and
Alfred
understood
.

I
could
hear
Alfred's
voice
a
few
words
behind
Meltzer's
like
a
counterpoint
,
punctuated
by
sobs
of
sorrow
and
resignation
.

Alfred
nodded
a
little
nod
and
went
out
through
the
door
.

Alfred
walked
past
him
without
a
word
and
got
into
the
car
.

Harry
ran
to
the
side
of
the
car
where
Alfred
was
sitting
and
looked
at
him
,
begging
him
to
speak
.

Alfred
looked
straight
ahead
.

Alfred
!
!

He
stood
there
watching
until
it
had
gone
from
his
sight
.

I
don't
think
he
ever
got
to
drink
any
of
it
.

The
jug
stayed
at
the
hospital
and
the
water
--
what
can
happen
to
water
?
?

12
``
where
is
it
written
''
?
?

He
came
to
Fleischmanns
directly
from
the
boat
that
brought
him
to
America
from
Russia
.

The
daughter
,
Lilly
,
was
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
and
I
always
had
hopes
that
someday
she
and
Meltzer
would
find
each
other
.

He
treated
both
with
equal
indifference
and
with
equal
contempt
;
;

Lilly
Banks
and
I
became
friends
.

I
helped
Lilly
in
the
store
.

Lilly
preferred
the
loneliness
of
that
walk
.

We
were
almost
the
same
age
,
she
was
fifteen
,
I
was
twelve
,
and
where
I
felt
there
was
a
life
to
look
forward
to
Lilly
felt
she
had
had
as
much
of
it
as
was
necessary
.

Karl
was
an
almost
exact
copy
of
his
father
physically
and
it
was
strange
to
see
the
expected
become
the
unexpected
.

And
even
hearing
it
in
a
concert
hall
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
people
the
words
and
the
melody
would
make
me
a
little
colder
and
I
would
reach
out
for
my
husband's
hand
.

The
brother
and
sister
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
mutual-aid
society
,
a
little
fortress
of
kindness
for
each
other
in
a
hard
world
.

At
the
bottom
of
this
change
were
great
strides
forward
in
the
technical
equipment
and
technical
standards
of
the
historian
.

The
value
of
place-names
in
the
reconstruction
of
early
English
history
had
long
been
recognized
.

Even
in
the
nineteenth
century
such
accomplished
philologists
as
Kemble
and
Guest
were
led
into
what
now
seem
ludicrous
errors
because
of
their
failure
to
recognize
that
modern
forms
of
place
names
are
not
necessarily
the
result
of
logical
philological
development
.

Following
him
in
varying
degrees
of
scepticism
were
T.W.
Shore
,
H.M.
Chadwick
,
Thomas
Hodgkin
and
F.
G.
Beck
.

By
1913
,
Ferdinand
Lot
could
begin
an
article
subtitled
``
La
Conquete
De
La
Grande-Bretagne
par
Les
Saxons
''
with
the
words
,
``
Il
est
difficile
aujourd'hui
d'entretenir
des
illusions
sur
la
valeur
du
recit
traditionnel
de
la
conquete
de
la
Grande-Bretagne
.

Most
now
admit
that
Bede
,
Gildas
,
Nennius
and
The
Anglo-Saxon
Chronicles
cannot
be
the
infallible
guides
to
early
English
history
that
Guest
,
Freeman
and
Green
thought
them
to
be
.

As
R.H.
Hodgkin
has
remarked
:
``
The
critical
methods
of
the
nineteenth
century
shattered
most
of
this
picturesque
narrative
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
consensus
of
opinion
is
that
,
used
with
caution
and
in
conjunction
with
other
types
of
evidence
,
the
native
sources
still
provide
a
valid
rough
outline
for
the
English
settlement
of
southern
Britain
.

Nevertheless
,
in
another
way
modern
historians
still
labor
in
the
vineyard
of
the
Oxford
school
.

At
this
point
,
of
course
,
the
issue
has
become
complicated
by
a
development
unforeseen
by
Lappenberg
and
Kemble
.

In
the
main
stream
of
historical
thinking
is
a
group
of
scholars
,
H.M.
Chadwick
,
R.H.
Hodgkin
,
Sir
Frank
Stenton
et
al.
who
are
in
varying
degrees
sceptical
of
the
native
traditions
of
the
conquest
but
who
defend
the
catastrophic
type
of
invasion
suggested
by
them
.

Those
who
do
have
occasion
to
deal
with
the
invasions
in
a
more
general
way
,
like
T.W.
Shore
and
Arthur
Wade-Evans
,
are
on
the
side
of
a
gradual
and
often
peaceful
Germanic
penetration
into
Britain
.

Again
omitting
recent
developments
,
E.T.
Leeds'
dictum
of
1913
has
stood
unchallenged
:
``
So
far
as
archaeology
is
concerned
,
there
is
not
the
least
warrant
for
the
second
(
shore
occupied
by
)
of
these
theories
''
.

We
must
,
therefore
,
have
a
look
at
the
new
archaeological
material
and
re-examine
the
literary
and
place-name
evidence
which
bears
upon
the
problem
.

What
exactly
are
we
trying
to
prove
?
?

My
argument
is
that
there
was
no
Saxon
Shore
prior
to
that
time
even
though
the
forts
had
been
in
existence
since
the
time
of
Carausius
.

The
problem
,
in
other
words
,
is
strictly
a
chronological
one
.

It
is
a
matter
of
trying
to
sort
out
an
earlier
fourth-century
Saxon
element
from
the
later
,
fifth-century
mainstream
of
Anglo-Saxon
invasions
.

namely
,
is
the
idea
that
there
were
Saxon
mercenaries
in
England
at
all
reasonable
?
?

Wood
took
the
proposal
to
Chief
of
Staff
Hugh
L.
Scott
,
who
passed
it
on
to
Baker
a
month
before
the
actual
declaration
of
war
against
Germany
.

It
was
Baker
,
working
through
Provost
Marshal
Enoch
Crowder
and
Major
Hugh
S.
(
``
Old
Ironpants
''
)
Johnson
,
who
arranged
for
a
secret
printing
by
the
million
of
selective
service
blanks
--
again
before
the
Act
was
passed
--
until
corridors
in
the
Government
Printing
Office
were
full
and
the
basement
of
the
Washington
Post
Office
was
stacked
to
the
ceiling
.

Even
so
,
the
Draft
Act
encountered
rough
sledding
in
its
progress
through
the
Congress
.

He
was
the
first
of
2,800,000
called
to
the
Army
through
the
selective
service
system
.

At
Camp
Taylor
in
Kentucky
a
barracks
was
built
in
an
hour
and
a
half
from
timber
that
had
been
standing
in
Mississippi
forests
one
week
before
.

The
total
operation
was
a
construction
project
comparable
in
magnitude
with
the
Panama
Canal
,
but
in
1917
time
was
in
short
supply
;
;

This
enviable
record
would
have
been
maintained
but
for
a
great
and
unexpected
disaster
which
struck
the
world
with
murderous
stealth
.

In
mid-September
1918
,
the
influenza-pneumonia
pandemic
swept
through
every
American
military
camp
;
;

In
spite
of
this
catastrophe
the
final
mortality
figure
from
disease
in
the
American
Army
during
World
War
1
,
was
15
per
1,000
per
year
,
contrasted
with
110
per
1,000
per
year
in
the
Mexican
War
,
and
65
in
the
American
Civil
War
.

six
days
after
war
was
declared
he
appointed
Raymond
Fosdick
chairman
of
the
Commission
on
Training
Camp
Activities
(
the
CTCA
)
.

On
the
basis
of
the
long
chronicle
of
military
history
Funston
and
his
brethren
assumed
that
the
issue
was
insoluble
and
that
anyone
interested
in
a
mission
like
Fosdick's
was
an
impractical
idealist
or
a
do-gooder
.

During
the
brief
Mexican
venture
Fosdick's
report
to
the
Secretary
recommended
a
definite
stand
by
the
War
Department
against
the
saloon
and
the
excesses
of
prostitution
.

Both
knew
that
when
trains
stopped
at
Texan
crossroads
bored
soldiers
would
sometimes
enter
to
ask
the
passengers
if
they
had
any
reading
material
to
spare
,
even
a
newspaper
.

This
was
the
negative
side
of
the
situation
.

Under
Fosdick
the
first
executive
officer
of
the
CTCA
was
Richard
Byrd
,
whose
name
in
later
years
was
to
become
synonymous
with
activities
at
the
polar
antipodes
.

From
the
point
of
view
of
popularity
the
best-known
member
of
the
Commission
was
Walter
Camp
,
the
Yale
athlete
whose
sobriquet
was
``
the
father
of
American
football
''
.

The
CTCA
program
of
activities
was
profuse
:
William
Farnum
and
Mary
Pickford
on
the
screen
,
Elsie
Janis
and
Harry
Lauder
on
the
stage
,
books
provided
by
the
American
Library
Association
,
full
equipment
for
games
and
sports
--
except
that
no
``
bones
''
were
furnished
for
the
all-time
favorite
pastime
played
on
any
floor
and
known
as
``
African
golf
''
.

And
the
entirety
of
the
natural
world
is
party
to
the
action
.

In
tragedy
,
lightning
is
a
messenger
.

Similarly
the
sufferings
of
Hamlet
,
Othello
,
or
Phedre
engage
the
fortunes
of
the
state
.

Hence
the
natural
setting
of
tragedy
is
the
palace
gate
,
the
public
square
,
or
the
court
chamber
.

But
one
major
fact
seems
undeniable
.

Until
the
advent
of
rational
empiricism
the
controlling
habits
of
the
western
mind
were
symbolic
and
allegoric
.

Goethe
believed
that
the
Germanic
spirit
,
with
its
grave
strength
but
flagrant
streaks
of
brutality
and
intolerance
,
should
be
tempered
with
the
old
sensuous
wisdom
and
humanism
of
the
Hellenic
.

Faust
rescuing
Helen
from
Menelaus'
vengeance
is
the
genius
of
renaissance
Europe
restoring
to
life
the
classic
tradition
.

The
Bishop
of
Gloucester
described
the
elder
Thomas
in
1577
as
the
richest
recusant
in
his
diocese
,
worth
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
in
lands
and
goods
.

Thomas
the
elder
married
twice
,
had
seventeen
children
,
and
died
in
1615
.

Sturley
on
November
4
answered
a
letter
from
Quiney
written
on
October
25
which
imported
,
wrote
Sturley
,
``
that
our
countriman
Mr.
Wm.
Shak.
would
procure
us
monei
:
which
I
will
like
of
as
I
shall
heare
when
,
wheare
&
howe
:
and
I
prai

it

condicions
.

Allso
that
if
monei
might
be
had
for
30
or
40
a
lease
&
might
be
procured
''
.

This
seems
to
refer
,
not
to
the
loan
Richard
had
asked
for
,
but
to
a
proposed
bargain
with
Shakespeare
.

His
mother
Bess
,
who
could
not
write
herself
,
reminded
her
husband
through
Sturley
to
buy
the
apron
he
had
promised
her
and
``
a
suite
of
hattes
for
5
boies
the
yongst
lined
&
trimmed
with
silke
''
(
for
John
,
only
a
year
old
)
.

His
letter
of
October
26
named
two
of
the
men
about
whom
Quiney
had
written
to
Shakespeare
the
day
before
.

&
synce
I
did
write
unto
him
to
dessier
him
to
paie
10
for
mee
which
standeth
mee
greatly
uppon
to
have
paide
.

He
asked
Quiney
to
find
out
whether
the
money
had
been
paid
and
,
if
not
,
to
send
to
the
lodging
of
Sir
Edward
and
entreat
him
to
pay
what
he
owed
.

Stratford's
petition
to
the
queen
declared
that
two
great
fires
had
burnt
two
hundred
houses
in
the
town
,
with
household
goods
,
to
the
value
of
twelve
thousand
pounds
.

The
queen
agreed
on
December
17
,
a
warrant
was
signed
on
January
27
,
and
the
Exchequer
paid
Quiney
his
expenses
on
February
27
,
.

another
I
bought
there
to
bring
me
home
7
weeks
;
;

If
he
borrowed
money
from
Shakespeare
or
with
his
help
,
he
would
now
have
been
able
to
repay
the
loan
.

Since
more
is
known
about
Quiney
than
about
any
other
acquaintance
of
Shakespeare
in
Stratford
,
his
career
may
be
followed
to
its
sudden
end
in
1602
.

He
set
down
that
``
I
gave
Mr.
Greene
a
pynte
of
muskadell
and
a
roll
of
bread
that
last
morning
I
went
to
have
his
company
to
Master
Attorney
''
.

Adams
firmly
contended
that
the
historian
must
never
underrate
the
impact
of
the
geographical
environment
on
history
.

The
failure
of
Greece
to
reach
the
imperial
destiny
that
Periclean
Athens
had
seemed
to
promise
was
almost
directly
attributable
to
her
physical
conformation
.

However
,
as
a
practicing
historian
,
he
,
himself
,
has
left
few
clues
to
the
amount
of
professional
scholarship
that
he
used
when
writing
history
.

In
fact
,
if
judgments
are
to
be
rendered
upon
the
soundness
of
his
historicism
,
they
must
be
based
on
scanty
evidence
.

A
credulousness
,
a
distaste
for
documentation
,
an
uncritical
reliance
on
contemporary
accounts
,
and
a
proneness
to
assume
a
theory
as
true
before
adequate
proof
was
provided
were
all
evidences
of
his
failure
to
comprehend
the
use
of
the
scientific
method
or
to
evaluate
the
responsibilities
of
the
historian
to
his
reading
public
.

This
is
not
to
assume
that
his
work
was
without
merit
,
but
the
validity
of
his
assumptions
concerning
the
meaning
of
history
must
always
be
considered
against
this
background
of
an
unprofessional
approach
.

His
credulity
is
perhaps
best
illustrated
in
his
introduction
to
The
Emancipation
Of
Massachusetts
,
which
purports
to
examine
the
trials
of
Moses
and
to
draw
a
parallel
between
the
leader
of
the
Israelite
exodus
from
Egypt
and
the
leadership
of
the
Puritan
clergy
in
colonial
New
England
.

Impartiality
to
him
meant
an
unwillingness
to
generalize
and
to
search
for
a
synthesis
.

Ranke
and
his
disciples
had
reduced
history
to
a
profession
of
dullness
;
;

All
of
Adams'
work
reflects
this
dogmatic
characteristic
.

One
example
of
this
was
his
assertion
that
``
all
servile
revolts
must
be
dealt
with
by
physical
force
''
.

Brooks
Adams
considered
religion
as
an
extremely
significant
manifestation
of
man's
fear
of
the
unknown
.

Religion
and
the
churches
were
institutions
which
had
been
created
by
man
,
not
God
.

Certainly
,
he
must
recognize
its
power
and
attempt
to
ascertain
its
influence
on
the
flow
of
history
,
but
he
must
not
confuse
the
natural
and
the
mundane
with
the
divine
.

It
was
the
use
of
the
supernatural
that
kept
them
in
business
.

The
German
barbarians
of
the
fourth
century
offered
an
excellent
example
:

These
basic
ideas
concerning
the
nature
of
religion
were
,
Adams
believed
,
some
of
the
major
keys
to
the
understanding
of
history
and
the
movement
of
society
.

In
The
Law
Of
Civilization
And
Decay
Brooks
Adams
traced
this
evolution
,
always
pointing
to
the
fact
that
although
the
forms
became
more
rational
,
the
substance
remained
unchanged
.

The
relic
worship
and
monasticism
of
the
Middle
Ages
were
more
advanced
forms
than
were
primitive
fetish
worship
and
nature
myths
.

Yet
,
the
idea
imbedded
in
each
was
identical
:
to
surround
the
unknown
with
mystery
and
to
isolate
that
class
which
had
been
given
special
dominion
over
the
secrets
of
God
.

Stephens
had
written
his
classic
``
incidents
of
travel
''
about
these
regions
a
hundred
years
before
,
and
Catherwood
,
who
had
studied
Piranesi
in
London
and
the
great
ruins
of
Egypt
and
Greece
,
had
drawn
the
splendid
illustrations
that
accompanied
the
text
.

His
metier
was
the
American
tropics
,
and
he
had
lived
all
over
Latin
America
and
among
the
primitive
tribes
on
the
Amazon
river
.

Well
he
knew
the
sleepless
nights
,
the
howling
sore-ridden
dogs
and
the
biting
insects
in
the
villages
of
the
Kofanes
and
Huitotoes
.

In
fact
,
he
had
raised
quetzal
birds
in
his
camp
in
the
forest
of
Ecuador
.

Never
hearing
from
him
again
,
I
remembered
the
little
boy
of
whom
I
had
had
such
doubts
when
he
was
ten
years
old
.

It
reminded
me
of
my
other
professor
,
Edward
Kennard
Rand
,
of
whom
I
had
been
so
fond
when
I
was
at
Harvard
,
the
great
mediaevalist
and
classical
scholar
who
had
asked
me
to
call
him
``
Ken
''
,
saying
,
``
Age
counts
for
nothing
among
those
who
have
learned
to
know
life
sub
specie
aeternitatis
''
.

He
felt
as
I
felt
about
this
best
of
all
my
books
,
that
it
was
``
really
tops
''
.

Two
or
three
times
,
C.
C.
Burlingham
came
to
lunch
with
us
in
Weston
,
that
wonderful
man
who
lived
to
be
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
and
whose
birthplace
had
been
my
Wall
Street
suburb
.

His
reading
ranged
from
Agatha
Christie
to
The
Book
Of
Job
and
he
had
an
insatiable
interest
in
his
fellow-creatures
,
while
his
letters
were
full
of
gossip
about
new
politicians
and
old
men
of
letters
with
whom
he
had
been
intimately
thrown
six
decades
before
.

Then
I
spoke
at
the
ninetieth
birthday
party
of
W.
E.
Burghardt
Du
Bois
,
who
embarked
on
a
fictional
trilogy
at
eighty-nine
and
who
,
with
The
Crisis
,
had
created
a
Negro
intelligentsia
that
had
never
existed
in
America
before
him
.

And
his
memory
,
like
an
elephant's
,
stored
with
precise
knowledge
of
men
and
things
and
happenings
''
.

Finally
,
colleges
and
clubs
took
the
line
that
speakers
from
England
were
not
wanted
any
longer
,
even
speakers
like
S.K.
,
so
unlike
the
novelists
and
poets
who
had
patronized
the
Americans
for
many
years
.

Many
years
later
I
went
to
see
S.K.
in
England
,
where
he
was
living
at
Whiteleaf
,
near
Aylesbury
,
and
he
showed
me
beside
his
cottage
there
the
remains
of
the
road
on
which
Boadicea
is
supposed
to
have
travelled
.

Would
he
meet
him
in
Baltimore
in
Drawing
Room
A
,
Car
Three
on
the
train
leaving
Washington
at
nine
o'clock
next
morning
?
?

On
January
4
,
with
the
boys
back
at
school
and
college
,
Mrs.
Lewis
wrote
Harcourt
to
say
that
she
was
``
through
,
quite
through
''
.

Harcourt
replied
:
``
I
do
really
hope
you
can
achieve
serenity
in
the
course
of
time
.

They
were
strays
of
every
kind
--
university
students
and
journalists
,
Village
hangers-on
and
barflies
,
taxi
drivers
and
editors
and
unknown
poets
,
as
well
as
friends
like
Elinor
Wylie
and
William
Rose
Benet
,
the
Van
Dorens
and
Nathan
,
Rebecca
West
and
Hugh
Walpole
and
Osbert
Sitwell
,
Laurence
Stallings
,
Lewis
Browne
,
William
Seabrook
,
Arthur
Hopkins
,
the
Woodwards
.

He
was
outraged
by
the
book
and
announced
that
he
had
discovered
fifty
technical
errors
in
its
account
of
church
practices
.

But
his
rancor
did
not
cease
,
and
presently
,
on
March
13
,
when
he
preached
a
sermon
on
the
text
,
``
And
Ben-hadad
Was
Drunk
''
,
he
told
his
congregation
how
disappointed
he
was
in
Mr.
Lewis
,
how
he
regretted
having
had
him
in
his
house
,
and
how
he
should
have
been
warned
by
the
fact
that
the
novelist
was
drunk
all
the
time
that
he
was
working
on
the
book
.

But
that
sermon
,
like
those
of
hundreds
of
other
ministers
,
was
yet
to
be
delivered
.

In
London
Lewis
took
the
usual
suite
in
Bury
Street
.

His
English
friends
,
it
said
,
had
gone
into
training
to
keep
up
with
him
vocally
and
with
his
``
allegro
movements
around
the
luncheon
table
''
.

He
invited
Lady
Sybil
,
Lord
Thomson
,
Bechhofer
Roberts
,
and
a
half
dozen
others
.

It
was
a
dinner
party
,
Lewis
had
been
drinking
during
the
afternoon
,
and
long
before
the
party
really
got
under
way
,
he
was
quite
drunk
,
with
the
result
that
the
party
broke
up
even
before
dinner
was
over
.

Finally
,
at
dawn
,
he
fell
asleep
,
and
when
he
awoke
and
came
into
the
living
room
,
he
found
Lewis
in
his
pajamas
before
the
fire
,
smoking
a
cigarette
.

He
suggested
that
they
call
on
these
brothers
,
who
received
them
pleasantly
.

He
became
a
fellow
of
Jesus
in
1629
,
proceeded
M.A.
from
Jesus
in
1632
,
and
was
proctor
in
1639-40
.

The
third
name
was
(
John
)
Ravencroft
,
who
was
admitted
to
the
Inner
Temple
in
November
1631
.

Small
wonder
that
Milton
later
boasted
of
how
well
his
work
had
been
received
there
,
since
he
attained
a
rank
in
the
order
of
commencing
bachelors
higher
than
that
of
any
other
inceptor
from
Christ's
of
that
year
.

Then
the
various
officers
of
the
college
might
take
up
the
case
.

He
had
also
learned
to
dispute
extempore
remarkably
well
,
the
main
evidence
for
which
of
course
is
the
presence
of
his
name
in
the
honors
list
of
.

His
early
poems
and
some
of
his
prose
prolusions
speak
of
wanderings
in
the
city
and
the
neighboring
country
that
may
be
extended
to
Cambridge
and
its
surrounding
countryside
.

The
churches
,
the
taverns
,
and
the
various
other
places
of
the
town
must
have
known
his
figure
well
as
he
roved
to
and
about
them
.

He
smoked
,
as
did
everybody
,
and
imbibed
the
various
alcoholic
beverages
of
that
day
,
although
his
protestations
while
at
Cambridge
and
after
that
he
was
no
drunkard
point
to
reasonable
abstinence
from
the
wild
drinking
bouts
of
some
of
the
undergraduates
and
,
we
must
add
,
of
some
of
their
elders
including
many
of
the
regents
or
teachers
.

That
is
,
if
we
can
trust
that
most
specious
of
prolusions
,
packed
as
it
is
with
wit
and
persiflage
.

Perhaps
his
most
important
private
activity
was
the
combination
of
reading
,
discussion
with
a
few
--
if
we
can
trust
his
writings
to
Diodati
and
the
younger
Gill
,
very
few
--
congenial
companions
.

Lines
23-36
of
Lycidas
later
point
to
a
friendship
with
Edward
King
,
who
entered
Christ's
College
9
June
1626
.

But
that
scarcely
means
that
he
was
the
aloof
,
forbidding
type
of
student
who
shared
few
if
any
activities
with
his
fellows
,
the
banter
of
the
surviving
prolusions
providing
enough
evidence
to
deny
this
.

Apparently
he
was
not
a
participant
in
the
college
or
university
theatricals
,
which
he
once
attacked
as
utterly
unworthy
performances
(
see
Apology
,
3:300
)
;
;

The
fact
that
he
nowhere
mentioned
theatrical
performances
as
part
of
the
activities
of
the
boys
later
in
his
hypothetical
academy
(
1644
)
should
not
be
taken
too
seriously
as
evidence
that
he
desired
them
to
eschew
such
performances
.

Perhaps
,
in
that
short
piece
or
letter
written
to
Hartlib
in
which
he
sketched
his
scheme
for
educating
young
men
,
he
merely
overlooked
that
phase
of
their
exercises
.

In
Arthur
Clarke's
Childhood's
End
(
1953
)
,
though
written
after
the
present
flood
of
dystopias
began
,
we
can
see
the
bright
vision
of
science
fiction
clearly
defined
.

Arriving
just
in
time
to
stop
men
from
turning
their
planet
into
a
radioactive
wasteland
,
the
Overlords
unite
earth
into
one
world
in
which
justice
,
order
,
and
benevolence
prevail
and
ignorance
,
poverty
,
and
fear
have
ceased
to
exist
.

Under
their
rule
,
earth
becomes
a
technological
utopia
.

Among
the
dystopias
,
for
example
,
Isaac
Asimov's
The
Caves
Of
Steel
(
1954
)
portrays
the
deadly
effects
on
human
life
of
the
super-city
of
the
future
;
;

Frederick
Pohl's
``
The
Midas
Touch
''
(
1954
)
predicts
an
economy
of
abundance
which
,
in
order
to
remain
prosperous
,
must
set
its
robots
to
consuming
surplus
production
;
;

What
makes
the
current
phenomenon
unique
is
that
so
many
science-fiction
writers
have
reversed
a
trend
and
turned
to
writing
works
critical
of
the
impact
of
science
and
technology
on
human
life
.

Since
the
great
flood
of
these
dystopias
has
appeared
only
in
the
last
twelve
years
,
it
seems
fairly
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
chief
impetus
was
the
1949
publication
of
Nineteen
Eighty-Four
,
an
assumption
which
is
supported
by
the
frequent
echoes
of
such
details
as
Room
101
,
along
with
education
by
conditioning
from
Brave
New
World
,
a
book
to
which
science-fiction
writers
may
well
have
returned
with
new
interest
after
reading
the
more
powerful
Orwell
dystopia
.

Not
all
recent
science
fiction
,
however
,
is
dystopian
,
for
the
optimistic
strain
is
still
very
much
alive
in
Mission
Of
Gravity
and
Childhood's
End
,
as
we
have
seen
,
as
well
as
in
many
other
recent
popular
novels
and
stories
like
Fred
Hoyle's
The
Black
Cloud
(
1957
)
;
;

and
among
works
of
dystopian
science
fiction
,
not
all
provide
intelligent
criticism
and
very
few
have
much
merit
as
literature
--
but
then
real
quality
has
always
been
scarce
in
science
fiction
.

In
addition
,
there
are
many
areas
of
the
human
situation
besides
the
impact
of
science
and
technology
which
are
examined
,
for
science-fiction
dystopias
often
extrapolate
political
,
social
,
economic
tendencies
only
indirectly
related
to
science
and
technology
.

Nevertheless
,
with
all
these
qualifications
and
exceptions
,
the
current
dystopian
phenomenon
remains
impressive
for
its
criticism
that
science
and
technology
,
instead
of
bringing
utopia
,
may
well
enslave
,
dehumanize
,
and
even
destroy
men
.

How
effectively
these
warnings
can
be
presented
is
seen
in
Pohl
and
Kornbluth's
The
Space
Merchants
,
Vonnegut's
Player
Piano
and
Wyndham's
Re-Birth
.

The
consequences
,
of
course
,
have
been
dreadful
:
reckless
expansion
has
led
to
overpopulation
,
pollution
of
the
earth
and
depletion
of
its
natural
resources
.

While
The
Space
Merchants
indicates
,
as
Kingsley
Amis
has
correctly
observed
,
some
of
the
``
impending
consequences
of
the
growth
of
industrial
and
commercial
power
''
and
satirizes
``
existing
habits
in
the
advertising
profession
''
,
its
warning
and
analysis
penetrate
much
deeper
.

The
Space
Merchants
,
like
such
humanist
documents
as
Joseph
Wood
Krutch's
The
Measure
Of
Man
and
C.
S.
Lewis's
The
Abolition
Of
Man
,
considers
what
may
result
from
the
scientific
study
of
human
nature
.

We
often
say
of
a
person
that
he
``
looks
young
for
his
age
''
or
``
old
for
his
age
''
.

Stigmata
quite
sufficient
for
diagnosis
are
nevertheless
there
.

age
may
be
idealistic
,
believing
and
much
given
to
professions
of
optimism
.

If
it
proclaims
that
the
best
is
yet
to
be
,
it
always
arouses
,
at
least
in
the
young
,
either
a
suspicious
question
or
perhaps
the
exclamation
of
the
Negro
youth
who
saw
on
a
tombstone
the
inscription
,
``
I
am
not
dead
but
sleeping
''
.

But
at
least
the
question
has
been
raised
.

I
have
changed
and
I
have
reversed
opinions
;
;

That
fact
is
very
clearly
illustrated
in
the
case
of
the
many
present-day
intellectuals
who
were
Communists
or
near-Communists
in
their
youth
and
are
now
so
extremely
conservative
(
or
reactionary
,
as
many
would
say
)
that
they
can
define
no
important
political
conviction
that
does
not
seem
so
far
from
even
a
centrist
position
as
to
make
the
distinction
between
Mr.
Nixon
and
Mr.
Khrushchev
for
them
hardly
worth
noting
.

To
those
of
my
readers
who
find
many
of
my
opinions
morally
,
or
politically
,
or
sociologically
antiquated
(
and
I
have
reason
to
know
that
there
are
some
such
)
,
I
would
like
to
say
what
I
have
already
hinted
,
namely
,
that
some
of
my
opinions
may
indeed
be
subject
to
some
discount
on
the
simple
ground
that
I
am
no
longer
young
and
therefore
incapable
of
being
youthful
of
mind
.

so
that
,
although
not
as
eager
as
I
once
was
to
be
disapproved
of
,
I
can
still
resist
prevailing
opinions
.

At
about
the
age
of
twelve
I
became
a
Spencerian
liberal
,
and
I
have
always
considered
myself
a
liberal
of
some
kind
even
though
the
definition
has
changed
repeatedly
since
Spencer
became
a
reactionary
.

The
favorite
excuse
of
those
who
have
now
recanted
their
approval
of
communism
is
that
they
did
not
know
how
things
would
develop
.

``
Well
''
,
I
replied
,
``
some
of
my
colleagues
on
the
paper
regard
me
as
a
rank
reactionary
''
.

And
I
suppose
it
did
.

When
I
first
came
across
Samuel
Johnson's
pronouncement
,
``
the
remedy
for
the
ills
of
life
is
palliative
rather
than
radical
''
,
it
seemed
to
me
to
sum
up
the
profoundest
of
political
and
social
truths
.

The
reason
is
,
I
think
,
my
awareness
that
my
remarks
last
quarter
on
pacifism
may
well
have
served
to
confirm
the
opinion
of
some
that
my
tendency
to
skepticism
and
dissent
gets
us
nowhere
,
and
that
I
am
simply
too
old
to
hope
.

I
know
that
one
must
act
.

What
is
the
trick
''
?
?

Cynical
?
?

It
is
not
something
that
can
be
expected
to
happen
now
.

Without
really
changing
the
general
subject
,
I
take
this
opportunity
to
confess
that
I
am
troubled
by
doubts
,
not
only
about
pacifism
,
but
also
when
asked
to
join
in
the
protest
against
a
law
that
most
of
those
who
consider
themselves
humane
and
liberal
seem
to
regard
as
obviously
barbarous
;
;

Seems
to
me
to
create
a
dilemma
not
to
be
satisfactorily
disposed
of
by
a
simple
negative
answer
.

1
,

The
work
as
it
stands
is
not
the
entire
book
that
Malraux
wrote
at
that
time
--
it
is
only
the
first
section
of
a
three-part
novel
called
La
Lutte
avec
l'Ange
;
;

Even
so
apparently
impartial
a
critic
as
W.
H.
Frohock
has
taken
for
granted
that
the
book
was
originally
intended
as
a
piece
of
Loyalist
propaganda
;
;

Nothing
,
however
,
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
.

The
whole
purpose
of
Man's
Hope
is
to
portray
the
tragic
dialectic
between
means
and
ends
inherent
in
all
organized
political
violence
--
and
even
when
such
violence
is
a
necessary
and
legitimate
self-defense
of
liberty
,
justice
and
human
dignity
.

``
Man
engages
only
a
small
part
of
himself
in
an
action
''
says
old
Alvear
the
art-historian
;
;

On
the
contrary
,
the
frenzy
and
furor
of
combat
is
only
the
sombre
foil
against
which

sudden
illuminations
of
the
human
flash

radiance
of

Caravaggio
.

,

they
instinctively
struggle
to
keep
open
a
road
to
the
future
in
their
hearts
.

And
by
a
skillful
and
unobtrusive
use
of
imagery
(
the
enclosure
is
called
a
``
Roman-camp
stockade
''
,
the
hastily
erected
lean-to
is
a
``
Babylonian
hovel
''
,
the
men
begin
to
look
like
``
Peruvian
mummies
''
and
to
acquire
``
Gothic
faces
''
)
,
Malraux
projects
a
fresco
of
human
endurance
--
which
is
also
the
endurance
of
the
human
--
stretching
backward
into
the
dark
abyss
of
time
.

Is
this
not
Malraux
himself
alluding
to
his
own
earlier
infatuation
with
the
ideological
?
?

But
now
he
knows
``
that
an
intellectual
is
not
only
a
man
to
whom
books
are
necessary
,
he
is
any
man
whose
reasoning
,
however
elementary
it
may
be
,
affects
and
directs
his
life
''
.

and
the
narrator
recalls
the
words
of
his
father
,
Vincent
Berger
:
``
It
is
not
by
any
amount
of
scratching
at
the
individual
that
one
finally
comes
down
to
mankind
''
.

This
has
been
his
first
encounter
with
mankind
,
and
,
although
he
has
now
become
a
legendary
figure
in
the
popular
European
press
,
it
leaves
him
profoundly
dissatisfied
.

Citing
the
experience
of
the
Combined
Chiefs
of
Staff
in
World
War
2
,
,
Eden
said
that
all
would
have
been
confusion
and
disarray
without
them
.

Many
factors
contributed
to
the
growth
of
the
European
movement
.

New
organs
of
unification
proliferated
in
the
decade
following
the
conclusion
of
the
NATO
alliance
.

In
1949
the
Council
of
Europe
came
into
existence
,
a
purely
consultative
parliamentary
body
but
the
first
organ
of
political
rather
than
functional
unity
.

The
United
States
and
Canada
belong
only
to
NATO
and
the
new
O.E.C.D.
.

The
time
is
now
ripe
,
indeed
overdue
,
for
the
vigorous
development
of
its
non-military
potentialities
,
for
its
development
as
an
instrument
of
Atlantic
community
.

The
problem
of
NATO
is
not
one
of
machinery
,
of
which
there
is
an
abundance
,
but
of
the
will
to
use
it
.

The
NATO
Council
is
available
as
an
executive
agency
,
the
Standing
Group
as
a
high
military
authority
.

This
machinery
will
not
become
the
instrument
of
an
Atlantic
community
by
fiat
,
but
only
when
that
community
evolves
from
potentiality
to
reality
.

Underlying
these
hopes
and
prescriptions
is
a
conviction
that
the
nations
of
the
North
Atlantic
area
do
indeed
form
a
community
,
at
least
a
potential
community
.

A
realistic
balancing
of
the
need
for
new
forms
of
international
organization
on
the
one
hand
,
and
our
capacity
to
achieve
them
on
the
other
,
must
be
approached
through
the
concept
of
``
community
''
.

Only
when
a
concert
of
nations
rests
on
the
positive
foundations
of
shared
goals
and
values
is
it
likely
to
form
a
viable
instrument
of
long-range
policy
.

It
follows
that
the
solution
to
the
current
disunity
of
the
free
nations
is
only
to
a
very
limited
extent
a
matter
of
devising
new
machinery
of
consultation
and
coordination
.

The
defect
of
these
proposals
is
in
their
attempt
to
outrun
history
and
their
assumption
that
because
something
may
be
desirable
it
is
also
possible
.

The
history
of
the
U.N.
demonstrates
that
in
a
pluralistic
world
we
must
develop
processes
of
influence
and
persuasion
rather
than
coercion
.

But
a
powerful
sense
of
community
,
even
with
little
or
no
machinery
,
means
a
great
deal
.

``
It
might
well
start
a
craze
like
swallowing
goldfish
or
pee-wee
golf
''
,
wrote
Kenneth
Rexroth
in
an
explanatory
note
in
the
Evergreen
Review
,
and
he
may
have
been
right
.

Even
musicians
themselves
have
taken
to
writing
poetry
.

)
The
stated
goal
of
the
CJS
is
the
synthesis
of
jazz
and
``
serious
''
music
.

From
the
beginning
of
his
career
,
Patchen
has
adopted
an
anti-intellectual
approach
to
poetry
.

This
salvation
does
not
take
the
form
of
a
Christian
Heaven
.

Patchen
has
almost
never
used
strict
poetic
forms
;
;

These
early
experiments
were
evidently
not
altogether
satisfying
to
Patchen
.

Beginning
in
Cloth
Of
The
Tempest
(
1943
)
he
experimented
in
merging
poetry
and
visual
art
,
using
drawings
to
carry
long
narrative
segments
of
a
story
,
as
in
Sleepers
Awake
,
and
constructing
elaborate
``
poems-in-drawing-and-type
''
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
between
the
``
art
''
and
the
poetry
.

The
private
detective
is
militant
against
injustice
,
a
humorous
and
ironic
explorer
of
the
underworld
;
;

In
The
Memoirs
Of
A
Shy
Pornographer
(
1945
)
Patchen
exploited
this
national
sentiment
by
making
his
hero
,
Albert
Budd
,
a
private
detective
.

Neither
of
these
poems
is
an
aberration
;
;

In
many
of
his
poems
,
death
comes
by
train
:
a
strongly
evocative
visual
image
.

Perhaps
Patchen
was
once
involved
in
a
train
accident
,
and
this
passage
from
First
Will
And
Testament
may
have
been
how
the
accident
appeared
to
the
poet
when
he
first
saw
it
--
if
he
did
:
``

They
did
not
``
duck
the
war
''
but
they
fought
in
it
,
however
reluctantly
;
;

It
is
a
publishing
and
public
relations
center
,
but
these
very
facts
prevent
it
from
being
a
literary
center
because
writers
dislike
provincialism
and
untruth
.

we
were
also
literary
;
;

their
reading
and
thinking
gave
an
extension
to
their
normal
blushes
about
appearing
'
Jewish
'
in
subway
,
bus
,
racetrack
,
movie
house
,
any
of
the
public
places
that
used
to
make
the
Jew
of
my
generation
self-conscious
(
heavy
thinkers
walking
across
Seventh
Avenue
without
their
glasses
on
,
willing
to
dare
the
trucks
as
long
as
they
didn't
look
like
the
ikey-kikey
caricature
of
the
Yiddish
intellectual
)
.

Finally
,
there
is
the
undeniable
fact
that
some
of
the
finest
American
fiction
is
being
written
by
Jews
,
but
it
is
not
Jewish
fiction
;
;

Krim
came
to
believe
that
``
the
novel
as
a
form
had
outlived
its
vital
meaning
''
.

Sociological
jargon
,
Germano-Slavic
approximations
to
English
,
third-rate
but
modish
fiction
,
and
outrages
to
common
sense
have
often
disfigured
Partisan
,
and
in
lesser
degree
,
the
other
magazines
on
the
list
.

Without
the
good
magazines
,
without
their
book
reviews
,
their
hospitality
to
European
writers
,
without
above
all
their
awareness
of
literary
standards
,
we
might
very
well
have
had
a
generation
of
Krim's
heroes
--
Wolfes
,
Farrells
,
Dreisers
,
and
I
might
add
,
Sandburgs
and
Frosts
and
MacLeishes
in
verse
--
and
then
where
would
we
be
?
?

The
universities
certainly
were
not
doing
it
,
nor
were
the
popular
magazines
of
the
day
.

If
,
the
editors
sometimes
,
dozed
and
printed
pretentious
,
New
,
York-mind
,
dross
,
they
,
also
printed
,
Malraux
,
,
Silone
,
,
Chiaromonte
,
,
Gide
,
Bellow
,
,
Robert
Lowell
,
Francis
Fergusson
,
Mary
McCarthy
,
Delmore
Schwartz
,
Mailer
,
Elizabeth
Hardwick
,
Eleanor
Clark
,
,
and
a
host
of
,
other
good
writers
.

It
is
a
fact
of
life
that
magazines
are
edited
by
groups
:
they
have
to
be
or
they
wouldn't
be
published
at
all
.

Literary
movements
are
the
''
,
creation
of
pimps
who
live
off
writers
.

My
``
touchstones
,
had
,
been
strictly
''
literature
and
,
humanly
enough
,
American
literature
(
because
that
was
what
I
wanted
to
write
)
.

He
alludes
to
something
called
direct
writing
,
and
he
finds
that
criticism
gets
in
the
way
of
his
truer
,
realer
,
imaginative
bounce
.

There
were
other
Italians
who
still
bore
scars
they
had
earned
in
police
station
basements
,
resisting
.

On
his
bookshelves
were
some
of
the
latest
American
novels
,
including
Bellow's
Seize
The
Day
,
but
he
hadn't
read
them
(
they
were
sent
by
American
publishers
)
and
wasn't
especially
interested
in
what
the
American
writers
were
up
to
.

He
was
interested
in
Italo
Svevo
.

He
was
thinking
his
way
into
a
new
novel
,
a
big
one
,
one
that
people
had
been
waiting
for
.

It
was
going
to
be
hard
going
all
the
way
because
he
hadn't
written
seriously
for
a
while
,
except
for
a
few
stories
,
was
tired
of
the
old
method
of
realismo
he
had
so
successfully
used
in
The
Sky
Is
Red
.

Berto
seemed
worried
,
too
.

Rimanelli
is
tough
and
square-built
and
adventurous
,
says
what
he
thinks
.

We
were
at
a
party
once
and
heard
an
idealistic
young
European
call
that
awful
charge
glorious
.

Our
companion
was
a
huge
,
plain-spoken
American
sculptor
who
had
been
a
sixteen-year-old
rifleman
all
across
France
in
1944
.

It
was
the
last
time
in
history
anybody
could
do
something
gloriously
like
that
''
.

I
thought
:
Who
is
older
now
?
?

The
sculptor
looked
at
him
,
bugeyed
and
amazed
,
angry
.

They
went
up
against
an
SS
unit
of
comparable
size
,
over
a
little
rise
of
ground
,
over
an
open
field
.

Object
--
a
village
crossroads
.

They
made
it
,
killed
every
last
one
of
the
Krauts
,
took
the
village
on
schedule
.

The
whole
thing
,
from
the
moment
when
they
jumped
heavily
off
the
trucks
,
spread
out
and
moved
into
position
just
behind
the
cover
of
that
slight
rise
of
ground
and
then
jumped
off
,
took
maybe
between
twenty
and
thirty
minutes
.

There
is
a
bronze
wreath
on
the
wall
.

(
It
is
sort
of
as
if
our
government
should
decide
to
disown
Washington
or
Lincoln
for
the
same
reason
.

Some
of
the
marble
busts
in
the
park
are
of
young
Englishmen
who
fought
and
died
for
Garibaldi
.

He
had
crashed
on
takeoff
once
before
.

No
poetry
,
no
airplanes
,
no
dancers
.

She
had
been
picked
up
by
the
Russians
,
questioned
in
connection
with
some
pamphlets
,
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
for
espionage
.

She
escaped
,
crawled
through
the
usual
mine
fields
,
under
barbed
wire
,
was
shot
at
,
swam
a
river
,
and
we
finally
picked
her
up
in
Linz
.

Just
no
spot
,
not
even
a
dimesize
spot
,
on
her
whole
body
that
wasn't
bruised
,
bruise
on
top
of
bruise
,
from
beatings
.

The
trouble
is
that
like
many
symbols
it
doesn't
seem
a
very
realistic
one
.

The
English
lady
wanted
to
pay
tribute
to
Garibaldi
and
to
Lauro
Di
Bosis
,
but
she
wasn't
going
to
be
here
to
do
it
.

I
thought
:
What
the
hell
?
?

Why
not
?
?

I
said
I
would
do
it
for
her
.

I
admire
the
English
lady
.

Though
Garibaldi's
fight
was
small
shakes
compared
to
Pickett's
Charge
--
which
,
like
all
Southerners
,
I
view
in
almost
Miltonic
terms
,
fallen
angels
,
etc.
--
I
associated
the
two
.

So
much
for
all
that

Requirements

Funds
contributed
by
the
Government
are
repaid
by
a
royalty
on
production
from
the
property
.

A
5-percent
royalty
is
paid
on
any
production
during
the
period
the
contract
is
in
effect
;
;

In
most
of
the
less
developed
countries
,
however
,
such
programing
is
at
best
inadequate
and
at
worst
nonexistent
.

.

First
,
we
can
encourage
responsibility
by
establishing
as
conditions
for
assistance
on
a
substantial
and
sustained
scale
the
definition
of
objectives
and
the
assessment
of
costs
.

Thus
,
we
might
provide
limited
assistance
in
such
fields
as
education
,
essential
transport
,
communications
,
and
agricultural
improvement
despite
the
absence
of
acceptable
country
programs
.

At
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
,
where
the
more
advanced
countries
can
be
relied
upon
to
make
well
thought
through
decisions
as
to
project
priorities
within
a
consistent
program
,
we
should
be
prepared
to
depart
substantially
from
detailed
project
approval
as
the
basis
for
granting
assistance
and
to
move
toward
long-term
support
,
in
cooperation
with
other
developed
countries
,
of
the
essential
foreign
exchange
requirements
of
the
country's
development
program
.

External
aid
can
only
be
marginal
,
although
the
margin
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
Marshall
plan
,
can
be
decisive
.

External
aid
can
be
effective
only
if
it
is
a
complement
to
self-help
.

The
major
areas
of
self-help
are
the
following
:
(
A
)
the
effective
mobilizing
of
resources
.

(
B
)
the
reduction
of
dependence
on
external
sources
.

Otherwise
,
development
will
not
lead
to
longrun
stability
.

(
D
)
honesty
in
government
.

3
.

Even
in
these
cases
we
should
promote
self-help
by
making
it
clear
that
our
supporting
assistance
is
subject
to
reduction
and
ultimately
to
termination
.

Encouraging
a
long-term
approach

The
most
fundamental
concept
of
the
new
approach
to
economic
aid
is
the
focusing
of
our
attention
,
our
resources
,
and
our
energies
on
the
effort
to
promote
the
economic
and
social
development
of
the
less
developed
countries
.

This
is
not
a
short-run
goal
.

To
have
any
success
in
this
effort
,
we
must
ourselves
view
it
as
an
enterprise
stretching
over
a
considerable
number
of
years
,
and
we
must
encourage
the
recipients
of
our
aid
to
view
it
in
the
same
fashion
.

How
long
it
will
take
to
show
substantial
success
in
this
effort
will
vary
greatly
from
country
to
country
.

The
whole
program
must
be
conceived
of
as
an
effort
,
stretching
over
a
considerable
number
of
years
,
to
alter
the
basic
social
and
economic
conditions
in
the
less
developed
world
.

It
must
be
recognized
as
a
slow-acting
tool
designed
to
prevent
political
and
military
crises
such
as
those
recently
confronted
in
Laos
and
Cuba
.

(
A
)
the
need
to
budget
a
period
of
years
.

If
the
less
developed
countries
are
to
be
persuaded
to
adopt
a
long-term
approach
,
the
United
States
,
as
the
principal
supplier
of
external
aid
,
must
be
prepared
to
give
long-term
commitments
.

So
,
I
say
,
Mr.
Speaker
,
God
bless
you
and
keep
you
for
many
years
not
only
for
this
body
but
for
the
United
States
of
America
and
the
free
world
.

Mr.
Speaker
,
I
ask
unanimous
consent
that
all
Members
who
desire
to
do
so
may
extend
their
remarks
at
this
point
in
the
record
;
;

The
speaker
pro
tempore
.

Is
there
objection
to
the
request
of
the
gentleman
from
Massachusetts
?
?

I
purposely
refrained
from
adding
the
usual
distinction
of
saying
that
he
was
from
the
State
of
Texas
.

Remarks
of
Hon.
Wayne
L.
Hays
of
Ohio

It
is
a
matter
of
deep
personal
satisfaction
for
me
to
add
my
voice
to
the
great
and
distinguished
chorus
of
my
colleagues
in
this
paean
of
praise
,
respect
,
and
affection
for
Speaker
Sam
Rayburn
.

Here
briefly
in
this
humble
tribute
I
have
sought
for
some
simple
and
succinct
summation
that
would
define
the
immense
service
of
this
patriot
to
his
country
.

What
Sam
Rayburn's
life
proves
to
us
all
is
the
magnificent
lesson
in
political
science
that
one
can
devotedly
and
with
absolute
dedication
represent
the
seemingly
provincial
interests
of
one's
own
community
,
one's
own
district
,
one's
own
State
,
and
by
that
help
himself
represent
even
better
the
sweep
and
scope
of
the
problems
of
this
the
greatest
nation
of
all
time
.

Through
the
most
rancorous
battles
of
political
controversy
and
the
most
bitterly
fought
national
and
presidential
campaigns
his
character
shines
as
an
example
of
dignity
and
honesty
,
forthrightness
and
nobility
.

This
means
much
to
the
American
tradition
.

It
is
,
I
insist
,
hard
to
define
the
Rayburn
contribution
to
our
political
civilization
because
it
is
so
massive
and
so
widespread
and
so
complicated
,
and
because
it
goes
so
deep
.

And
Sam
Rayburn
is
a
great
man
--
one
who
will
go
down
in
American
history
as
a
truly
great
leader
of
the
Nation
.

Sam
Rayburn
is
one
of
the
greatest
American
public
figures
in
the
history
of
our
country
and
I
consider
that
I
have
been
singly
honored
in
the
privilege
of
knowing
Sam
Rayburn
and
sharing
with
him
the
rights
and
obligations
of
a
Member
of
the
House
of
Representatives
in
the
Congress
of
the
United
States
.

Unit
prices
to
the
state
are
considerably
lower
than
to
the
general
public
because
of
quantity
purchases
and
no
payment
of
state
sales
or
federal
excise
taxes
.

Vehicle
purchase
,
assignment
and
use
policies
.

The
factors
governing
need
and
assignment
of
cars
are
flexible
according
to
circumstances
.

Unsuccessful
efforts
have
been
made
to
replace
high
mileage
allowances
with
state
automobiles
.

(

(

Rhode
Island's
reimburseable
rate
of
$.07
per
mile
for
use
of
personally-owned
cars
compares
favorably
with
other
states'
rates
.

Rhode
Island's
rate
of
$.07
per
mile
is
considerably
lower
than
reimburseable
rates
in
the
federal
government
and
in
industry
nationally
which
approximate
a
$.09
per
mile
average
.

Fixed
monthly
allowances
are
a
controversial
subject
.

Travel
allowances
.

In
the
past
twenty
years
the
ratio
of
state-owned
automobiles
per
state
employees
has
varied
from
1
to
22
then
to
1
to
23
now
.

History
and
operation
of
the
motor
pool
.

Prior
to
1942
,
automobiles
were
the
individual
responsibility
of
the
agency
to
which
assigned
.

It
embraced
determining
when
to
purchase
and
when
to
trade
vehicles
,
who
was
to
drive
,
when
and
where
repairs
were
to
be
made
,
where
gasoline
and
automobile
services
were
to
be
obtained
and
other
allied
matters
.

Whereas
the
maintenance
rotary
fund
had
in
the
past
sustained
losses
considerably
beyond
expectations
,
the
introduction
of
the
cost-billing
system
plus
other
control
refinements
has
resulted
in
keeping
the
fund
on
a
proper
working
basis
.

In
order
to
further
refine
the
management
of
passenger
vehicles
,
on
July
1
,
1958
,
the
actual
title
to
every
vehicle
was
transferred
,
by
Executive
Order
,
to
the
Division
of
Methods
,
Research
and
Office
Services
.

This
tied
in
closely
with
the
current
attempt
to
upgrade
state-owned
cars
to
the
extent
that
vehicles
are
not
retained
beyond
the
point
where
maintenance
costs
(
in
light
of
depreciation
)
become
excessive
.

for
example
,
if
one
driver
puts
on
22,000
miles
per
year
and
another
driver
8,000
miles
per
year
,
their
cars
will
be
switched
so
that
both
cars
will
have
30,000
miles
after
two
years
,
rather
than
44,000
miles
(
and
related
higher
maintenance
costs
)
and
16,000
miles
respectively
''
.

The
motor
pool
is
a
completely
centralized
and
mechanized
operation
.

It
handles
all
types
of
vehicle
maintenance
,
but
concentrates
more
on
``
service
station
activities
''
than
on
extensive
vehicle
repairs
.

It
contracts
with
outside
repair
garages
for
much
of
the
latter
work
.

One
matter
of
concern
to
the
complete
effectiveness
of
pool
operations
is
the
lack
of
adequate
central
garage
facilities
.

Purchasing
practices
.

The
purchase
of
state-owned
vehicles
is
handled
in
the
same
manner
as
all
other
purchases
of
the
state
.

Requests
are
made
by
the
motor
pool
along
with
any
necessary
cooperation
from
the
agencies
to
which
assignments
of
cars
will
be
made
.

Probably
the
most
important
of
all
matters
for
review
are
the
broad
administrative
policies
governing
the
purchase
,
assignment
,
use
,
and
management
of
state
vehicles
.

It
also
provides
for
the
taxation
of
all
personal
property
,
belonging
to
inhabitants
of
the
state
,
both
tangible
and
intangible
,
and
the
tangible
personal
property
of
non-residents
in
this
state
.

Intangible
property
is
taxable
wherever
the
owner
has
a
place
of
abode
the
greater
portion
of
the
year
.

The
Rhode
Island
Public
Expenditure
Council
in
its
publication
once
commented
:
``

The
resulting
setup
,
it
was
declared
,
``
would
be
similar
to
that
which
is
in
successful
operation
in
a
number
of
metropolitan
counties
as
large
or
larger
than
Rhode
Island
''
.

To
determine
the
practice
and
attitude
of
municipal
governments
concerning
tangible
movable
property
,
a
questionnaire
was
sent
to
all
local
government
assessors
or
boards
of
assessors
in
Rhode
Island
.

The
wording
of
the
question
was
quite
general
and
may
have
been
subject
to
different
interpretations
.

It
is
difficult
to
tabulate
exactly
what
was
meant
in
each
individual
situation
,
but
the
conclusion
may
be
drawn
that
21
towns
do
not
assess
movable
personal
property
,
and
of
the
remainder
only
certain
types
are
valued
for
tax
purposes
.

Fifteen
stated
that
it
was
according
to
location
,
four
by
residence
of
the
owner
,
and
nineteen
did
not
answer
.

Boats
as
personal
property

It
has
been
obvious
to
the
assessors
,
particularly
those
in
shore
communities
,
that
boats
comprise
the
largest
category
of
tangible
personal
property
which
they
have
been
unable
to
reach
.

Through
their
professional
organization
,
the
Rhode
Island
Tax
Officials
Association
the
question
of
taxing
boats
long
has
been
debated
and
discussed
.

Only
a
few
more
than
10,000
boats
had
been
registered
with
the
Division
of
Harbors
and
Rivers
at
the
end
of
the
1960
boating
season
,
but
many
had
been
taken
out
of
the
water
early
when
the
threat
of
a
hurricane
brought
the
season
to
an
early
close
.

Fifty-two
companies
started
or
committed
themselves
to
new
plant
construction
,
totaling
1,418,000
square
feet
and
representing
an
investment
of
$11,900,000

information
concerning
patents
,
copyrights
and
trade
marks
,
availability
of
technical
reports
,
and
other
subjects
of
interest
to
small
business
.

We
also
continued
to
run
a
series
of
ads
featuring
endorsement
of
Rhode
Island
by
industrialists
who
had
recently
established
new
plants
here
.

To
reach
a
still
greater
audience
of
location-minded
manufacturers
,
our
industrial
advertising
budget
for
the
fiscal
year
was
increased
from
$32,000
to
$40,000
,
and
the
Industrial
Building
Authority's
financial
participation
was
upped
from
$17,000
to
$20,000
.

Newspaper
advertising
was
mainly
concentrated
in
the
New
York
Times
and
the
Wall
Street
Journal
(
Eastern
and
Midwestern
editions
)
which
averaged
two
prominent
ads
per
month
,
and
to
a
lesser
degree
the
New
York
Herald
Tribune
and
,
for
the
west
coast
,
the
Los
Angeles
Times
and
the
Wall
Street
Journal
(
Pacific
Coast
edition
)
.

The
direct
mail
campaign
consisted
of
3
intra-state
mailings
of
1680
letters
each
and
6
out-of-state
directed
to
electronics
,
plastics
,
pharmaceutical
,
and
business
machine
manufacturers
,
and
to
publishers
.

These
totaled
6,768
pieces
of
correspondence
.

More
than
25
carefully
selected
cities
were
visited
,
including
New
York
,
Brooklyn
,
Long
Island
City
,
Newark
,
Elizabeth
,
Stamford
,
Waterbury
,
New
Haven
,
Bridgeport
,
Boston
,
Cambridge
,
Worcester
,
and
Waltham
.

Out
of
a
total
of
603
calls
,
452
contacts
were
established
with
top
executive
personnel
.

During
1960
,
two
important
conferences
were
organized
by
the
Development
Council's
Industrial
Division
.

Morning
sessions
included
addresses
by
Ward
Miller
,
Jr.
of
the
U.
S.
Dept.
of
Commerce
.

Two
years
ago
,
the
Institute
of
Public
Administration
issued
an
extremely
comprehensive
report
entitled
``
State-Local
Relations
In
Metropolitan
Rhode
Island
.

(

(

)

The
state
development
budget
will
reflect
the
capital
needs
of
all
the
state
agencies
and
the
priority
of
the
projects
in
the
budget
will
be
based
on
the
state
plan
.

The
long-range
aspects
of
this
program
are
divided
into
four
distinct
phases
:
basic
mapping
,
inventory
,
analysis
and
plan
and
policy
formation
.

With
these
maps
completed
,
the
inventory
phase
of
the
plan
has
been
started
.

This
phase
consists
of
four
items
:
urban
land
use
,
rural
land
use
,
physical
features
and
public
utility
service
areas
.

The
rural
land
use
study
is
being
carried
out
under
contract
by
the
University
of
Rhode
Island
and
identifies
all
agricultural
land
uses
in
the
state
by
type
of
use
.

These
forty-seven
special
purpose
governments
have
the
authority
to
levy
taxes
,
to
borrow
money
,
own
property
,
sue
and
be
sued
,
and
in
general
to
exercise
normal
corporate
powers
.

In
addition
to
the
collection
of
service
charges
,
the
special
districts
levy
annual
property
taxes
of
approximately
$450,000
.

Fiscal
uniformity
:
advantages
and
disadvantages

He
listed
among
the
values
of
fiscal
uniformity
:
1
.

The
uniform
fiscal
year
promotes
more
careful
budgeting
and
strengthens
control
over
expenditures
.

The
uniform
fiscal
year
brings
the
town's
fiscal
year
into
line
with
that
of
the
schools
,
which
expend
the
largest
share
of
local
disbursements
.

Furthermore
,
tax
collections
not
immediately
needed
for
current
expenditures
may
be
invested
in
short-term
treasury
notes
,
augmenting
the
town's
miscellaneous
revenues
and
reducing
the
tax
levy
.

Borrowing
in
anticipation
of
current
taxes
and
other
revenues
is
a
routine
procedure
of
the
majority
of
municipalities
at
all
times
.

This
type
of
borrowing
can
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
if
quarterly
installment
payment
of
taxes
is
instituted
and
the
first
payment
placed
near
the
opening
of
the
fiscal
year
.

Both
the
federal
and
state
governments
commence
their
fiscal
years
on
July
1
.

These
involve
more
the
mechanics
employed
in
adjusting
to
fiscal
uniformity
than
they
do
actual
disadvantages
to
the
principle
.

One
problem
is
a
matter
of
shifting
dates
;
;

Twelve
cities
and
towns
in
Rhode
Island
presently
indicate
some
plans
to
establish
a
uniform
coordinated
fiscal
tax
year
calendar
.

An
analysis
of
the
fiscal
tax
collection
year
calendars
throughout
the
state
indicates
that
transition
may
not
be
as
painful
as
is
commonly
thought
.

These
municipalities
include
:
Barrington
,
Lincoln
,
Middletown
,
Newport
,
North
Kingstown
,
and
South
Kingstown
.

These
three
installment
dates
would
be
:
October
26
,
January
26
,
and
April
25
(
Providence
)
and
November
15
,
February
16
and
May
15
(
Cranston
)
.

Assuming
an
adjustment
to
the
July
1
to
June
30
fiscal
year
,
the
required
adjustment
of
the
tax
collection
years
and
the
towns
involved
are
shown
in
Table
3
.

It
should
be
emphasized
strongly
that
adjustments
in
fiscal
dates
or
adoption
of
interim
budgets
do
not
necessarily
mean
financing
over
and
above
normal
governmental
requirements
.

Suitable
plans
range
from
those
that
are
very
easy
to
develop
to
those
that
are
difficult
to
formulate
and
require
borrowing
ranging
from
short-term
serial
notes
to
long-term
bonds
.

For
those
communities
which
have
financial
difficulties
in
effecting
adjustments
,
there
are
a
number
of
alternatives
any
one
of
which
alone
,
or
in
combination
with
others
,
would
minimize
if
not
even
eliminate
the
problem
.

and
now
,
therefore
,
do
I
,
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
governor
of
the
State
of
Rhode
Island
and
Providence
Plantations
,
proclaim
the
week
of
april
29th
to
may
7th
,
1961
,
as
Rhode
Island
Heritage
Week
,
advising
our
citizens
that
throughout
this
week
many
historic
houses
and
beautiful
gardens
will
be
open
to
visitors
as
well
as
industrial
plants
,
craft
shops
,
museums
and
libraries
and
I
earnestly
urge
all
to
take
advantage
of
these
opportunities
to
see
as
many
of
these
places
as
they
can
during
this
outstanding
week
.

Governor

The
State
Ballet
of
Rhode
Island
Week
proclamation
by
John
A.
Notte
,
Jr.
,
Governor

The
ballet
originated
in
Italy
about
1450
.

At
that
time
it
was
a
series
of
sophisticated
social
dances
whose
steps
were
often
combined
with
other
steps
devised
by
the
choreographer
.

They
were
placed
either
in
the
middle
of
the
acts
or
in
the
intermissions
.

In
testimony
whereof
,
I
have

The
American
Registry
Of
Pathology

The
staff
utilized
the
collected
material
in
these
registries
for
numerous
lectures
to
national
and
international
meetings
,
exhibits
,
and
published
studies
.

During
this
period
,
7,827
teaching
sets
were
distributed
on
loan
.

Of
the
375
exhibits
(
of
all
types
)
shown
,
161
were
new
or
refurbished
.

Eighty-five
specimens
were
loaned
for
study
purposes
.

During
the
period
,
the
laboratory
rendered
centralized
macropathological
service
to
qualified
requesters
.

During
the
period
from
1
July
1960
through
31
January
1961
,
the
Medical
Museum
was
required
to
move
to
Temporary
Building
``
S
''
on
the
Mall
from
Chase
Hall
.

Throughout
the
period
and
during
the
movement
operation
,
the
Museum
continued
its
functional
support
of
the
Armed
Forces
Institute
of
Pathology
.

The
Armed
Forces
Medical
Publication
Agency
,
established
in
1949
,
has
published
,
since
January
1950
,
The
United
States
Armed
Forces
Medical
Journal
as
a
triservice
publication
to
furnish
material
of
professional
interest
to
Medical
Department
officers
of
the
three
military
services
.

Its
supplement
,
The
Medical
Technicians
Bulletin
,
supplied
similar
material
to
enlisted
medical
personnel
.

These
publications
replaced
the
U.
S.
Naval
Medical
Bulletin
,
published
continuously
from
1907
through
1959
,
as
well
as
the
Navy's
Hospital
Corps
Quarterly
and
the
Bulletin
of
the
U.
S.
Army
Medical
Department
,
published
from
1922
to
1949
.

From
1
July
1958
to
30
June
1960
,
24
numbers
of
the
Journal
and
nine
of
the
Bulletin
were
published
.

This
resulted
in
an
improved
appearance
,
but
was
followed
by
an
increase
in
printing
cost
that
necessitated
the
institution
of
major
economies
to
keep
within
the
total
of
allocated
funds
.

The
use
of
100
instead
of
140
substance
paper
plus
the
adoption
of
side
stapling
beginning
with
the
May
1960
issue
reduced
costs
sufficiently
to
allow
completion
of
the
fiscal
year
with
nearly
$4,000
in
unexpended
funds
.

The
Armed
Forces
Epidemiological
Board
agreed
to
submit
each
month
a
report
for
one
of
its
12
commissions
,
so
that
each
commission
will
report
once
a
year
on
some
phase
of
its
work
calculated
to
be
of
particular
interest
and
value
to
medical
officers
of
the
Armed
Forces
.

In
one
of
these
,
an
exploding-wire
device
to
study
systems
thermodynamically
up
to
6,000
Af
and
100
atmospheres
pressure
,
a
major
goal
was
achieved
.

The
method
of
calibration
employs
a
fixed
resistance
element
as
a
calorimeter
.

The
element
is
inserted
in
the
discharge
circuit
in
place
of
the
exploding
wire
,
and
the
calorimetric
heating
of
the
element
is
measured
with
high
accuracy
.

A
high-speed
shutter
has
been
developed
in
order
to
permit
photographic
observation
of
any
portion
of
the
electrical
wire
explosion
.

The
opening
action
is
obtained
when
a
capacitor
,
charged
to
high
voltage
,
is
suddenly
discharged
through
the
foil
.

Experiments
have
shown
that
the
shutter
is
75
percent
open
in
about
60-80
microseconds
.

The
shutter
aperture
may
be
made
larger
or
smaller
by
changing
the
foil
area
and
adjusting
the
electrical
energy
input
to
the
foil
.

Laboratory
measurements
of
interstellar
radio
spectra
.

Besides
the
well-known
hydrogen
line
at
21
cm
wavelength
,
the
spectra
of
extraterrestrial
radio
sources
may
contain
sharp
lines
characteristic
of
other
atoms
,
ions
,
and
small
molecules
.

Very
small
concentrations
of
these
hydrides
should
be
detectable
;
;

High
sensitivity
in
radio
telescopes
is
achieved
by
reducing
the
bandwidth
of
the
receiver
;
;

This
involves
the
application
of
a
strong
magnetic
field
to
the
radical
vapor
,
which
shifts
the
low-frequency
spectra
to
a
conveniently
high
microwave
range
,
where
they
may
be
measured
with
optimum
sensitivity
.

extraterrestrial
observations
have
yet
to
be
reported
.

The
efforts
and
accomplishments
fall
into
three
main
categories
:
absolute
thermometry
based
upon
the
velocity
of
sound
in
helium
gas
,
secondary
thermometry
involving
principally
studies
of
the
behavior
of
germanium
resistors
,
and
helium-4
vapor-pressure
measurements
(
see
p.
144
)
.

An
acoustical
interferometer
has
been
constructed
and
used
,
with
helium
gas
as
the
thermometric
fluid
,
to
measure
temperatures
near
4.2
and
2.1
Af
.

When
values
of
temperature
derived
with
this
instrument
were
compared
with
the
accepted
values
associated
with
liquid
helium-4
vapor
pressures
,
differences
of
about
10
and
7
millidegrees
respectively
were
found
.

Resistance
thermometers
.

Preliminary
calibrations
of
the
resistors
have
been
made
from
4.21
to
2.16
Af
at
every
0.1
Af
.

and
for
the
third
resistor
,
3.3
millidegrees
.

Vapor
pressure
method
.

Pressure
transducer
for
pvt
measurements
.

Precise
pressure-volume-temperature
measurements
on
corrosive
gases
are
dependent
on
a
sensitive
yet
rugged
pressure
transducer
.

The
transducer
is
a
null-type
instrument
and
employs
a
stretched
diaphragm
,
0.001
in.
thick
and
1
in.
in
diameter
.

In
March
,
1961
,
representatives
of
the
national
laboratories
of
Australia
,
Canada
,
The
Netherlands
,
United
Kingdom
,
U.S.S.R.
,
United
States
,
and
West
Germany
,
met
at
the
NBS
to
devise
means
for
reaching
international
agreement
on
a
temperature
scale
between
10
and
90
Af
.

In
addition
to
the
basic
programs
in
wavelength
standards
,
spectroscopy
,
solid
state
physics
,
interactions
of
the
free
electron
and
atomic
constants
which
are
necessary
to
provide
the
foundation
for

the
Bureau
has
strengthened
its
activities
in

the

tanks
on

beaches
and
Russian
Mig
jet
fighters
strafing
rebel

brought
home
to
all
of

the
stark
,
blunt
truth
of
what
it
means
to
have
a
Russian
military
base
90
miles
away
from
home
.

For
years
the
United
States
had
been
trying
to
get
these
countries
to
exclude
Castro's
representative
from
secret
military
talks
.

Blockade
is
one
answer
offered
by
experts
.

In
it
they
see
a
way
to
isolate
Cuba
,
stop
infiltration
,
maybe
finish
Castro
,
too
.

It
could
halt
a
flood
of
Communist
arms
and
strategic
supplies
now
reaching
Castro
.

It
could
stop
Cuban
re-export
of
guns
and
propaganda
materials
to
South
America

The

At

is
rested
on

are
nailed
to
the

by
reaching
up
through
the
open
space

Work
on
the
roof
continues
in
this
way
.

The
structure
is
complete
.

Solid
concrete
blocks
,
relatively
heavy
and
dense
,
are
used
for
this
shelter
.

These
blocks
are
sold
in
various
sizes
so
it
seldom
is
necessary
to
cut
a
block
to
fit
.

The

is
a
6-inch
slab
of
reinforced
concrete
,
covered
with
at
least
20
inches
of
pit-run

.

It
would
have
to
be
covered
with
at
least
28
inches
of

for

Materials
for

A
contractor
probably
would
be
required
to
help
build
it
.

This

The

must
have

Radiation
scatters
somewhat
like

.

A
blower
is
essential
for
the
double-wall
shelter
and
for
the
underground
shelters
.

Radio
reception
is
cut
down
by
the
shielding
necessary
to
keep
out
radiation
.

Basement
walls
that
project
above
the
ground
should
be
shielded
as
shown
in
the
Appendix
,
page

.

Bunks
,
or
materials
to
build
them
,
may
have
to
be
put
inside
the
enclosure
before
the
shelter
walls
are
completed
.

But
the
radiation
may
be
so
intense
at
the
start
that
one
percent
may
be
extremely
dangerous
.

Families
with
children
will
have
particular
problems
.

There
should
be
a
task
for
everyone
and
these
tasks
should
be
rotated
.

However
,
as
much
time
as
possible
should
be
spent
within
the
shelter
to
hold
radiation
exposure
to
a
minimum
.

The
housekeeping
problems
of
living
in
a
shelter
will
begin
as
soon
as
the
shelter
is
occupied
.

After
the
family
has
settled
in
the
shelter
,
the
housekeeping
rules
should
be
spelled
out
by
the
adult
in
charge
.

A
covered
container
such
as
a
kitchen
garbage
pail
might
do
as
a
toilet
.

In
general
,
such
apartments
afford
more
protection
than
smaller
buildings
because
their
walls
are
thick
and
there
is
more
space
.

The
basement
of
such
an
apartment
building
may
provide
as
much
natural
protection
as
the
specially
constructed
concrete
block
shelter
recommended
for
the
basement
of
a
family
dwelling
.

Lines
of
communications
were
established
between
the
two
companies
and
several
Du
Pont
products
were
actively
promoted
.

The
Fisher
Body
division
,
long
controlled
by
the
Fisher
brothers
under
a
voting
trust
even
though
General
Motors
owned
a
majority
of
its
stock
,
followed
an
independent
course
for
many
years
,
but
by
1947
and
1948
``
resistance
had
collapsed
''
and
its
purchases
from
Du
Pont
``
compared
favorably
''
with
purchases
by
other
General
Motors
divisions
.

The
fact
that
sticks
out
in
this
voluminous
record
is
that
the
bulk
of
Du
Pont's
production
has
always
supplied
the
largest
part
of
the
requirements
of
the
one
customer
in
the
automobile
industry
connected
to
Du
Pont
by
a
stock
interest
.

However
,
it
determined
that
neither
this
factor
,
nor
``
the
fact
that
all
concerned
in
high
executive
posts
in
both
companies
acted
honorably
and
fairly
,
each
in
the
honest
conviction
that
his
actions
were
in
the
best
interests
of
his
own
company
and
without
any
design
to
overreach
anyone
,
including
Du
Pont's
competitors
''
,
outweighed
the
Government's
claim
for
relief
.

No
corporation
engaged
in
commerce
shall
acquire
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
stock
or
other
share
capital
of
another
corporation
engaged
also
in
commerce
,
where
the
effect
of
such
acquisition
may
be
to
substantially
lessen
competition
between
the
corporation
whose
stock
is
so
acquired
and
the
corporation
making
the
acquisition
,
or
to
restrain
such
commerce
in
any
section
or
community
,
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
of
any
line
of
commerce
.

The
purpose
of
this
provision
was
thus
explained
in
the
Court's
opinion
:
``

Indeed
,
as
already
noted
,
the
Court
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
the
executives
involved
in
the
dealings
between
Du
Pont
and
General
Motors
acted
``
honorably
and
fairly
''
and
exercised
their
business
judgment
only
to
serve
what
they
deemed
the
best
interests
of
their
own
companies
.

and
that
competition
for
this
share
of
the
market
was
endangered
by
the
financial
relationship
between
the
two
concerns
:
``

We
repeat
,
that
the
test
of
a
violation
of
7
is
whether
,
at
the
time
of
suit
,
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
acquisition
is
likely
to
result
in
the
condemned
restraints
.

On
the
basis
of
the
findings
which
led
to
this
conclusion
,
the
Court
remanded
the
case
to
the
District
Court
to
determine
the
appropriate
relief
.

The
judgment
must
therefore
be
reversed
and
the
cause
remanded
to
the
District
Court
for
a
determination
,
after
further
hearing
,
of
the
equitable
relief
necessary
and
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
the
acquisition
offensive
to
the
statute

The
first
pretrial
conference
--
held
to
appoint
amici
curiae
to
represent
the
interest
of
the
stockholders
of
Du
Pont
and
General
Motors
and
to
consider
the
procedure
to
be
followed
in
the
subsequent
hearings
--
took
place
on
September
25
,
1957
.

On
May
9
,
1958
,
the
Commissioner
announced
his
rulings
.

The
forced
sale
of
the
General
Motors
stock
owned
by
or
allocable
to
Christiana
,
Delaware
,
and
the
stockholders
of
Delaware
,
and
deposited
with
the
trustee
,
would
result
in
a
tax
to
those
parties
at
the
capital
gains
rate
.

It
argued
,
inter
alia
,
that
a
divestiture
order
would
severely
depress
the
market
value
of
the
stock
of
both
General
Motors
and
Du
Pont
,
with
consequent
serious
loss
and
hardship
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
innocent
investors
,
among
them
thousands
of
small
trusts
and
charitable
institutions
;
;

The
decrees
proposed
by
the
amici
curiae
were
filed
in
August
of
1958
.

Both
plans
also
prohibited
common
directors
,
officers
,
or
employees
between
Du
Pont
,
Christiana
,
and
Delaware
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
General
Motors
on
the
other
.

One
of
these
is
the
solidarity
and
the
confidential
relationship
of
marriage
.

The
Court's
opinion
dogmatically
asserts
that
the
husband-wife
conspiracy
doctrine
does
not
in
fact
protect
this
relationship
,
and
that
hence
the
doctrine
``
enthrones
an
unreality
into
a
rule
of
law
''
.

Pp.

.

The
trial
judge
decided
that
the
administrative
procedures
of
the
Act
were
fully
complied
with
and
refused
to
require
the
production
of
such
documents
.

He
claimed
4-d
classification
as
a
minister
of
religion
,
devoting
a
minimum
of
100
hours
a
month
to
preaching
.

On
November
22
,
1952
,
he
wrote
the
Board
,
protesting
this
classification
.

that
he
was
``
devoting
an
average
of
100
hours
a
month
to
actual
preaching
publicly
''
,
in
addition
to
50
to
75
hours
in
other
ministerial
duties
,
and
that
he
opposed
war
in
any
form
.

It
reported
that
he
now
devoted
only
some
hours
per
month
to
public
preaching
and
from
20
to
25
hours
per
month
to
church
activities
.

His
claim
was
therefore
``
so
highly
exaggerated
''
,
the
Department
concluded
,
that
it
``
cast
doubt
upon
his
veracity
and
,
consequently
,
upon
his
sincerity
and
good
faith
''
.

In
his
answer
thereto
,
he
advised
the
Board
that
he
had
made
no
such
statement
in
1956
,
and
asserted
that
his
only
claim
to
``
pioneering
''
was
in
1952
.

Apparently
he
never
took
the
trouble
to
find
out
.

We
said
there
that
it
was
necessary
``
that
a
registrant
be
given
an
opportunity
to
rebut
(
the
Department's
)
recommendation
when
it
comes
to
the
Appeal
Board
,
the
agency
with
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
classification

''
.

But
there
are
other
contentions
which
might
be
considered
more
difficult
.

He
alleged
no
specific
procedural
errors
or
evidence
withheld
;
;

It
is
not
essentially
different
from
a
memorandum
of
an
attorney
in
the
Department
of
Justice
,
of
which
the
Attorney
General
receives
many
,
and
to
which
he
may
give
his
approval
or
rejection
.

While
there
are
now
allegations
of
the
withholding
of
``
favorable
evidence
developed
at
the
hearing
''
and
a
denial
of
a
``
full
and
fair
hearing
''
,
no
such
claim
was
made
by
petitioner
at
any
stage
of
the
administrative
process
.

Moreover
,
his
testimony
at
trial
never
developed
any
such
facts
.

He
bases
his
present
contention
on
the
general
right
to
explore
,
indicating
that
he
hopes
to
find
some
discrepancy
in
the
resume
.

346
U.S.
,
at
5-6
.

Even
if
we
were
not
bound
by
Nugent
,
petitioner
here
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
report
.

We
cannot
regard
foreign
policy
as
something
left
over
after
defense
policy
or
trade
policy
or
fiscal
policy
has
been
extracted
.

If
the
Department
of
State
is
to
take
primary
responsibility
for
foreign
policy
in
Washington
,
it
follows
that
the
ambassador
is
expected
to
take
charge
overseas
.

He
is
expected
to
know
about
what
is
going
on
among
the
representatives
of
other
agencies
who
are
stationed
in
his
country
.

If
any
official
operation
abroad
begins
to
go
wrong
,
we
shall
look
to
the
ambassador
to
find
out
why
and
to
get
suggestions
for
remedial
action
.

If
action
is
indicated
,
what
kind
of
action
is
relevant
to
the
problem
?
?

Is
the
matter
one
for
the
United
Nations
or
some
other
international
body
?
?

What
type
of
action
can
hope
to
win
public
support
,
first
in
this
country
and
then
abroad
?
?

We
do
not
want
policy
officers
below
the
level
of
Presidential
appointees
to
concern
themselves
too
much
with
problems
of
domestic
politics
in
recommending
foreign
policy
action
.

Mr.
Truman
emphasized
this
point
by
saying
,
``
You
fellows
in
the
Department
of
State
don't
know
much
about
domestic
politics
''
.

This
is
an
important
consideration
.

The
Peace
Corps
should
not
pay
the
expenses
of
a
wife
or
family
,
unless
the
wife
is
also
accepted
for
full-time
Peace
Corps
work
on
the
same
project
.

In
most
cases
service
in
the
Corps
will
probably
be
considered
a
ground
for
temporary
deferment
.

Nor
would
it
be
possible
in
many
cases
for
them
to
live
in
health
or
any
effectiveness
on
what
their
counterparts
abroad
are
paid
.

The
guiding
principle
indeed
should
not
be
anything
like
compensation
for
individual
services
.

For
readjustment
to
the
U.S.
,
volunteers
should
be
given
some
separation
allowance
at
the
end
of
their
overseas
service
,
based
on
the
length
of
time
served
.

For
this
,
the
Peace
Corps
should
be
administered
by
a
small
,
new
,
alive
agency
operating
as
one
component
in
our
whole
overseas
operation
.

Nor
should
we
lose
the
opportunity
to
use
this
summer
for
training
on
university
campuses
.

It
can
then
grow
steadily
as
it
proves
itself
and
as
the
need
for
it
is
demonstrated
.

What
would
the
first
projects
be
?
?

The
need
here
is
most
clearly
felt
and
our
capacity
to
recruit
and
train
qualified
volunteers
in
a
short
period
of
time
is
greatest
.

A
certain
skepticism
about
the
coming
of
Americans
is
to
be
expected
in
many
quarters
.

The
Peace
Corps
is
not
a
diplomatic
or
propaganda
venture
but
a
genuine
experiment
in
international
partnership
.

The
Peace
Corps
offers
an
opportunity
to
bring
home
to
the
United
States
the
problems
of
the
world
as
well
as
an
opportunity
to
meet
urgent
host
country
needs
for
trained
manpower
.

How
will
it
be
financed
?
?

Congress
should
then
be
asked
to
give
the
Peace
Corps
a
firm
legislative
foundation
for
the
next
fiscal
year
.

For
this
must
be
the
project
of
the
whole
American
people
.

No
matter
how
well
conceived
and
efficiently
run
,
there
probably
will
be
failures
.

With
colleges
and
universities
carrying
a
large
part
of
the
program
,
and
with
students
looking
toward
Peace
Corps
service
,
there
will
be
an
impact
on
educational
curriculum
and
student
seriousness
.

And
this
is
meeting
the
world's
need
,
too
,
since
what
the
world
most
needs
from
this
country
is
better
understanding
of
the
world
.

I
recommend
to
the
Congress
the
establishment
of
a
permanent
Peace
Corps
--
a
pool
of
trained
American
men
and
women
sent
overseas
by
the
U.S.
Government
or
through
private
organizations
and
institutions
to
help
foreign
countries
meet
their
urgent
needs
for
skilled
manpower
.

This
organization
will
differ
from
existing
assistance
programs
in
that
its
members
will
supplement
technical
advisers
by
offering
the
specific
skills
needed
by
developing
nations
if
they
are
to
put
technical
advice
to
work
.

They
will
help
provide
the
skilled
manpower
necessary
to
carry
out
the
development
projects
planned
by
the
host
governments
,
acting
at
a
working
level
and
serving
at
great
personal
sacrifice
.

widespread
damage
;
;

An
additional
15
million
acres
will
be
given
a
lesser
degree
of
protection
but
adequate
to
meet
the
average
fire
situation
.

Expansion
,
modernization

and
development

fire
control
to
a
proficiency
and
strength
of
force
which
will
prevent
as
many
fires
as
possible
and
suppress
fires
before
they
spread
beyond
permitted
standards
.

This
will
include
a
stepped-up
program
of
training
and
development
of
personnel
.

.

Control
would
be
limited
to
those
rodents
for
which
economical
means
of
control
are
known
.

It
is
estimated
that
about
542,250
miles
of
forest
development
roads
,
and
80,000
miles
of
trails
,
constitute
the
system
that
will
eventually
be
needed
to
obtain
the
maximum
practicable
yield
and
use
of
the
wood
,
water
,
forage
,
and
wildlife
and
recreation
resources
of
the
National
Forests
on
a
continuing
basis
.

It
will
be
carefully
planned
to
maintain
optimum
service
to
these
important
resources
and
watersheds
.

the
volume
of
timber
that
can
be
marketed
,
especially
for
small
sales
and
the
support
of
dependent
communities
and
small
business
enterprises
;
;

This
constitutes
about
17
percent
of
the
long-range
requirements
for
these
facilities
.

.

Within
the
units
in
the
National
Forest
System
the
pattern
of
land
ownership
is
quite
irregular
.

One
consequence
is
the
occurrence
of
occasional
conflicts
because
private
owners
of
some
inholdings
object
to
public
programs
of
use
on
neighboring
National
Forest
or
other
Federal
land
,
or
because
such
ownerships
are
developed
for
uses
that
are
not
compatible
with
use
for
the
public
of
neighboring
National
Forest
land
.

And
some
,
which
are
suitable
for
tree
growing
and
for
other
National
Forest
purposes
,
are
unmanaged
or
in
need
of
expensive
rehabilitation
,
and
are
contributing
nothing
to
the
economy
;
;

Lands
in
this
last
category
are
situated
largely
in
the
mountainous
portions
of
the
Eastern
States
.

--
This
budget
will
provide
in
the
fiscal
year
1961
for
the
continued
support
of
our
forces
at
approximately
the
present
level
--
a
year-end
strength
of
2,489,000
men
and
women
in
the
active
forces
.

If
the
reserve
components
are
to
serve
effectively
in
time
of
war
,
their
basic
organization
and
objectives
must
conform
to
the
changing
character
and
missions
of
the
active
forces
.

Quality
and
combat
readiness
must
take
precedence
over
mere
numbers
.

Last
year
the
Congress
discontinued
its
previously
imposed
minimum
personnel
strength
limitations
on
the
Army
Reserve
.

I
again
proposed
a
reduction
in
the
Army
National
Guard
and
Army
Reserve
--
from
their
present
strengths
of
400,000
and
300,000
,
respectively
,
to
360,000
and
270,000
by
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
1961
.

These
increased
costs
are
partially
offset
by
a
decrease
of
$56
million
in
expenditures
for
the
reserve
forces
,
largely
because
of
the
planned
reduction
in
strength
of
the
Army
Reserve
components
during
1961
.

Traditionally
,
rates
of
pay
for
retired
military
personnel
have
been
proportionate
to
current
rates
of
pay
for
active
personnel
.

The
increase
stems
largely
from
the
growing
complexity
of
and
higher
degree
of
maintenance
required
for
newer
weapons
and
equipment
.

A
substantial
increase
is
estimated
in
the
cost
of
operating
additional
communications
systems
in
the
air
defense
program
,
as
well
as
in
all
programs
where
speed
and
security
of
communications
are
essential
.

The
task
of
providing
a
reasonable
level
of
military
strength
,
without
endangering
other
vital
aspects
of
our
security
,
is
greatly
complicated
by
the
swift
pace
of
scientific
progress
.

Notable
in
this
category
are
the
Jupiter
and
Thor
intermediate
range
ballistic
missiles
,
which
have
been
successfully
developed
,
produced
,
and
deployed
,
but
the
relative
importance
of
which
has
diminished
with
the
increasing
availability
of
the
Atlas
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
.

--
The
deterrent
power
of
our
Armed
Forces
comes
from
both
their
nuclear
retaliatory
capability
and
their
capability
to
conduct
other
essential
operations
in
any
form
of
war
.

The
second
capability
is
represented
by
our
deployed
ground
,
naval
,
and
air
forces
in
essential
forward
areas
,
together
with
ready
reserves
capable
of
effecting
early
emergency
reinforcement
.

This
aircraft
,
which
was
planned
for
initial
operational
use
about
1965
,
would
be
complementary
to
but
likewise
competitive
with
the
four
strategic
ballistic
missile
systems
,
all
of
which
are
scheduled
to
become
available
earlier
.

By
that
time
we
should
be
in
a
much
better
position
to
determine
the
value
of
that
aircraft
as
a
weapon
system
.

Funds
are
also
included
in
this
budget
to
continue
the
equipping
of
the
B-52
wings
with
the
Hound
Dog
air-to-surface
missile
.

In
the
coming
fiscal
year
additional
quantities
of
Atlas
,
Titan
,
and
Polaris
missiles
also
will
be
procured
.

At
that
time
consideration
will
be
given
to
whether
in
the
light
of
the
United
States
supplies
of
rice
available
for
Title
1
,
disposal
,
India's
production
,
consumption
and
stocks
of
food
grains
,
other
imports
from
the
United
States
and
countries
friendly
to
the
United
States
,
India's
storage
capacity
,
and
other
related
factors
,
any
increase
would
be
possible
in
the
portion
of
the
total
rice
programmed
which
is
currently
planned
for
procurement
during
the
first
year
.

to
state
that
the
understanding

is
as
follows
:

The
Government
of
India
will
provide

of
the
rupee
equivalent
of
$4
million
(
up
to
a

The
Secretary

India
,
and
the
President

The
interest

will
be
similar
to
those
prevailing
in
India
on
comparable
loans
and
the
maturities
will
be
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
financing
.

Within
sixty
days
after
the
receipt
of
notice
that
the
Export-Import
Bank
is
prepared
to
act
favorably
upon
an
application
the

indicate
to
the
Export-Import
Bank
whether
or
not
the
Department
of
Economic
Affairs
has
any
objection
to
the
proposed
loan
.

The
Government
of
India
further
agrees
in
cooperation
with
the
Government
of
the
United

,
to
coordinate
the
use
of
grant

so
that
both

With
regard
to
the
rupees
accruing
to
uses
indicated
under
Article
2
,
of
the
Agreement
,
the
understanding
of
the
Government
of
the
United
States
of
America
,
with
respect
to
both
paragraphs
1
(
B
)
and
1
(
C
)
of
Article
2
,
is
as
follows
:
(
1
)

This
broad
delegation
leaves
within
our
discretion
(
subject
to
the
always-present
criterion
of
the
public
interest
)
both
the
determination
of
what
degree
of
interference
shall
be
considered
excessive
,
and
the
methods
by
which
such
excessive
interference
shall
be
avoided
.

An
example
of
the
overall
standards
applied
is
the
20-to-1
ratio
established
for
the
determination
of
that
degree
of
cochannel
interference
which
is
regarded
as
objectionable
.

A
second
fundamental
principle
is
that
involved
particularly
in
the
present
proceeding
--
the
difference
between
nighttime
and
daytime
propagation
conditions
with
respect
to
the
standard
broadcast
frequencies
.

But
during
nighttime
hours
the
skywave
radiations
are
reflected
from
the
ionosphere
,
thereby
creating
the
possibility
of
one
station's
rendering
service
,
via
skywave
,
at
a
much
greater
distance
than
it
can
through
its
groundwave
signal
,
and
at
the
same
time
vastly
complicating
the
interference
problem
because
of
the
still
greater
distance
over
which
these
skywave
signals
may
cause
interference
to
the
signals
of
stations
on
the
same
and
closely
adjacent
frequencies
.

(
2
)

(
3
)

Accordingly
,
the
Commission
has
recognized
that
an
optimum
allocation
pattern
for
one
frequency
does
not
necessarily
represent
the
best
pattern
for
other
frequencies
,
and
has
assigned
different
frequencies
for
use
by
different
classes
of
stations
.

The
class
1
,
stations
on
these
clear
channels
are
protected
to
their
groundwave
contours
against
daytime
cochannel
interference
.

In
the
allocation
pattern
worked
out
for
these
frequencies
,
the
provision
of
long-range
service
has
to
some
extent
been
subordinated
to
the
other
two
objectives
--
assignment
of
multiple
facilities
,
and
assignment
of
stations
in
as
many
communities
as
possible
.

8
.

During
nighttime
hours
,
because
of
the
intense
skywave
propagation
then
prevailing
,
no
large
number
of
stations
can
be
permitted
to
operate
on
one
of
these
channels
,
if
the
wide
area
service
for
which
these
frequencies
are
assigned
is
to
be
rendered
satisfactorily
by
the
dominant
stations
which
must
be
relied
upon
to
render
it
.

In
the
daytime
,
on
the
other
hand
,
since
skywave
transmission
is
relatively
inefficient
,
it
is
possible
to
assign
a
substantially
larger
number
of
stations
on
these
channels
.

Similarly
,
on
the
regional
channels
many
class
3
,
stations
have
been
assigned
either
to
operate
daytime
only
or
to
operate
nighttime
with
directional
antennas
lower
power
.

10
.

Since
then
,
there
has
been
a
notable
increase
in
the
number
of
stations
and
also
the
accumulation
of
additional
data
and
the
development
of
new
techniques
for
using
it
,
leading
to
a
better
understanding
of
propagation
phenomena
.

Chapter
38

achieving

the
bases
of
their
own
first-rate
accomplishments
in
their
different
fields
of
scholarship
and
the
arts
.

and
quality
of
advice
,
added
to
devotion
to
the
Foundation's
purposes
and
ideals
,
we
do
get
from
our
Advisory
Board
in
measures
so
full
that
they
can
be
appreciated
only
by
those
of
us
who
work
here
every
day
.

It
is
a
truism
of
business
that
no
business
can
be
better
than
its
board
of
directors
and
its
top
management
.

He
is
a
member
both
of
the
National
Academy
of
Sciences
and
of
the
American
Philosophical
Society
;
;

and
he
has
served
our
country
well
as
a
scientific
statesman
on
international
commissions
.

He
is
a
historian
,
with
the
great
merit
of
a
historian's
long
view
.

Also
appointed
to
the
Foundation's
staff
,
as
Assistant
Secretary
,
is
Mr.
J.
Kellum
Smith
,
Jr.
.

The
effective
recognition
of
excellence
and
its
nurture
has
to
be
learned
and
is
not
learned
in
a
day
,
nor
even
in
a
year
.

We
are
not
given
to
lamentations
,
neither
personally
nor
in
these
Reports
.

For
,
granting
that
there
are
great
present-day
problems
to
be
solved
,
these
problems
make
great
demands
;
;

and
by
their
demanding
tend
to
create
resources
of
men's
minds
and
hearts
which
problems
with
easy
answers
do
not
bring
forth
.

Of
this
,
examples
are
legion
:
Pericles
speaking
his
funeral
oration
in
Ancient
Greece's
extremity
after
Thermopylae
and
making
it
a
testament
of
freedom
;
;

Keats's
words
--
in
the
days
of
the
Spanish
Armada's
threats
;
;

indeed
,
the
contrary
has
happened
.

Hence
,
the
condition
of
freedom
is
a
necessary
condition
for
choice
.

For
change
is
dependent
on
the
possibilities
that
individual
men
glimpse
for
the
future

When
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
Manufacturing
Company
reached
its
125th
year
as
a
going
industrial
concern
during
1958
,
it
became
an
almost
unique
institution
in
the
mechanical
world
.

With
its
history
standing
astride
all
but
the
very
beginnings
of
the
industrial
revolution
,
Brown
&
Sharpe
has
become
over
the
years
a
singular
monument
to
the
mechanical
foresight
of
its
founder
,
Joseph
R.
Brown
,
and
a
world-renowned
synonym
for
precision
and
progress
in
metalworking
technology
.

He
was
early
exposed
to
the
mechanical
world
,
and
in
his
youth
often
helped
his
father
,
David
Brown
,
master
clock
and
watchmaker
,
as
he
plied
his
trade
.

This
enterprise
led
to
a
father-and-son
combination
beginning
in
1833
,
under
the
name
D.
Brown
&
Son
,
a
business
which
eventually
grew
into
the
modern
corporation
we
now
call
Brown
&
Sharpe
.

But
his
business
also
grew
,
and
we
are
told
that
Mr.
Brown
found
it
increasingly
difficult
to
devote
as
much
time
to
his
creative
thinking
as
his
inclinations
led
him
to
desire
.

Several
efforts
were
made
in
this
direction
,
and
though
not
all
of
them
survive
to
this
day
,
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
wire
gage
system
was
eventually
adopted
as
the
American
standard
and
is
still
in
common
use
today
.

The
new
work
was
a
boon
to
the
partnership
,
not
only
for
its
own
value
but
particularly
for
the
stimulation
it
provided
to
the
imagination
of
J.
R.
Brown
toward
yet
further
developments
for
production
equipment
.

This
process
neither
satisfied
the
urgent
production
schedules
nor
Mr.
Brown's
imagination
of
the
possibilities
in
the
situation
.

The
original
machine
,
bearing
its
famous
serial
number
,
is
still
on
exhibition
at
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
Precision
Center
in
Providence
.

Up
until
that
time
it
had
been
possible
to
make
cutters
for
making
gear
teeth
,
but
they
were
good
for
only
one
sharpening
.

Following
Mr.
Brown's
death
,
there
came
forward
in
the
Brown
&
Sharpe
organization
many
other
men
who
contributed
greatly
to
the
development
of
the
company
.

One
such
man
was
Samuel
Darling
.

As
head
of
the
firm
Darling
&
Swartz
,
Mr.
Darling
began
by
challenging
Brown
&
Sharpe
to
its
keenest
competition
during
the
1850's
and
early
60's
.

In
one
sense
it
can
be
said
that
one
of
the
most
important
Brown
&
Sharpe
products
over
the
years
has
been
the
men
who
began
work
with
the
company
and
subsequently
came
to
places
of
industrial
eminence
throughout
the
nation
and
even
abroad
.

Sales
and
other
operating
income
increased
25.1%
from
$24,926,615
in
1959
to
$31,179,816
in
1960
.

This
increase
was
sufficient
to
overcome
the
effect
on
net
income
of
higher
costs
of
manufacture
and
increased
expenditures
on
research
and
development
.

Need
for
sound
tax
policy

In
connection
with
our
continuing
development
of
new
and
more
efficient
mill
machinery
,
a
sounder
U.
S.
income
tax
policy
on
depreciation
of
production
equipment
,
enabling
the
mills
to
charge
off
the
cost
of
new
machines
on
a
more
realistic
basis
,
could
,
if
adopted
,
have
favorable
effects
on
Leesona's
business
in
the
next
few
years
.

Stretch
yarn
machines

In
December
we
began
to
ship
our
ultra-high-speed
stretch
yarn
machines
.

Fashion
centers
are
now
predicting
broad
acceptance
of
sports
apparel
and
improved
``
wash
and
wear
''
dresses
and
blouses
made
from
these
fabrics
.

The
Uniconer
has
several
outstanding
features
--
it
operates
with
much
greater
efficiency
than
existing
equipment
;
;

New
Unifil
application

There
is
a
rapidly
growing
demand
for
this
material
,
primarily
from
the
military
.

Further
research
,
we
believe
,
will
develop
important
commercial
applications
.

We
are
initiating
research
on
the
use
of
solid
state
materials
for
infrared
detection
using
a
method
which
will
not
require
cooling
of
materials
to
attain
high
sensitivity
.

The
building
will
contain
430,000
square
feet
,
approximately
the
same
as
our
present
plant
.

A
major
consideration
in
the
choice
of
the
Warwick
site
,
four
miles
from
Cranston
,
was
the
fact
that
it
permits
retention
of
our
present
trained
and
highly
skilled
work
force
.

British
subsidiary

Thus
we
enter
1961
in
a
strong
financial
position
.

In
addition
,
Blue
Cross
coverage
for
all
employees
and
their
dependents
was
extended
to
provide
the
full
cost
of
semi-private
hospital
accommodations
.

During
the
pension
year
ended
December
31
,
1960
,
23
employees
retired
,
making
a
total
of
171
currently
retired
under
the
Company's
pension
plan
.

As
in
many
other
industries
,
rising
costs
and
intense
competition
,
both
domestic
and
foreign
,
have
exerted
increasing
pressure
on
earnings
of
the
textile
industry
in
recent
years
.

from
the
founding
of
the
College
those
responsible
for
its
management
have
planned
to
provide
its
students
favorable
conditions
for
personal
religious
development
and
to
offer
opportunities
through
the
curriculum
and
otherwise
for
understanding
the
meaning
and
importance
of
religion
.

Courses
are
offered
in
ethics
,
the
philosophy
and
history
of
religion
,
Christian
thought
and
history
,
and
the
Bible

which
will
contribute
to
the
moral

and
activities
''
.

The
shift
in
sentiment
from
excessive
optimism
early
in
the
year
to
the
present
mood
of
caution
has
probably
been
a
good
thing
,
in
that
it
has
prevented
the
accumulation
of
the
burdensome
inventories
that
have
characterized
many
previous
swings
in
the
business
cycle
.

In
the
electronics
industry
,
this
tendency
is
well
illustrated
by
inventories
of
TV
sets
.

I
believe
a
further
gain
is
in
prospect
for
1961
.

In
contrast
to
the
lower
turnout
of
TV
,
total
radio
production
increased
from
15.4
million
sets
to
16.7
million
(
excluding
export
)
.

Separate
phonographs
also
had
a
good
year
,
reflecting
the
growing
popularity
of
stereo
sound
and
the
same
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
consumer
to
upgrade
that
characterized
the
radio-TV
market
.

The
outlook
for
entertainment
electronics
in
1961
is
certainly
far
from
clear
at
present
,
but
recent
surveys
have
shown
a
desire
on
the
part
of
consumers
to
step
up
their
buying
plans
for
durable
goods
.

I
would
expect
that
sales
at
retail
in
the
first
half
of
1961
might
be
below
1960
by
some
10
-
15%
but
that
second-half
levels
should
show
a
favorable
comparison
,
with
a
possibility
of
quite
strong
demand
late
in
the
year
if
business
conditions
recover
as
some
recent
forecasts
suggest
they
will
.

I
look
for
TV
sales
and
production
to
be
approximately
equal
at
5.7
million
sets
for
the
year
,
but
I
look
for
some
decline
in
radios
from
the
high
rate
in
1961
to
more
nearly
the
1959
level
of
15.0
-
15.5
million
sets
.

I
therefore
believe
it
is
realistic
to
assume
a
modest
drop
in
the
total
value
of
home
entertainment
electronics
to
about
$1.8
million
,
slightly
below
1960
,
but
above
1959
.

It
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
present
level
of
military
electronics
procurement
is
greater
than
the
industry's
total
sales
to
all
markets
in
1950-1953
,
which
were
good
years
for
our
industry
with
television
enjoying
its
initial
period
of
rapid
consumer
acceptance
.

Among
the
items
scheduled
for
acceleration
in
the
near
future
are
the
Polaris
and
B70
programs
,
strengthening
of
the
airborne
alert
system
of
the
Strategic
Air
Command
,
and
improved
battlefield
surveillance
systems
.

it
has
been
estimated
that
spending
by
the
National
Aeronautics
and
Space
Administration
will
rise
from
less
than
$500
million
in
fiscal
1960
to
more
than
$2
billion
by
1967
,
and
that
the
electronic
industry's
share
of
these
expenditures
will
be
closer
to
50%
than
the
current
20%
.

This
is
now
a
$1.0
billion
business
,
up
from
$0.9
billion
in
1959
,
and
should
reach
$1.1
billion
in
1961
.

The
markets
for
electronic
parts
in
1960
have
reflected
the
changing
patterns
of
the
various
end
equipment
segments
of
the
industry
.

The
appointment
of
Gilbert
B.
Devey
as
General
Manager
of
VecTrol
Engineering
,
Inc.
,
of
Stamford
,
Connecticut
,
a
leading
manufacturer
of
thyratron
and
silicon
controlled
rectifier
electrical
controls
,
has
been
announced
by
David
B.
Peck
,
Vice
President
,
Special
Products
.

Mr.
Brown
,
well-known
,
English-born
inventor
,
prior
to
founding
VecTrol
was
at
various
times
section
leader
in
radio
research
at
Metropolitan
Vickers
Electrical
Co.
,
Ltd.
;
;

He
is
a
fellow
of
the
American
Institute
of
Electrical
Engineers
,
and
a
senior
member
of
the
Institute
of
Radio
Engineers
.

Since
these
duties
fit
neatly
with
those
of
the
proposed
presidential
aide
,
one
person
,
with
adequate
staff
assistance
,
could
fill
both
jobs
.

He
may
welcome
their
appropriate
participation
in
the
determination
of
high
policy
,
but
he
has
a
right
to
expect
,
in
return
,
that
they
will
leave
administrative
matters
to
the
administration
.

Letting
the
administration
take
details
off
their
hands
would
give
them
more
time
to
inform
themselves
about
education
as
a
whole
,
an
area
that
would
benefit
by
more
faculty
attention
.

There
are
,
nevertheless
,
several
things
that
the
president
can
do
to
stimulate
participation
and
to
enhance
the
prestige
of
those
who
are
willing
to
exercise
their
privilege
.

Success
will
require
tact
,
sensitivity
to
faculty
prerogatives
,
patience
,
and
persistence
.

The
administration
at
the
same
time
,
looks
to
the
chairmen
for
strategic
aid
in
building
stronger
departments
.

An
alert
dean
will
confer
all
through
the
year
on
personnel
needs
,
plans
for
the
future
,
qualifications
of
those
on
the
job
,
and
bright
prospects
elsewhere
.

The
president
or
dean
reads
some
of
his
publications
to
form
the
truest
possible
evaluation
of
the
quality
of
his
mind
.

No
good
way
to
evaluate
teaching
ability
has
yet
been
discovered
,
although
some
institutions
use
inventory
sheets
for
a
list
of
criteria
.

He
should
personally
consider
the
potential
of
a
faculty
member
proposed
for
tenure
,
to
guard
against
the
mistake
of
making
this
profoundly
serious
commitment
turn
solely
upon
the
man's
former
achievements
.

In
the
first
instance
,
adequate
appropriate
reading
materials
and
library
accommodations
must
be
planned
.

Trustees
,
faculty
,
and
administration
can
consider
the
consequences
of
decisions
before
they
are
made
,
instead
of
afterwards
.

It
inspires
confidence
in
his
institution's
determination
to
establish
goals
and
to
achieve
them
.

Before
deciding
where
it
is
going
,
however
,
a
college
or
university
must
know
where
it
is
.

Implementation
of
the
master
plan
will
inevitably
be
uneven
.

The
president's
opportunity
for
influencing
education
reaches
its
highest
point
,
as
he
decides
which
projects
he
will
cut
back
,
which
he
will
advance
by
increased
allowances
or
new
fund-raising
efforts
.

He
reviews
and
shapes
the
work
of
others
to
mold
a
single
joint
product
that
will
best
promote
the
aims
of
the
institution
.

Higher
education
cannot
compete
with
the
salary
scales
of
the
business
world
,
but
an
educational
institution
can
offer
many
potent
intangible
attractions
to
members
of
the
business
community
that
will
offset
the
differences
in
income
.

It
has
recently
become
practical
to
use
the
radio
emission
of
the
moon
and
planets
as
a
new
source
of
information
about
these
bodies
and
their
atmospheres
.

and
that
the
maximum
of
the
radio
emission
came
about
days
after
Full
Moon
,
which
is
again
in
contrast
to
the
infrared
emission
,
which
reaches
its
maximum
at
Full
Moon
.

Steady
radiation
which
was
presumably
of
thermal
origin
was
observed
from
Venus
at
3.15
and
9.4
cm
,
and
from
Mars
and
Jupiter
at
3.15
cm
in
1956
(
Mayer
,
McCullough
,
and
Sloanaker
,
1958
,
A
,
B
,
C
)
,
and
from
Saturn
at
3.75
cm
in
1957
(
Drake
and
Ewen
,
1958
)
.

In
the
relatively
short
time
since
these
early
observations
,
Venus
has
been
observed
at
additional
wave
lengths
in
the
range
from
0.8
to
10.2
cm
,
and
Jupiter
has
been
observed
over
the
wave-length
range
from
3.03
to
68
Aj
.

It
should
be
possible
,
however
,
to
put
useful
limits
on
the
diameters
of
the
radio
sources
by
observing
with
large
reflectors
or
with
interferometers
.

Therefore
,
neglecting
the
extreme
outbursts
,
reflected
solar
radiation
is
not
expected
to
cause
sizable
errors
in
the
measurements
of
planetary
radiation
in
the
centimeter-
and
decimeter-wave-length
range
.

The
moon

2.1
observations

Such
high-resolution
observations
as
these
are
needed
at
several
wave
lengths
in
order
that
the
radio
emission
of
the
moon
can
be
properly
interpreted
.

Measurements
at
3.15
cm
were
obtained
on
11
days
spread
over
the
interval
May
3
to
June
19
,
1956
,
using
the
50-foot
reflector
at
the
U.
S.
Naval
Research
Laboratory
in
Washington
.

Abstract

Thus
,
the
energy
transferred
from
the
arc
to
the
anode
was
partly
fed
back
into
the
arc
.

In
plasma
generators
as
currently
commercially
available
for
industrial
use
or
as
high
temperature
research
tools
often
more
than
50%
of
the
total
energy
input
is
being
transferred
to
the
cooling
medium
of
the
anode
.

The
pressure
gradient
producing
the
jet
is
due
to
the
nature
of
the
magnetic
field
in
the
arc
(
rapid
decrease
of
current
density
from
cathode
to
the
anode
)
.

however
,
the
anode
is
still
the
part
receiving
the
largest
heat
flux
.

The
following
possibilities
exist
for
achieving
this
:
1
.

Continuous
motion
of
the
arc
contact
area
at
the
anode
by
flow
or
magnetic
forces
.

3
.

Gas
injection
through
a
porous
anode
(
transpiration
cooling
)
not
only
feeds
back
the
energy
transferred
to
the
anode
by
the
above
mentioned
processes
,
but
also
modifies
the
conditions
in
the
arc
itself
.

The
anode
material
was
porous
graphite
.

The
anode
in
figure
2
was
mounted
by
means
of
the
anode
holder
which
was
attached
to
a
steel
plug
and
disk
.

In
addition
,
the
inner
surface
of
the
carbon
shield
was
covered
with
aluminum
foil
to
reduce
radiation
.

Temperatures
of
the
shield
and
of
the
surface
of
the
water-cooled
anode
holder
were
measured
by
thermocouples
to
account
for
heat
received
by
the
coolant
but
not
originating
from
the
anode
plug
.

The
power
source
was
a
commercial
D.
C.
rectifier
.

At
100
Amp
the
360
cycle
ripple
was
less
than
0.5
V
(
peak
to

The
current
was
regulated
by
means
of
a
variable
resistor
and
measured
with
a
50
mV
shunt
and
millivoltmeter
.

The
arc
voltage
was
measured
with
a
voltmeter
whose
terminals
were
connected
to
the
anode
and
cathode
holders
.

A
high
frequency

was
used
to
start

The
argon
flow
through
the
porous
anode
was
varied
systematically
between
Af
and
Af
.

For
each
mass
flow
rate
the
arc
voltage
was
measured
.

To
measure
the
surface
temperature
of
the
anode
plug
,
the
surface
was
scanned
with
a
pyrometer
.

The
mean
temperature
of
the
surface
was
then
computed
according
to
the
following
relation
:
Af
where
x
is
the
fraction
of
the
plug
area
covered
by
the
hot
spot
.

The
upstream
gas
temperature
measured
with
the
thermocouple
shown
in
figure
2
was
Af
.

The
thermocouples
in
the
aluminum
disk
shown
in
figure
2
indicated
an
equilibrium
temperature
of
the
surface
of
Af
.

The
temperature
distribution
of
figure
4
gives
Af
for
all
blowing
rates
,
assuming
Af
.

The
radiation
loss
from
the
anode
surface
was
computed
according
to
Af
where
Af
is
the
mean
of
the
fourth
powers
of
the
temperatures
Af
and
Af
calculated
analogously
to
equation
(

)
.

There
is
a
small
well
in
the
top
in
which
the
fluid
or
paste
to
be
tested
is
placed
.

The
instrument
used
for
this
work
was
a
slight
modification
of
that
previously
described
.

In
this
test
a
Af
tape
was
pulled
between
the
blocks
with
a
motor
and
pulley
at
a
rate
of
Af
with
a
clearance
of
0.002''
''
on
each
side
of
the
tape
.

The
face
of
one
block
contained
a
hole
''
in
diameter
which
led
to
a
manometer
for
the
measurement
of
the
normal
pressure
.

Although
there
were
only
four
fluids
tested
,
it
was
apparent
that
there
were
two
distinct
types
.

Such
an
instrument
is
expected
to
be
especially
useful
if
it
could
be
used
to
measure
the
elasticity
of
heavy
pastes
such
as
printing
inks
,
paints
,
adhesives
,
molten
plastics
,
and
bread
dough
,
for
the
elasticity
is
related
to
those
various
properties
termed
``
length
''
,
``
shortness
''
,
``
spinnability
''
,
etc.
,
which
are
usually
judged
by
subjective
methods
at
present
.

In
the
above
development
we
have
applied
the
thermodynamics
of
equilibrium
(
referred
to
by
some
as
thermostatics
)
to
the
steady
state
.

The
concept
of
the
strain
energy
as
a
Gibbs
function
difference
Af
and
exerting
a
force
normal
to
the
shearing
face
is
compatible
with
the
information
obtained
from
optical
birefringence
studies
of
fluids
undergoing
shear
.

(
B
)
That
because
of
the
low
viscosity
of
the
fluid
,
the
internal
pressure
is
the
same
in
all
directions
.

These
are
reasonable
assumptions
with
low
viscosity
fluids
suspended
in
high
viscosity
fluids
which
are
subjected
to
low
rates
of
shear
.

This
formula
is
given
by
Rumscheidt
and
Mason
.

There
are
no
data
published
in
the
literature
on
the
shape
of
low
viscosity
drops
to
confirm
the
above
formulas
.

Its
value
was
Af
from
the
above
data
.

It
is
appropriate
to
call
attention
to
certain
thermodynamic
properties
of
an
ideal
gas
that
are
analogous
to
rubber-like
deformation
.

This
is
known
as
conformational
entropy
.

The
energy
for
any
isothermal
work
done
by
the
perfect
gas
must
come
as
thermal
energy
from
its
surroundings
.

An
isotropic
resonance
shift
of
Af
to
lower
applied
fields
indicates
a
weak
isotropic
hyperfine
contact
interaction
.

The
general
theory
of
resonance
shifts
is
used
to
derive
a
general
expression
for
the
second
moment
Af
of
a
polycrystalline
paramagnetic
sample
and
is
specialized
to
Af
.

Af
appeared
to
be
well
suited
for
the
study
of
these
matters
,
since
it
is
a
normal
paramagnet
,
with
three
unpaired
electrons
on
the
chromium
,
its
crystal
structure
is
very
simple
,
and
the
unknown
position
of
the
hydrogen
in
the
strong
Af
bond
provides
structural
interest
.

We
first
discuss
the
Af
bond
in
Af
.

We
then
outline
the
theory
of
the
interaction
of
paramagnetic
dipoles
with
nuclei
and
show
that
the
theory
is
in
excellent
agreement
with
experiment
.

The
information
provided
by
the
electron
paramagnetic
effects
is
then
discussed
,
and
finally
the
nuclear
effects
are
interpreted
in
terms
of
various
motional-modified
models
of
the
Af
bond
in
Af
.

There
is
evidence
,
though
less
convincing
than
for
Af
,
that
the
Af
bond
in
nickel
dimethylglyoxime
is
symmetric
.

A
drawing
of
the
structure
is
to
be
found
in
reference
6
.

The
gross
details
of
the
structure
appear
reasonable
.

all
hydrogen
atoms
lie
on
a
sheet
,
but
the
sheet
is
closer
to
one
oxygen
sheet
than
to
the
other

;

A
randomization
of
``
ups
''
and
``

''
is
more
likely
than
ordered
``
ups
''
and
``
downs
''
in
position
(

)
since
the
hydrogen
atoms
are
well
separated
and
so
the
position
of
one
could
hardly
affect
the
position
of
another
,
and
also
since
ordered
``
up
''
and
``

''
implies
a
larger
unit

,
for
which
no
evidence
exists
.

samples

Subsequently
,
we
learned
from
Douglass
that
his
sample
contained
a
few
percent
Af
impurity
.

500
ml
of
1M
aqueous
Af
with
1
Af
added
are
heated
in
a
bomb
at
170-degrees-C
for
48
hours
.

Mass
spectrometric
analysis
of
gases
evolved
upon
heating
to
410-degrees-C
indicated
nitrogen
oxides
and
water
vapor
.

However
,
Af
adsorbs
water
from
the
atmosphere
and
this
may
account
for
the
low
chromium
analysis
and
high
total
weight
loss
.

For
exactly
three
unpaired
electrons
the
coefficient
would
be
3.10
.

The
x-ray
data
are
consistent
with
particle
sizes
of
1000
A
or
greater
.

The
value
derived
was
16
microseconds
.

Such
a
density
corresponds
to
a
paramagnetic
ion
density
of
about
Af
.

The
bubble
was
filled
to
the
top
and
special
precautions
were
taken
to
prevent
any
sample
from
remaining
in
the
capillary
.

Spectra
were
also
obtained
from
a
third
sample
of
Af
which
had
been
diluted
to
three
times
its
original
volume
with
powdered
,
anhydrous
alundum
(

)
.

The
cleaning
process

One
gram
of
cotton
has
been
found
to
have
a
specific
surface
area
of
Af
.

Even
here
there
is
room
for
some
variation
,
for
metal
surfaces
vary
in
smoothness
,
absorptive
capacity
,
and
chemical
reactivity
.

The
soiled
fabrics
used
for
rapid
testing
of
detergent
formulations
are
made
in
such
a
way
that
only
part
of
the
soil
is
removed
by
even
the
best
detergent
formulation
in
a
single
wash
.

In
this
way
,
numerical
values
for
the
relative
efficacy
of
various
detergent
formulations
can
be
obtained
by
measuring
the
reflectance
(
whiteness
)
of
the
cloth
swatches
before
and
after
washing
.

Although
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
process
of
washing
fabrics
involves
a
number
of
phenomena
which
are
related
together
in
an
extremely
complicated
way
and
that
these
phenomena
and
their
interrelations
are
not
well
understood
at
the
present
,
this
section
attempts
to
present
briefly
an
up-to-date
picture
of
the
physical
chemistry
of
washing
either
fabrics
or
hard
surfaces
.

Stains
,
which
include
the
wide
variety
of
nonparticulate
materials
which
give
color
even
when
present
in
very
low
concentration
on
the
soiled
object
.

The
dirt
on
the
soiled
objects
is
mechanically
held
by
surface
irregularities
to
some
extent
.

In
addition
,
dirt
particles
can
be
held
onto
a
soiled
surface
by
sticky
substances
or
by
the
surface
tension
of
liquids
,
including
liquid
greases
.

Greases
,
stains
,
and
miscellaneous
soils
are
usually
sorbed
onto
the
soiled
surface
.

Greasy
soils
are
hardly
removed
by
washing
in
plain
water
;
;

Although
the
matter
has
not
been
unequivocally
demonstrated
,
the
available
data
show
that
micelles
in
themselves
do
not
contribute
significantly
to
the
detergency
process
.

From
the
equilibrium
sorption
data
which
are
available
,
it
seems
logical
to
expect
that
polyphosphate
ions
would
be
strongly
sorbed
on
the
surface
of
the
dirt
(
especially
clay
soils
)
so
as
to
give
it
a
greatly
increased
negative
charge
.

The
negatively
charged
dirt
particles
then
leave
the
surface
and
go
into
the
aqueous
phase
.

It
is
evident
that
the
requirements
imposed
by
these
effects
upon
any
one
detergent
constituent
acting
alone
are
severe
.

Upon
consideration
of
the
variety
of
soils
and
fabrics
normally
encountered
in
the
washing
process
,
it
is
little
wonder
that
the
use
of
a
number
of
detergent
constituents
having
``
synergistic
''
properties
has
gained
widespread
acceptance
.

The
rate
of
the
gas
phase
exchange
reaction
appears
to
be
proportional
to
the
first
power
of
the
absorbed
light
intensity
indicating
that
the
radical
intermediates
are
removed
at
the
walls
or
by
reaction
with
an
impurity
rather
than
by
bimolecular
radical
combination
reactions
.

We
are
reporting
these
investigations
here
briefly
because
of
their
relevancy
to
problems
of
the
study
of
apparently
simple
exchange
reactions
of
chlorine
and
because
the
results
furnish
some
information
on
the
activation
energy
for
abstraction
of
chlorine
atoms
from
carbon
tetrachloride
.

Of
several
methods
employed
for
tagging
chlorine
with
radiochlorine
,
the
exchange
of
inactive
chlorine
with
tagged
aluminum
chloride
at
room
temperature
was
found
to
be
the
most
satisfactory
.

To
prepare
the
latter
,
silver
chloride
was
precipitated
from
a
solution
containing
Af
obtained
from
the
Oak
Ridge
National
Laboratory
.

The
mixture
was
then
extracted
with
alkali
and
with
water
following
which
the
carbon
tetrachloride
was
distilled
on
a
Vigreux
column
,
a
25%
center
cut
being
retained
which
was
then
degassed
under
vacuum
in
the
presence
of
Af
.

This
chlorine-carbon
tetrachloride
solution
was
illuminated
for
a
day
following
which
the
flask
was
resealed
onto
a
vacuum
system
and
the
excess
chlorine
distilled
off
.

The
contents
of
the
manifold
for
liquid
phase
experiments
were
then
mixed
by
shaking
,
redistributed
to
the
reaction
tubes
,
frozen
down
,
and
each
tube
was
then
sealed
off
.

The
reactants
for
the
gas
phase
experiments
were
first
frozen
out
in
a
side-arm
attached
to
the
manifold
and
then
allowed
to
distil
slowly
into
the
manifold
of
pre-cooled
reaction
cells
before
sealing
off
.

This
method
in
general
solved
the
problem
of
obtaining
fairly
equal
concentrations
of
reactants
in
each
of
the
six
cells
from
a
set
.

In
a
few
experiments
the
tubes
were
made
from
standard
6
mm.
i.d.
Pyrex
tubing
of
1
mm.
wall
thickness
.

Both
types
of
tube
withstood
the
pressure
of
approximately
20
atmospheres
exerted
by
the
carbon
tetrachloride
at
220-degrees
.

Relative
incident
light
intensities
were
measured
with
a
thermopile
potentiometer
system
.

In
the
liquid
phase
runs
the
amount
of
carbon
tetrachloride
in
each
reaction
tube
was
determined
by
weighing
the
tube
before
opening
and
weighing
the
fragments
after
emptying
.

The
reaction
rates
observed
at
200-degrees
ranged
from
Af
of
the
chlorine
exchanged
per
hour
to
0.7
exchanged
per
hour
.

In
most
cases
the
chlorine
concentration
was
about
Af
.

The
improvement
was
most
noticeable
in
the
greater
consistency
among
reaction
cells
prepared
as
a
group
on
the
same
manifold
.

Some
80
reaction
tubes
from
13
manifold
fillings
were
illuminated
in
the
temperature
range
from
40
to
85-degrees
in
a
further
endeavor
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
irreproducibility
and
to
obtain
information
on
the
activation
energy
and
the
effect
of
light
intensity
.

In
series
1
,
the
relative
light
intensity
was
varied
by
varying
the
distance
of
the
lamp
from
the
reaction
cell
over
the
range
from
14.7
to
29.2
cm.
.

The
Poynting-Robertson
effect
(
Robertson
,
1937
;
;

The
radial
velocity
varies
inversely
as
the
particle
size
--
a
1000-m-diameter
particle
near
the
orbit
of
Mars
would
reach
the
sun
in
about
60
million
years
.

De
Jager
(
1955
)
has
calculated
the
times
required
for
these
particles
to
reach
the
atmosphere
under
the
influence
of
the
Poynting-Robertson
effect
,
which
in
this
case
causes
the
orbits
to
become
more
and
more
eccentric
without
changing
the
semi-major
axis
.

Since
there
is
a
continual
loss
of
micrometeoritic
material
in
space
because
of
the
radiation
effects
,
there
must
be
a
continual
replenishment
:
otherwise
,
micrometeorites
would
have
disappeared
from
interplanetary
space
.

According
to
Whipple
(
1955
)
,
cometary
debris
is
sufficient
to
replenish
the
material
spiraling
into
the
sun
,
maintaining
a
fairly
steady
state
.

Beyond
a
few
million
kilometers
from
the
Earth
,
but
still
in
the
region
of
the
Earth's
orbit
,
a
prediction
of
the
flux
of
dust
is
even
more
unreliable
.

There
are
several
sources
of
evidence
on
the
micrometeorite
environment
.

The
cores
of
deep-sea
sediments
and
content
of
collectors
in
remote
regions
are
valuable
in
this
category
.

On
May
15
,
a
very
large
increase
occurred
with
Af
of
mass
between
Af
and
Af
;
;

The
day-to-day
rate
varied
by
less
than
a
factor
of
4.5
.

If
one
assumes
that
the
average
flux
did
not
change
between
measurements
,
a
mass-distribution
curve
is
obtained
which
relates
the
flux
of
particles
larger
than
a
given
radius
to
the
inverse
power
of
the
radius
.

With
detectors
sensitive
to
three
mass
intervals
and
based
on
a
few
counts
,
the
second
and
third
Russian
space
probes
indicate
that
the
flux
of
the
smallest
particles
detected
is
less
than
that
of
larger
ones
.

This
``
ejection
''
momentum
is
linearly
related
to
the
particle
energy
.

The
threshold
mass
is
derived
from
the
momentum
threshold
with
the
assumption
of
a
mean
impact
velocity
of
Af
in
the
U.S.
work
and
Af
in
the
U.S.S.R.
work
.

if
a
substantial
fraction
of
the
dust
is
orbiting
about
the
Earth
,
only
about
one
third
the
above-mentioned
average
velocity
should
be
used
in
deriving
the
mass
.

The
figures
in
the
next-to-last
column
are
derived
with
the
assumption
of
50
per
cent
shielding
by
the
Earth
;
;

Note
that
the
mass
scale
is
one
to
two
orders
of
magnitude
greater
than
some
previously
used
;
;

The
observational
data
determining
the
concentration
distribution
have
a
range
of
error
which
is
magnified
in
the
extension
into
the
micrometeorite
region
.

The
biological
and
physical
properties
of
infectious
particles
have
been
studied
intensively
during
the
past
fifteen
years
.

Much
of
the
older
experimental
work
on
respiratory
infections
was
accomplished
by
very
artificial
procedures
.

The
relationship
between
particle
size
and
infectious
dose
is
illustrated
in
Table
1
.

Depending
on
the
organism
,
there
may
be
multiplication
in
some
food
or
beverage
products
,
i.e.
,
in
milk
for
example
.

Four
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
was
disseminated
while
the
ship
was
traveling
a
distance
of
156
miles
.

The
behavior
of
a
biological
aerosol
,
on
a
much
smaller
scale
,
is
illustrated
by
a
specific
field
trial
conducted
with
a
non-pathogenic
organism
.

A
satisfactory
cloud
was
produced
even
though
these
nozzles
were
only
about
5
per
cent
efficient
in
producing
an
initial
cloud
in
the
size
range
of
1
to
5
microns
.

The
maximum
distance
sampled
was
23
miles
from
the
source
.

Some
agents
have
been
shown
to
be
much
more
toxic
or
infectious
to
experimental
animals
when
exposed
to
aerosols
of
optimum
particle
size
than
by
the
natural
portal
.

Moreover
,
it
should
not
be
so
fastidious
in
its
growth
requirements
as
to
make
production
on
a
militarily
significant
scale
improbable
.

Mutants
may
also
be
developed
with
changes
in
biochemical
properties
that
are
of
importance
in
identification
.

Some
of
those
who
question
the
value
of
BW
have
assumed
that
the
only
potential
would
be
in
the
establishment
of
epidemics
.

This
is
why
this
approach
to
BW
defense
has
not
been
given
major
attention
.

Lousiness
is
a
prerequisite
for
epidemic
typhus
.

It
should
be
no
more
difficult
to
deliver
such
devices
than
other
weapons
.

America
is
rapidly
becoming
a
nation
that
uses
processed
,
precooked
and
even
predigested
foods
.

This
is
an
enormous
industry
that
is
subject
to
sabotage
.

One
must
include
the
preparation
of
soft
drinks
and
the
processing
of
milk
and
milk
products
.

Speer
and
coworkers
,
in
a
similar
study
of
blood
group
antibodies
of
whole
sera
,
used
a
series
of
gradients
for
elution
from
Aj
.

The
cells
were
washed
three
times
with
saline
,
anti-human
serum
was
added
,
the
cells
were
resuspended
,
and
the
mixture
was
centrifuged
at
1000
rpm
for
1
min
and
examined
for
agglutination
.

Those
antisera
shown
by
immunoelectrophoresis
to
be
of
the
``
broad
spectrum
''
type
were
selected
for
use
in
the
present
study
.

After
dialysis
the
sample
was
centrifuged
and
the
supernatant
placed
on
a
Af
cm
column
of
EEAE-cellulose
equilibrated
with
starting
buffer
.

Each

contained
1700

For
protein
identification
,
fractions
from
the
column
were
concentrated
by
pervaporation
against
a
stream
of

at
5-degrees-C
or
by
negative

in
an
apparatus
which
permitted

of

against

Ultracentrifugation
.

Fractions
from
the
column
which
were
to
be
subjected
to
analytical
ultracentrifugation
were
concentrated
by
negative
pressure
dialysis
and
dialyzed
for
16
hr
in
the
cold
against
at
least
500
volumes
of
phosphate-buffered
saline
,

,
ionic

0.154
.

They
were
then
centrifuged
at
59,780

for
35
to
80
min
at
20-degrees-C
in
a
Spinco
model

at
a

Sedimentation

were
computed
as
Af

and
relative

of
the
various

were
calculated
from
the

.

This
was
particularly
noticeable
in
group
A
and
group
B
sera
,
in
which
cases
activity
in
Regions
1
and

was
usually
not
detectable
without
prior

and
occasionally
could
not
be
detected
at
all
.

complete
,
in
the
latter

.

In
all
cases
the
activity
against

was
spread
over
a
wider
area
than
that
with
Af
cells
,
regardless
of
the
type
of

(
saline
,

,
indirect
Coombs
)
used
for

Occasionally
,
you
may
come
across
one
or
two
bumblebees
in
the
cold
season
,
when
you
are
turning
over
sods
in
your
garden
,
but
you
have
to
be
a
really
keen
observer
to
see
them
at
all
.

Now
the
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
find
ourselves
a
couple
of
those
wonderful
flowering
currants
such
as
the
red
Ribes
sanguineum
of
our
Pacific
Northwest
,
or
otherwise
a
good
sloe
tree
,
or
perhaps
some
nice
pussy
willow
in
bloom
,
preferably
one
with
male
or
staminate
catkins
.

By
scrutinizing
the
flowers
,
one
can
also
notice
that
the
scale
bears
one
or
two
tiny
warts
.

a
marvelous
arrangement
,
for
it
provides
exactly
what
the
bee
queens
need
to
make
their
beebread
,
a
combination
of
honey
and
pollen
with
which
the
young
of
all
species
are
fed
.

The
only
exception
to
this
is
certain
bees
that
have
become
parasites
.

As
we
have
already
seen
in
the
first
chapter
,
bumblebees
are
bigger
,
hairier
,
and
much
more
colorful
than
honeybees
,
exhibiting
various
combinations
of
black
,
yellow
,
white
and
orange
.

There
must
be
several
dozen
species
in
the
United
States
alone
.

She
continues
to
add
to
the
pollen
supply
as
needed
.

It
is
an
amazing
fact
that
in
some
species
this
will
happen
while
the
summer
is
still
in
full
swing
,
for
instance
,
in
August
.

At
the
old
nest
,
the
queen
will
in
the
early
fall
cease
to
lay
the
fertilized
eggs
that
will
produce
females
.

Not
always
,
though
,
does
the
development
of
a
bumblebee
colony
take
place
in
the
smooth
fashion
we
have
just
described
.

Female
individuals
of
Psithyrus
look
deceptively
like
the
workers
and
queens
of
the
bumblebees
they
victimize
.

The
one
sure
way
to
tell
victim
and
villain
apart
is
to
examine
the
hind
legs
which
in
the
case
of
the
idler
,
Psithyrus
,
lack
the
pollen
baskets
--
naturally
!
!

The
hosts
never
seem
to
recognize
that
something
is
amiss
,
so
that
the
compartment
afterward
is
sealed
normally
.

Later
on
,
they
and
the
mother
Psithyrus
are
fed
by
the
Bombus
workers
.

It
is
almost
certain
that
some
of
these
,
usually
a
trifle
smaller
than
the
honeybees
,
are
andrenas
or
mining
bees
.

After
all
,
social
life
in
the
group
of
the
bees
is
by
no
means
general
,
although
it
certainly
is
a
striking
feature
.

Nomia
melanderi
can
be
found
in
tremendous
numbers
in
certain
parts
of
the
United
States
west
of
the
Great
Plains
,
for
example
,
in
Utah
and
central
Washington
.

The
life
history
of
the
alkali
bee
is
similar
to
that
of
Andrena
,
but
the
first
activity
of
the
adults
does
not
take
place
until
summer
,
and
the
individuals
hibernate
in
the
prepupal
stage
.

Felix
Kopstein
states
that
``
when
the
snake
reaches
its
maturity
it
has
already
reached
about
its
maximal
length
''
,
but
goes
on
to
cite
the
reticulate
python
as
an
exception
,
with
maximum
length
approximately
three
times
that
at
maturity
.

he
was
working
with
species
of
Java
,
so
perhaps
some
tropical
snakes
are
unusual
in
this
respect
.

For
four
of
the
six
(
the
anaconda
and
the
amethystine
python
cannot
be
included
for
lack
of
data
)
there
is
also
a
correlation
between
size
at
maturity
and
maximum
length
,
the
boa
constrictor
being
the
smallest
and
the
Indian
python
the
next
in
size
at
the
former
stage
.

If
,
in
a
certain
part
of
the
range
,
it
starts
life
1
foot
longer
than
do
any
of
the
other
(
relatively
large
)
giants
,
and
reaches
maturity
at
,
let
us
guess
,
18
inches
longer
than
the
others
,
a
quadrupling
of
the
maturity
length
would
result
in
a
maximum
of
(
nearly
)
40
feet
.

The
best
way
to
determine
the
correct
figure
(
in
captives
)
is
by
direct
observation
of
pairs
isolated
from
birth
,
a
method
that
produced
surprising
results
:
maturing
of
a
male
Indian
python
in
less
than
two
years
,
his
mate
in
less
than
three
;
;

Results
from
this
approach
amply
confirm
the
direct
observations
:
about
three
years
are
required
,
there
being
a
possible
slight
difference
between
males
and
females
in
the
time
required
.

Only
the
amethystine
python
and
the
anaconda
must
be
excluded
for
lack
or
paucity
of
data
.

Carpenter's
study
showed
that
female
common
garter
and
ribbon
snakes
of
Michigan
mature
at
about
the
age
of
two
.

Oversized
monsters
are
never
brought
home
either
alive
or
preserved
,
and
field
measurements
are
obviously
open
to
doubt
because
of
the
universal
tendency
to
exaggerate
dimensions
.

The
anaconda
proves
to
be
the
fly
in
the
ointment
,
but
the
reason
for
this
is
not
clear
;
;

There
are
three
levels
on
which
to
treat
the
subject
.

The
next
level
attempts
to
weigh
varied
evidence
and
come
to
a
balanced
,
sensible
conclusion
;
;

field
measurements
by
experienced
explorers
are
not
rejected
,
and
even
reports
of
a
less
scientific
nature
are
duly
evaluated
.

Oliver
has
recently
used
the
second-level
approach
with
the
largest
snakes
,
and
has
come
to
these
conclusions
:
the
anaconda
reaches
a
length
of
at
least
37
feet
,
the
reticulate
python
33
,
the
African
rock
python
25
,
the
amethystine
python
at
least
22
,
the
Indian
python
20
,
and
the
boa
constrictor
.

Detailed
information
on
record
lengths
of
the
giants
is
given
in
the
section
that
follows
.

rate
of
growth
both
before
and
after
this
crucial
stage
;
;

At
birth
,
this
species
varies
considerably
in
size
.

the
extreme
measurements
of
these
fall
between
the
lower
limit
of
the
Brookfield
brood
and
its
average
.

R.
R.
Mole
and
F.
W.
Urich
give
approximately
20
inches
as
the
average
length
of
a
brood
of
thirty
from
the
region
of
the
Orinoco
estuaries
.

William
Beebe
reports
26
inches
and
2.4
ounces
(
this
snake
must
have
been
emaciated
)
for
the
length
and
the
weight
of
a
young
anaconda
from
British
Guiana
.

A
difference
between
subspecies
might
explain
the
great
range
in
size
.

The
most
convincing
recent
measurement
of
an
anaconda
was
made
in
eastern
Colombia
by
Roberto
Lamon
,
a
petroleum
geologist
of
the
Richmond
Oil
Company
,
and
reported
in
1944
by
Emmett
R.
Dunn
.

It
is
possible
that
especially
large
anacondas
will
prove
to
belong
to
subspecies
limited
to
a
small
area
.

When
some
thirteen
records
of
newly
and
recently
born
individuals
are
collated
,
little
or
no
correlation
between
length
and
distribution
can
be
detected
.

the
former
figure
is
based
on
a
somewhat
unusual
birth
of
four
by
a
Central
American
female
(
see
chapter
on
Laying
,
Brooding
,
Hatching
,
and
Birth
)
,
the
latter
on
a
``
normal
''
newly
born
individual
.

Carl
Kauffeld
has
written
to
me
of
sexual
activity
in
February
1943
of
young
born
in
March
1940
.

The
results
are
too
varied
to
allow
generalization
.

The
pulmonary
vein
,
however
,
without
the
limiting
supportive
tissue
septa
as
in
type
1
,
,
follows
a
more
direct
path
to
the
hilum
and
does
not
maintain
this
close
relationship
(
figs.
8
,
22
)
.

Another
marked
difference
is
noted
here
.

The
pulmonary
artery
,
in
addition
to
supplying
the
distal
portion
of
the
respiratory
bronchiole
,
the
alveolar
duct
,
and
the
alveoli
,
continues
on
and
directly
supplies
the
thin
pleura
(
fig.
8
)
.

This
was
accounted
for
primarily
by
the
presence
of
a
bronchial
artery
closely
following
the
pulmonary
artery
.

The
diameter
of
this
bronchial
artery
was
much
too
large
for
it
to
be
a
mere
vasa
vasorum
(
figs.
16
,
23
,
24
)
.

and
along
the
terminal
bronchiole
(
figs.
14
,
17
,
18
,
19
)
.

Discussion

The
volume
and
,
perhaps
,
even
the
characteristics
of
bronchial
arterial
blood
flow
might
be
different
in
the
dog
than
in
the
horse
.

and
,
in
contrast
,
are
present
to
a
relatively
immense
degree
on
a
segmental
basis
in
the
dog
where
lobules
are
absent
(
Van
Allen
and
Lindskog
,
'31
)
.

Anatomically
,
the
horse
lung
appears
to
be
remarkably
like
that
of
man
,
insofar
as
this
can
be
ascertained
from
comparison
of
our
findings
in
the
horse
with
those
of
others
(
Birnbaum
,
'54
)
in
the
human
being
.

Therefore
,
an
explanation
of
this
alveolar
bronchial
artery
supply
might
be
the
nutritive
requirement
of
an
increased
amount
of
supportive
tissue
,
not
primarily
diffusing
in
nature
,
in
the
region
of
the
alveolus
.

The
presence
of
normally
occurring
bronchial
artery-pulmonary
artery
anastomoses
was
first
noted
in
1721
by
Ruysch
,
and
thereafter
by
many
others
.

It
is
distinctly
possible
,
therefore
,
that
simultaneous
pressures
in
all
three
vessels
would
have
rendered
the
shunts
inoperable
and
hence
,
uninjectable
.

In
addition
,
little
work
has
been
done
on
a
comparative
basis
in
regard
to
the
normal
existence
of
bronchial
artery-pulmonary
artery
anastomoses
.

'49
)
found
these
shunts
in
the
human
being
but
was
unable
to
find
them
in
rats
.

The
possibility
that
the
absence
or
presence
of
these
shunts
is
species-dependent
is
therefore
inferred
.

Summary

A
tabulation
of
these
features
permits
the
lungs
to
be
grouped
into
three
distinctive
subgross
types
.

Type
1
,
is
represented
by
the
cow
,
sheep
,
and
pig
;
;

type
2
,
,
by
the
dog
,
cat
,
and
monkey
;
;

type
3
,
,
by
the
horse
.

imperfectly
developed
in
type
3
.

The
pleura
is
extremely
thin
in
type
2
and
septa
are
absent
.

In
type
3
,
this
general
relationship
is
maintained
peripherally
but
not
centrally
where
the
pulmonary
vein
follows
a
more
independent
path
to
the
hilum
as
is
the
case
throughout
the
lung
in
type
2
.

Second
,
for
both
sexes
,
the
21
transverse
lines
in
the
Onset
Profile
vary
more
in
individual
spread
than
those
in
the
Completion
Profile
.

Thus
,
a
child's
Skeletal
Age
``
dots
''
may
be
classified
as
``
advanced
''
when
they
appear
above
the
middle
curve
,
``
moderate
''
when
they
appear
immediately
above
or
below
the
middle
curve
,
and
``
delayed
''
when
they
appear
below
the
lower
curve
.

To
summarize
the
purpose
of
the
Skeletal
Maturity
Chart
:
each
contains
two
kinds
of
skeletal
maturity
norms
which
show
two
quite
different
methods
of
depicting
developmental
level
of
growth
centers
.

Second
,
the
upper
portion
permits
comparison
of
maturity
levels
of
an
equal
number
of
growth
centers
from
the
long
,
short
,
and
round
bones
of
the
five
regions
.

The
lower
portion
permits
comparison
of
maturity
levels
of
short
and
round
bones
predominantly
,
since
only
two
long
bones
are
included
in
Hand
and
Wrist
as
a
region
.

Since
a
Skeletal
Age
rating
can
be
made
at
any
age
during
growth
,
from
Elbow
,
Shoulder
,
Knee
,
or
Foot
as
well
as
Hand
,
it
seems
to
be
the
method
of
choice
when
one
wishes
to
study
most
aspects
of
skeletal
developmental
progress
during
childhood
.

The
difference
between
the
sequence
of
Onset
of
ossification
for
the
sexes
governs
the
numbering
sequence
in
Figures
3
and
4
.

This
difference
is
readily
clarified
by
referring
to
Table
1
.

Length
of
the
shaft
of
these
arrows
may
be
evaluated
according
to
the
standard
deviation
values
for
each
center
in
Table
1
.

We
have
attempted
to
simplify
the
extensive
task
of
analyzing
onset
ages
and
completion
ages
of
each
child
--
more
than
1700
values
for
the
entire
group
--
by
constructing
figures
for
each
of
the
21
centers
so
that
the
data
for
all
34
boys
and
34
of
the
girls
will
appear
together
for
each
growth
center
.

Forty
other
figures
similar
to
5
and
6
and
the
original
data
used
in
the
construction
of
all
figures
and
tables
in
this
monograph
have
been
included
in
the
Appendix
.

The
principles
used
in
making
each
arrow
for
Figures
3
and
4
were
applied
to
the
construction
of
Figures
5
and
6
as
well
as
all
figures
in
the
Appendix
.

The
34
arrows
,
denoting
onset
age
plus
completion
age
deviations
,
have
been
arrayed
in
an
Onset
sequence
which
begins
with
girl
18
who
had
the
earliest
Onset
of
the
34
girls
.

The
mean
onset
age
was
25.3
months
(
Table
1
)
,

Interestingly
enough
,
the
effect
of
the
digitalis
glycosides
is
inhibited
by
a
high
concentration
of
potassium
in
the
incubation
medium
and
is
enhanced
by
the
absence
of
potassium
(
Wolff
,
1960
)
.

In
the
absence
of
additions
to
the
homogenate
,
the
product
formed
is
an
iodinated
particulate
protein
(
Fawcett
and
Kirkwood
,
1953
;
;

Taurog
,
Potter
,
Tong
,
and
Chaikoff
,
1956
;
;

In
addition
,
the
iodoamino
acid
formed
in
largest
quantity
in
the
intact
thyroid
is
di-iodotyrosine
.

If
tyrosine
and
a
system
generating
hydrogen
peroxide
are
added
to
a
cell-free
homogenate
of
the
thyroid
,
large
quantities
of
free
mono-iodotyrosine
can
be
formed
(
Alexander
,
1959
)
.

Its
synthesis
has
not
been
demonstrated
in
cell-free
systems
,
nor
has
its
synthesis
by
systems
with
intact
thyroid
cells
in
vitro
been
unequivocally
proven
.

Secretion

The
presence
of
several
proteases
and
peptidases
has
been
demonstrated
in
the
thyroid
.

Alpers
,
Robbins
and
Rall
,

)
.

A
study
of
their
activity
on
thyroglobulin
has
shown
that
thyroxine
is
not
preferentially
released
and
that
the
degradation
proceeds
stepwise
with
the
formation
of
macromolecular
intermediates
(
Alpers
,
Petermann
and
Rall
,
1956
)
.

It
has
been
shown
that
thyroglobulin
binds
thyroxine
,
but
the
binding
does
not
appear
to
be
particularly
strong
.

Any
of
the
antithyroid
drugs
,
of
either
type
,
if
given
in
large
enough
doses
for
a
long
period
of
time
will
cause
goitre
,
owing
to
inhibition
of
thyroid
hormone
synthesis
,
with
production
of
hypothyroidism
.

The
most
conclusively
identified
is
L-5-vinyl-2-thio-oxazolidone
,
which
was
isolated
from
rutabaga
(
Greer
,
1950
)
.

There
it
seems
that
the
goitrogen
ingested
by
dairy
animals
is
itself
inactive
but
is
converted
in
the
animal
to
an
active
goitrogen
,
which
is
then
secreted
in
the
milk
.

This
connection
was
clarified
by
Smith
and
Smith
(

)
,
who
showed
that
saline
extracts
of
fresh
bovine
pituitary
glands
could
re-activate
the
atrophied
thyroids
of
hypophysectomised
tadpoles
.

Much
of
this
work
has
been
reviewed
by
White
(
1944
)
and
by
Albert
(
1949
)
.

In
the
last
few
years
,
the
application
of
chromatographic
and
other
modern
techniques
to
the
problem
of
isolating
TSH
has
led
to
further
purification
(
Bates
and
Condliffe
,
1960
;
;

The
most
active
preparations
obtained
by
these
two
groups
of
investigators
appear
to
be
similar
in
potency
,
composition
and
physical
properties
.

The
importance
of
knowing
in
what
chemical
forms
the
hormone
may
exist
is
accentuated
by
the
recent
observation
that
there
exists
an
abnormally
long-acting
TSH
in
blood
drawn
from
many
thyrotoxic
patients
(
Adams
,
1958
)
.

The
introduction
of
the
United
States
Pharmacopoeia
reference
standard
in
1952
and
the
redefinition
and
equating
of
the
USP
and
international
units
of
thyroid-stimulating
activity
have
made
it
possible
to
compare
results
published
by
different
investigators
since
that
time
.

Muscle
weakness
is
now
recognized
as
an
uncommon
though
serious
complication
of
steroid
therapy
,
with
most
of
the
synthetic
adrenal
corticosteroids
in
clinical
use
.

This
medication
was
continued
until
February
,
1958
.

Additional
findings
at
this
time
included
cardiomegaly
,
peripheral
arteriosclerosis
obliterans
,
and
cholelithiasis
.

At
first
the
patient
felt
stronger
,
and
the
hemoglobin
rose
to
13.8
gm.
,
but
on
Oct.
20
,
1958
,
he
complained
of
``
caving

in
his

Triamcinolone

was
resumed
and
maintained
until
Feb.

.

Thyroid
function
tests
yielded
normal
results
.

There
were
bilateral
pterygia
and
arcus
senilis
,
and
the
mouth
was
edentulous
.

In
addition
,
other
sections
contained
focal
areas
of
recent
myocardial
necrosis
that
were
infiltrated
with
neutrophils
.

Many
of
the
myocardial
fibers
were
hypertrophied
and
had
large
,
irregular
,
basophilic
nuclei
.

Microscopically
,
there
was
emphysema
,
fibrosis
,
and
vascular
congestion
.

The
firm
red
spleen
weighed
410
gm.
,
and
its
surface
was
mottled
by
discrete
,
small
patches
of
white
material
.

Microscopically
,
there
was
hyperemia
of
the
central
veins
,
and
there
was
some
atrophy
of
adjacent
parenchyma
.

The
mucosa
of
the
jejunum
and
ileum
showed
similar
changes
,
and
in
some
areas
the
submucosa
was
edematous
and
contained
considerable
numbers
of
neutrophils
.

A
section
of
the
colon
revealed
intense
hyperemia
and
extensive
focal
ulcerations
of
the
mucosa
,
associated
with
much
fibrin
and
many
neutrophils
.

Cultures
taken
from
the
jejunum
yielded
Monilia
albicans
,
Pseudomonas
pyocanea
,
Aerobacter
aerogenes
,
and
Streptococcus
anhemolyticus
.

Occasional
tubules
contained
hyaline
casts
admixed
with
neutrophils
.

Throughout
,
there
were
marked
arteriolosclerosis
and
hyalinization
of
afferent
glomerular
arterioles
.

These
changes
were
most
marked
in
the
gastrocnemius
and
biceps
and
less
evident
in
the
pectoralis
,
diaphragm
,
and
transversus
.

In
the
gastrocnemius
and
biceps
there
were
many
swollen
and
homogeneous
necrotic
fibers
such
as
that
shown
in
Figure

.

Purification
of
the
conjugates

In
attempting
to
improve
specificity
of
staining
,
the
fluorescein-labeled
antisera
used
in
both
direct
and
indirect
methods
were
treated
in
one
of
several
ways
:
(
1
)
They
were
passed
through
Dowex-2-chloride
twice
and
treated
with
acetone
insoluble
powders
(
Coons
,
1958
)
prepared
from
mouse
liver
or
from
healthy
sweet
clover
stems
or
crown
gall
tissue
produced
by
Agrobacterium
tumefaciens
(
E.
F.
Smith
&
Townsend
)
on
sweet
clover
stems
.

The
proteins
were
extracted
with
3
volumes
of
Af
in
Af
to
give
a
nearly
neutral
extract
and
precipitated
by
80%
saturation
with
Af
.

(

)
The
conjugates
were
passed
through
a
diethylaminoethyl
(
DEAE
)
cellulose
column
equilibrated
with
neutral
phosphate
buffer
(
PBS
)
containing
Af
potassium
phosphate
and
Af
.

Preparation
of
frozen
sections

Staining
technique

Results

The
intermediate
sera
were
also
similarly
absorbed
with
tissue
powder
.

In
all
the
above
procedures
,
when
the
intermediate
sera
were
diluted
to
1
:
10
or
1
:
100
with
0.85%
saline
,
the
specific
and
nonspecific
fluorescence
were
not
appreciably
reduced
,
whereas
,
a
dilution
of
the
intermediate
sera
to
1
:
500
or
diluting
the
Af
to
1
:
5
greatly
reduced
specific
fluorescence
.

In
addition
to
other
treatments
,
treating
the
sections
with
normal
sheep
serum
for
half
an
hour
before
layering
Af
did
not
reduce
nonspecific
staining
.

In
the
latter
cases
an
additional
treatment
of
the
DEAE-cellulose-treated
Af
with
50
mg
of
sweet
clover
stem
tissue
powder
further
improved
the
specificity
.

With
this
purified
conjugate
the
best
staining
procedure
consisted
of
treating
the
sections
with
1
:
10
dilution
of
Af
for
30
minutes
,
washing
with
PBS
for
15
minutes
,
staining
with
Af
for
30
minutes
,
and
washing
with
PBS
for
15
minutes
.

The
specificity
of
staining
in
WTV
tumors
with
Af
and
Af
but
not
with
NS
and
Af
or
with
antiserum
to
potato
yellow-dwarf
virus
and
Af
,
and
the
absence
of
such
staining
in
crown
gall
tumor
tissue
from
sweet-clover
,
indicate
that
an
antigen
of
WTV
was
being
stained
.

In
all
cases
a
disturbing
amount
of
nonspecific
staining
was
still
present
although
it
was
still
distinguishable
from
specific
fluorescence
.

After
passing
Af
through
DEAE-cellulose
,
the
titer
of
antibodies
to
WTV
in
the
specific
fraction
was
1
:
4
of
the
titer
before
such
passage
(
precipitin
ring
tests
by
R.
F.
Whitcomb
)
;
;

but
mere
dilution
of
the
conjugate
to
1
:
4
did
not
satisfactorily
remove
nonspecific
staining
.

This
was
chiefly
because
of
the
bluish
white
autofluorescence
from
the
cells
.

The
virus
antigen
was
concentrated
in
the
pseudophloem
tissue
.

No
antigen
was
detectable
in
certain
dark
spherical
areas
in
most
cells
.

In
some
tumor
sections
small
spherical
bodies
,
possibly
inclusion
bodies
(
Littau
and
Black
,
1952
)
stained
more
intensely
than
the
rest
of
cytoplasm
and
probably
contained
more
antigen
.

In
the
indirect
method
,
this
was
evident
from
the
fact
that
tumor
sections
were
stained
light
green
even
when
stained
with
NS
and
Af
or
with
Af
only
.

After
Af
and
Af
were
passed
through
Dowex-2-chloride
twice
and
treated
twice
with
healthy
sweet
clover
tissue
powder
,
nonspecific
staining
was
greatly
reduced
but
a
disturbing
amount
of
such
staining
was
still
present
.

In
our
work
the
best
procedure
for
removing
substances
causing
nonspecific
staining
in
order
to
obtain
specific
conjugates
was
to
pass
the
conjugates
through
a
DEAE-cellulose
column
and
in
some
cases
to
absorb
the
first
and
second
milliliter
fractions
with
sweet
clover
tissue
powder
.

Since
emotional
reactions
in
the
higher
vertebrates
depend
on
individual
experience
and
are
aroused
in
man
,
in
addition
,
by
complex
symbols
,
one
would
expect
that
the
hypothalamus
could
be
excited
from
the
cortex
.

Even
more
complex
and
obviously
cortically
induced
forms
of
emotional
arousal
could
be
elicited
in
monkey
A
on
seeing
monkey
B
(
but
not
a
rabbit
)
in
emotional
stress
.

MacLean
stressed
correctly
the
importance
of
the
visceral
brain
for
preservation
of
the
individual
and
the
species
,
as
evidenced
by
the
influence
of
the
limbic
brain
(
including
the
hypothalamus
)
on
emotions
related
to
fight
and
flight
and
also
on
sexual
functions
.

Hypothalamic
balance
and
its
significance

On
the
other
hand
,
the
temporary
reduction
in
hypothalamic
excitability
through
the
injection
of
a
barbiturate
into
the
posterior
hypothalamus
causes
a
lessening
in
frequency
and
amplitude
of
cortical
strychnine
spikes
until
the
hypothalamic
excitability
is
restored
.

Obviously
,
a
vicious
cycle
develops
.

Thus
,
a
low
intensity
of
hypothalamic-cortical
discharges
prevails
in
sleep
and
a
high
one
during
wakefulness
,
resulting
in
synchronous
EEG
potentials
in
the
former
and
asynchrony
in
the
latter
condition
.

The
former
comprise
analeptic
and
psychoactive
drugs
,
the
latter
the
tranquilizers
.

Important
as
these
differences
are
,
they
should
not
obscure
the
basic
fact
that
by
shifting
the
hypothalamic
balance
sufficiently
to
the
parasympathetic
side
,
we
produce
depressions
,
whereas
a
shift
in
the
opposite
direction
causes
excitatory
effects
and
,
eventually
,
maniclike
changes
.

The
emotional
states
produced
by
drugs
influence
the
cortical
potentials
in
a
characteristic
manner
;
;

Some
investigators
have
found
a
parallelism
between
remissions
and
return
of
the
sympathetic
reactivity
of
the
hypothalamus
to
the
normal
level
as
indicated
by
the
Mecholyl
test
and
,
conversely
,
between
clinical
impairment
and
increasing
deviation
of
this
test
from
the
norm
.

The
fundamental
differences
between
physiological
and
pathological
states
of
parasympathetic
(
and
also
of
sympathetic
)
dominance
remain
to
be
elucidated
.

Perhaps
a
clue
to
these
and
related
problems
lies
in
the
fact
that
changes
in
the
intensity
of
hypothalamic
discharges
which
are
associated
with
changes
in
its
balance
lead
also
to
qualitative
alterations
in
reactivity
.

Furthermore
,
conditioned
reactions
are
fundamentally
altered
when
the
hypothalamic
sympathetic
reactivity
is
augmented
beyond
a
critical
level
,
and
several
types
of
behavioral
changes
probably
related
to
the
degree
of
central
autonomic
``
tuning
''
are
observed
.

It
has
further
been
shown
that
:
(
1
)
an
experimental
neurosis
in
its
initial
stages
is
associated
with
a
reversible
shift
in
the
central
autonomic
balance
;
;

(
2
)
drugs
altering
the
hypothalamic
balance
alter
conditioned
reactions
;
;

(
3
)
in
a
state
of
depression
,
the
positive
conditioned
stimulus
may
fail
to
elicit
a
conditioned
reaction
but
cause
an
increased
synchrony
instead
of
the
excitatory
desynchronizing
(
alerting
)
effect
on
the
Aj
.

These
are
few
and
seemingly
disjointed
data
,
but
they
illustrate
the
important
fact
that
fundamental
alterations
in
conditioned
reactions
occur
in
a
variety
of
states
in
which
the
hypothalamic
balance
has
been
altered
by
physiological
experimentation
,
pharmacological
action
,
or
clinical
processes
.

In
view
of
the
important
role
which
emotional
disturbances
play
in
the
genesis
of
neurotic
and
psychotic
disorders
and
the
parallelism
observed
between
autonomic
states
and
psychological
behavior
in
several
instances
,
it
is
further
suggested
that
a
hypothalamic
imbalance
may
play
an
important
role
in
initiating
mental
changes
.

We
can
do
this
through
the
characteristic
values
and
vectors
of
T
in
certain
special
cases
,
i.e.
,
when
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
factors
over
the
scalar
field
F
into
a
product
of
distinct
monic
polynomials
of
degree
1
.

What
can
we
do
with
the
general
T
?
?

First
,
T
may
not
have
a
single
characteristic
value
;
;

Then
(
A
)
Af
;
;

We
shall
find
a
polynomial
Af
such
that
Af
is
the
identity
on
Af
and
is
zero
on
the
other
Af
,
and
so
that
Af
,
etc.
.

We
wish
to
show
that
the
range
of
Af
is
exactly
the
subspace
Af
.

It
is
clear
that
each
vector
in
the
range
of
Af
is
in
Af
for
if
**ya
is
in
the
range
of
Af
,
then
Af
and
so
Af
because
Af
is
divisible
by
the
minimal
polynomial
P
.

This
completes
the
proof
of
statement
(
A
)
.

If
Af
is
the
operator
induced
on
Af
by
T
,
then
evidently
Af
,
because
by
definition
Af
is
0
on
the
subspace
Af
.

Now
the
range
of
Af
is
the
null
space
Af
of
Af
.

Let
T
be
a
linear
operator
on
the
finite-dimensional
vector
space
V
over
the
field
F
.

Suppose
that
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
decomposes
over
F
into
a
product
of
linear
polynomials
.

Now
suppose
that
we
also
have
Af
where
D'
is
diagonalizable
,
N'
is
nilpotent
,
and
Af
.

Since
D'
and
N'
commute
with
one
another
and
Af
,
we
see
that
D'
and
N'
commute
with
T
.

Now
we
have
Af
or
Af
and
all
four
of
these
operators
commute
with
one
another
.

for
,
using
the
fact
that
N
and
N'
commute
Af
and
so
when
R
is
sufficiently
large
every
term
in
this
expression
for
Af
will
be
0
.

if
we
take
Af
above
,
that
will
be
large
enough
.

From
these
results
,
one
sees
that
the
study
of
linear
operators
on
vector
spaces
over
an
algebraically
closed
field
is
essentially
reduced
to
the
study
of
nilpotent
operators
.

Let
us
now
regard
D
as
a
linear
operator
on
the
subspace
V
.

If
Af
is
the
null
space
of
Af
,
then
Theorem
12
says
that
Af
.

Thus
,
the
study
of
the
solutions
to
the
equation
Af
is
reduced
to
the
study
of
the
space
of
solutions
of
a
differential
equation
of
the
form
Af
.

What
probabilities
should
be
attached
to
these
possible
outcomes
?
?

When
three
dice
are
tossed
repeatedly
,
what
is
the
probability
that
the
number
of
aces
is
0
(
or
1
,
or
2
,
or
3
)
?
?

We
now
generalize
these
ideas
for
general
binomial
experiments
.

We
also
give
,
for
each
property
,
an
example
where
the
property
is
absent
.

There
must
be
a
fixed
number
n
of
repeated
trials
.

It
is
natural
from
the
marksman's
viewpoint
to
call
a
bull's-eye
a
success
,
but
in
the
mice
example
it
is
arbitrary
which
category
corresponds
to
straight
hair
in
a
mouse
.

We
classify
mice
as
``
straight-haired
''
or
``
wavy-haired
''
,
but
a
hairless
mouse
appears
.

Experiment
where
p
is
not
constant
.

The
trials
are
independent
.

Strictly
speaking
,
this
means
that
the
probability
for
each
possible
outcome
of
the
experiment
can
be
computed
by
multiplying
together
the
probabilities
of
the
possible
outcomes
of
the
single
binomial
trials
.

Experimentally
,
we
expect
independence
when
the
trials
have
nothing
to
do
with
one
another
.

A
family
of
five
plans
to
go
together
either
to
the
beach
or
to
the
mountains
,
and
a
coin
is
tossed
to
decide
.

Each
person
votes
for
one
of
a
pair
of
pictures
to
receive
a
popular
prize
.

Voting
for
one
picture
may
be
called
``
success
''
,
for
the
other
``
failure
''
.

In
repetitions
of
the
experiment
from
couple
to
couple
,
the
votes
of
the
two
persons
in
a
couple
probably
agree
more
often
than
independence
would
imply
,
because
couples
who
visit
the
museum
together
are
more
likely
to
have
similar
tastes
than
are
a
random
pair
of
people
drawn
from
the
entire
population
of
visitors
.

Table
7-1
illustrates
the
point
.

(
For
instance
,
see
Example
2
of
Section
5-5
,
on
red
cards
in
hands
of
5
.

To
summarize
:

The
random
variable
X
takes
the
values
Af
with
probabilities
Af
or
,
more
briefly
Af
.

The
choice
of
P
and
N
determines
the
binomial
distribution
uniquely
,
and
different
choices
always
produce
different
distributions
(
except
when
Af
;
;

then
the
number
of
successes
is
always
0
)
.

The
set
of
all
binomial
distributions
is
called
the
family
of
binomial
distributions
,
but
in
general
discussions
this
expression
is
often
shortened
to
``
the
binomial
distribution
''
,
or
even
``
the
binomial
''
when
the
context
is
clear
.

As
S
approaches
T
the
square
will
be
outside
C
and
therefore
both
Af
and
Af
must
cross
C
an
odd
number
of
times
as
S
varies
from
zero
to
T
.

Each
point
on
C
,
as
a
vertex
,
may
possess
a
finite
number
of
corresponding
diagonal
points
by
the
above
construction
.

If
the
vertex
is
at
Af
,
and
if
the
interior
of
C
is
on
the
left
as
one
moves
in
the
direction
of
increasing
t
,
then
every
such
corner
can
be
found
from
the
curve
obtained
by
rotating
C
clockwise
through
90-degrees
about
the
vertex
.

The
function
f{t}
defined
in
this
way
is
multi-valued
.

With
the
vertex
at
Af
in
the
C-plane
we
assume
that
Af
is
the
parametric
location
on
C
of
an
ordinary
intersection
Q
between
C
and
Af
.

But
Af
is
just
the
curve
Af
translated
without
rotation
through
a
small
arc
,
for
Af
is
always
obtained
by
rotating
C
through
exactly
90-degrees
.

The
arc
is
itself
a
segment
of
an
analytic
curve
.

The
fact
that
there
can
not
be
any
limit
points
of
the
set
except
in
closed
intervals
follows
from
the
argument
used
in
Lemma
1
,
namely
,
that
near
any
tangent
point
in
the
C-plane
the
curves
C
and
Af
are
analytic
,
and
therefore
the
difference
between
them
must
be
a
monotone
function
in
some
neighborhood
on
either
side
of
the
tangent
point
.

In
some
neighborhood
of
an
isolated
tangent
point
in
the
f-plane
,
say
Af
,
the
function
Af
is
either
double-valued
or
has
no
values
defined
,
except
at
the
tangent
point
itself
,
where
it
is
single-valued
.

A
continuous
change
in
T
through
an
amount
E
results
in
a
translation
along
an
analytic
arc
of
the
curve
Af
.

The
first
possibility
results
in
a
closed
interval
of
tangent
points
in
the
f-plane
,
the
end
points
of
which
fall
into
category
(
B
)
or
(
C
)
.

The
graph
of
f
has
at
least
one
component
whose
support
is
the
entire
interval
Aj
.

We
suppose
not
.

otherwise
by
Lemma
1
the
component
would
extend
beyond
these
points
.

But
this
is
a
contradiction
,
for
we
know
that
the
multiplicity
of
f{t}
is
odd
for
every
T
.

We
again
consider
a
fixed
point
P
at
Af
and
a
variable
point
Q
at
Af
on
C
.

We
erect
a
square
with
PQ
as
a
side
and
with
free
corners
Af
and
Af
adjacent
to
P
and
Q
respectively
.

The
values
Af
are
the
ordinary
values
at
Af
of
a
multi-valued
function
g{t}
which
has
components
corresponding
to
those
of
f{t}
.

Proof
.

Now
with
P
fixed
at
Af
,
Af-values
occur
when
the
corner
Af
crosses
C
,
and
are
among
the
values
of
S
such
that
Af
.

Thus
we
obtain
g{t}
by
introducing
an
oblique
g{t}-axis
in
the
Aj
.

Let
Q
be
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
bearing
reguli
Af
and
Af
,
and
let
**zg
be
a
Af
curve
of
order
K
on
Q
.

On
these
generators
let
Af
and
Af
be
,
respectively
,
the
harmonic
conjugates
of
Af
and
Af
with
respect
to
the
two
points
in
which
the
corresponding
generator
meets
Aj
.

The
invariant
lines
are
the
lines
of
the
congruence
of
secants
of
**zg
,
since
each
of
these
meets
Q
in
two
points
which
are
invariant
.

Since
the
complex
of
singular
lines
is
of
order
K
and
since
there
is
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
,
it
follows
from
the
formula
Af
that
the
order
of
the
involution
is
Af
.

Since
two
curves
of
symbol
Af
on
Q
intersect
in
Af
points
,
it
follows
that
there
are
Af
lines
of
Af
which
are
tangent
to
Aj
.

Therefore
,
the
congruence
of
its
secants
,
that
is
the
image
of
a
general
plane
field
of
lines
,
is
of
order
Af
and
class
Af
.

To
avoid
this
contradiction
it
is
necessary
that
C
be
composite
,
with
the
secant
of
**zg
and
a
curve
of
order
Af
as
components
.

But
if
this
is
the
case
,
then
an
arbitrary
pencil
of
lines
having
a
point
,
P
,
of
**zg
as
vertex
is
transformed
into
a
ruled
surface
of
order
Af
having
Af
generators
concurrent
at
P
.

Now
consider
the
transformation
of
the
lines
of
a
bundle
with
vertex
,
P
,
on
**zg
which
is
effected
by
the
involution
as
a
whole
.

From
the
preceding
remarks
,
it
is
clear
that
such
a
bundle
is
transformed
into
itself
in
an
involutorial
fashion
.

the
second
requires
that
there
be
a
line
through
P
which
meets
**zg
in
Af
points
.

Feelings
of
a
community
of
interest
will
have
to
be
recreated
--
in
some
of
the
new
nations
,
indeed
,
they
must
be
built
for
the
first
time
--
on
a
new
basis
which
looks
toward
the
future
and
does
not
rely
only
on
shared
memories
of
the
past
.

As
a
nation
,
we
feel
an
obligation
to
assist
other
countries
in
their
development
;
;

but
this
obligation
pertains
only
to
countries
which
are
honestly
seeking
to
become
responsible
members
of
a
stable
and
forward-moving
world
community
.

In
these
rapidly
changing
societies
there
is
also
too
little
appreciation
of
the
need
for
effort
to
achieve
goals
.

The
civil
services
in
such
societies
are
generally
inadequate
to
deal
competently
with
the
problems
facing
them
;
;

We
should
spread
the
view
that
planning
and
national
development
are
serious
matters
which
call
for
effort
as
well
as
enthusiasm
.

If
modernization
programs
are
imposed
from
above
,
without
the
understanding
and
cooperation
of
the
people
,
they
will
encounter
grave
difficulties
.

These
countries
must
formulate
a
comprehensive
,
long-term
program
covering
the
objectives
of
both
the
private
and
the
public
sectors
of
the
economy
.

Capital
flows
must
be
coordinated
with
national
needs
and
planning
.

Finally
,
a
balance
must
be
effected
among
project
finance
,
utilization
of
agricultural
surpluses
,
and
general
balance
of
payments
support
.

This
is
the
stage
at
which
democratic
developments
must
take
place
if
the
society
is
to
become
an
open
community
of
creative
people
.

Nevertheless
,
impulses
still
exist
among
the
ruling
elite
to
rationalize
and
thus
to
perpetuate
the
need
for
centralized
and
authoritarian
practices
.

American
policy
toward
such
societies
should
stress
our
sympathy
for
the
emerging
social
and
professional
classes
.

The
time
factor

American
and
free-world
policies
can
marginally
affect
the
pace
of
transition
;
;

It
follows
that
any
effective
policy
toward
the
underdeveloped
countries
must
have
a
realistically
long
working
horizon
.

:
:

The
place
of
religion
in
the
simple
,
preliterate
societies
is
quite
definite
;
;

If
the
inner
functions
of
religion
are
performed
,
the
individual
is
a
composed
,
ordered
,
motivated
,
and
emotionally
secure
associate
;
;

Religion
seeks
to
satisfy
human
needs
of
great
pertinence
.

Man
has
the
experience
of
being
helpfully
allied
with
what
he
cannot
fully
understand
;
;

The
universe
is
a
safe
and
permanent
home
.

Under
the
religious
impulse
,
whether
theistic
or
humanistic
,
men
have
joy
in
living
;
;

His
religious
beliefs
provide
him
with
plausible
explanations
for
many
conditions
which
cause
him
great
concern
,
and
his
religious
faith
makes
possible
fortitude
,
equanimity
,
and
consolation
,
enabling
him
to
endure
colossal
misfortune
,
fear
,
frustration
,
uncertainty
,
suffering
,
evil
,
and
danger
.

The
value-system
of
a
community
or
society
is
always
correlated
with
,
and
to
a
degree
dependent
upon
,
a
more
or
less
shared
system
of
religious
beliefs
and
convictions
.

Even
the
non-church
members
--
the
freewheelers
,
marginal
religionists
and
so
on
--
have
the
values
of
Christian
civilization
internalized
in
them
.

Furthermore
,
religion
tends
to
integrate
the
whole
range
of
values
from
the
highest
or
ultimate
values
of
God
to
the
intermediary
and
subordinate
values
;
;

Closely
related
to
this
function
is
the
fact
that
the
religious
system
provides
a
body
of
ultimate
ends
for
the
society
,
which
are
compatible
with
the
supreme
eternal
ends
.

This
something
leads
to
a
conception
of
an
over-all
Social
Plan
with
a
meaning
interpretable
in
terms
of
ultimate
ends
;
;

Religion
fosters
group
life
in
various
ways
.

The
credo
unifies
and
socializes
men
by
attaching
them
completely
to
an
identical
body
of
doctrine
;
;

The
common
codes
,
for
religious
action
as
such
and
in
their
ethical
aspects
for
everyday
moral
behavior
,
bind
the
devotees
together
.

It
might
be
pointed
out
that
the
integrating
function
of
religion
,
for
good
or
ill
,
has
often
supported
or
been
identified
with
other
groupings
--
political
,
nationality
,
language
,
class
,
racial
,
sociability
,
even
economic
.

Overwhelmed
with
the
care
of
five
young
children
and
concerned
about
persistent
economic
difficulties
due
to
her
husband's
marginal
income
,
her
defense
of
denial
was
excessively
strong
.

In
the
family's
own
words
(
during
the
third
of
twelve
visits
)
,
they
had
``
reached
the
crisis
peak
--
either
the
situation
will
give
or
we
will
break
''
!
!

As
seen
in
the
B.
family
,
there
must
be
an
attempt
to
help
the
client
develop
conscious
awareness
of
the
problem
,
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
formal
request
for
assistance
.

The
lack
of
awareness
usually
springs
from
deep
but
disguised
anxiety
,
often
assuming
the
superficial
guise
of
``
not
knowing
''
or
``
not
caring
''
.

While
some
regression
is
inevitable
,
it
is
discouraged
rather
than
encouraged
so
that
the
transference
does
not
follow
the
stages
of
planned
regression
associated
with
certain
casework
adaptations
of
the
psychoanalytic
model
for
insight
therapy
.

These
needs
usually
concern
the
reduction
of
guilt
and
some
relief
of
tension
.

At
certain
critical
stages
,
and
only
for
sound
diagnostic
reasons
,
it
may
be
important
to
accompany
family
members
in
their
use
of
these
resources
if
their
problem-solving
behavior
is
to
be
constructive
rather
than
defeating
.

In
some
programs
,
treatment
is
concentrated
over
a
short
period
of
time
,
while
in
others
,
after
the
initial
contact
is
established
,
flexible
spacing
of
interviews
has
been
experimentally
used
with
apparent
success
.

Woodward
,
for
example
,
has
emphasized
the
``
need
for
a
broad
spectrum
of
services
,
including
very
brief
services
in
connection
with
critical
situations
''
.

Ideally
,
brief
treatment
should
be
arrived
at
as
a
treatment
of
choice
rather
than
as
a
treatment
of
chance
.

Moreover
,
the
shortage
of
treatment
resources
and
the
chronically
persistent
shortage
of
mental
health
manpower
force
us
to
innovate
additional
refinements
of
preventive
intervention
techniques
to
make
services
more
widely
available
--
and
on
a
more
effective
basis
to
more
people
.

Further
research
in
the
meaning
of
crises
as
experienced
by
the
consumers
of
traditional
social
casework
services
--
including
attempts
to
develop
a
typology
of
family
structures
,
crisis
problems
,
reaction
mechanisms
,
and
differential
treatment
approaches
--
and
the
establishment
of
new
experimental
programs
are
imperative
social
needs
which
should
command
the
best
efforts
of
caseworkers
in
collaboration
with
community
planners
.

Sentiment
.

Prior
to
World
War
2
,
there
was
a
higher
percentage
of
endogamous
marriages
than
after
World
War
2
.

From
the
evidence
``
it
may
be
conjectured
that
core
-
core
marriages
are
the
preferred
unions
for
core
males
and
females
;
;

There
is
some
indication
from
a
limited
number
of
interviews
with
members
of
the
population
that
the
element
of
power
,
primarily
the
voluntary
influence
of
non-authoritative
power
,
has
been
exerted
on
actors
in
the
system
,
particularly
in
regard
to
mate
selection
.

This
would
seem
to
vary
from
family
to
family
,
depending
somewhat
on
the
core
or
marginal
``
status
''
of
that
family
.

Loomis
considers
ranking
a
product
of
the
evaluation
process
.

Regulative
norms
governing
subgroups
and
roles
.

There
seems
to
be
an
implied
cultural
value
attached
to
the
fact
of
core
status
within
the
group
.

Additionally
,
the
proscription
of
core
-
Negro
marriages
for
core
families
,
discussed
above
,
would
seem
to
act
as
a
regulative
norm
governing
subgroups
and
roles
.

The
present
study
relates
to
the
theory
of
functional
systems
.

It
is
hypothesized
that
fertility
is
a
function
of
the
social
system
when
the
population
as
a
whole
is
considered
and
a
function
of
the
subsystems
when
the
two-fold
division
of
core
families
and
marginal
families
is
considered
.

Of
particular
utility
in
the
analysis
of
the
development
,
persistence
,
and
change
of
social
systems
has
been
the
use
of
the
master
or
comprehensive
processes
.

Loomis
considers
six
such
processes
in
his
paradigm
.

In
discussing
the
process
of
communication
,
Loomis
defines
it
as
``
the
process
by
which
information
,
decisions
,
and
directives
are
transmitted
among
actors
and
the
ways
in
which
knowledge
,
opinions
,
and
attitudes
are
formed
,
or
modified
by
interaction
''
.

However
,
the
factor
of
physical
isolation
is
not
a
static
situation
.

Urbanization
appears
to
be
an
important
factor
in
the
disintegration
of
this
group
.

Examples
from
this
population
indicate
that
deviance
seems
to
be
sanctioned
by
ostracism
from
the
group
.

The
fact
of
Indian
ancestry
and
``
free
''
status
during
the
days
of
slavery
,
are
important
distinctions
made
by
members
of
the
group
.

As
the
threat
of
encroachment
on
the
system
increases
,
the
``

General

for

The

had
reached
the
pre-war
level
of
efficiency
by
1951

In
spite
of
the
defects
in
this
system
,
the
figures
on
total
population
during
the
late
1930's
and
again
in
the
early
1950's
seem
to
have
represented
actual
conditions
in
most
districts
with
approximate
fidelity
.

But
the
information
on
the
dynamics
of
population
was
often
quite
misleading
.

Its
findings
are
reported
each
year
in
its
Rapport
Sur
l'activite
Pendant

(
Bruxelles
)
.

Somewhat
similar
investigations
have
been
made
by
medical
officers
in
other
areas
.

A
massive
investigation
of
the
characteristics
of
in-migrants
and
prospective
out-migrants
in
Ruanda-Urundi
is
being
carried
on
by
J.
J.
Maquet
,
former
Director
of
the
Social
Science
branch
of
IRSAC
,
now
a
professor
at
l'Universite
Officielle
Du
Congo

et
Du
Ruanda-Urundi
.

Field
operations
were
transferred
from
administrative
personnel
primarily
engaged
in
other
tasks
to
specially
trained
teams
of
full-time
African
investigators
(
three
teams
,
each
working
in
two
provinces
)
.

Sample
areas
in
the
new
investigations
were
selected
strictly
by
application
of
the
principles
of
probability
theory
,
so
as
to
be
representative
of
the
total
population
of
defined

within

In

are

for
both
the
de
facto
(
A
and
C
)
and
de
jure
(
A
and
B
)
populations
;
;

These
changes
represent
,
in
effect
,
a
shift
from
(
1
)
an
administrative
compilation
of
data
obtained
through
procedures
designed
primarily
to
serve
political
and
economic
objectives
to
(
2
)
a
systematic
sampling
census
of
the
whole
African
population
.

But
the
weight
of
feeling
was
heavily
in
the
opposite
direction
.

Many
of
them
appear
to
drop
out
,
for
one
reason
or
another
.

This
has
subsequently
been
verified
by
the
experience
.

In
the
regular
sections
they
have
always
been
more
or
less
discouraged
.

Some
of
these
speculations
may
have
some
merit
,
others
are
somewhat
ambiguous
.

But
few
who
have
experienced
marriage
can
dispute
the
fact
that
the
focus
of
interpersonal
relationships
is
different
in
marriage
than
in
a
pre-marital
situation
.

But
within
that
framework
he
allowed
for
as
much
flexibility
as
possible
.

But
the
greater
part
of
semester
time
was
actually
centered
around
the
attitudes
:
``
So
we
are
married
--
now
how
do
we
make
the
best
of
it
''
?
?

Or
``
How
do
we
enrich
our
already
fine
marriage
''
?
?

Thus
the
films
seen
as
they
came
in
(
coordinated
for
the
regular
sections
)
,
were
often
out
of
context
.

Also
,
although
only
a
few
of
the
students
were
intimately
acquainted
with
each
other
in
the
beginning
,
most
reported
that
when
the
semester
ended
their
dearest
and
closest
campus
friendships
were
with
members
of
that
class
.

In
short
,
it
was
centered
around
learning
how
to
develop
a
more
sensitive
empathy
.

From
here
they
proceeded
to
(
3
)
These
same
areas
in
relation
to
their
own
future
family
life
stages
,
developing
these
to
the
extent
of
examining
various
crises
which
could
be
expected
to
confront
them
at
some
time
or
other
.

As
an
example
of
this
last
facet
,
there
were
some
lengthy
discussions
centered
around
bereavement
.

These
were
often
carefully
written
out
with
a
great
deal
of
thought
behind
them
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
women
class
members
appeared
to
reach
a
far
greater
understanding
than
have
women
members
in
other
sections
that
it
is
more
natural
for
males
as
a
group
to
view
sex
as
sex
rather
than
always
associating
it
with
love
as
most
women
seem
to
do
.

Perhaps
this
was
related
to
the
fact
that
all
were
in
on
it
to
some
extent
.

There
was
also
one
spontaneous

by

of
the

and
19
of
the

.

All
of
the
subjects
in
the
Kohnstamm-negative
and
Kohnstamm-positive
groups
(
as
defined
for
purposes
of
the
personality
studies
)

Discussion

Those
who
responded
with
an
arm-elevation
in
the
naive
state
did
not
change
their
reaction
when
told
that
there
were
some
normal
people
who
did
not
react
in
this
fashion
.

In
no
way
,
either
verbally
or
behaviorally
,
did
the
experimenter
indicate
to
the
subjects
any
preferred
mode
of
responding
to
the
voluntary
contraction
.

Moreover
,
when
the
experimenter
did
inform
those
subjects
that
there
were
some
normal
people
who
did
not
have
their
arm
rise
once
they
relaxed
,
the
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
were
uninfluenced
in
their
subsequent
reactions
to
the
Kohnstamm
situation
.

There
was
no
implication
made
that
their
initial
reaction
(
absence
of
an
arm-elevation
)
was
less
preferred
than
the
presence
of
levitation
.

They
felt
that
they
too
could
counteract
the
upward
arm
movement
by
a
voluntary
effort
after
they
had
once
experienced
the
reaction
.

Another
said
that
her
arm
did
not
go
up
at
first
``
because
I
wouldn't
let
it
;
;

In
contrast
to
this
voluntary-control
explanation
for
nonreactivity
given
by
the
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
,
the
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
offered
an
involuntary-control
hypothesis
to
explain
nonreactivity
.

They
felt
that
they
were
relaxing
as
much
as
they
could
and
that
any
control
factors
which
might
be
present
to
prevent
response
must
be
on
an
unconscious
level
.

but
rather
that
they
could
be
diminished
sufficiently
not
to
interfere
with
arm-levitation
.

However
,
she
was
able
to
relax
and
yield
to
the
moment
.

that
they
can
give
up
their
control
and
allow
themselves
to
be
reactors
rather
than
actors
.

Thus
,
this
readiness
to
relax
controls
,
evidenced
in
the
Kohnstamm
situation
,
appears
to
be
a
more
general
personality
factor
.

Aniseikonic
illusion

The
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
seemed
to
be
freer
to
experience
the
unusual
and
seemingly
impossible
in
the
external
world
.

The
change
in
perceptions
by
some
of
the
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
,
after
they
had
been
informed
of
the
possibilities
of
normal
reactions
,
suggests
that
their
constriction
and
guardedness
is
associated
with
their
general
mode
of
responding
to
strange
or
unknown
situations
.

When
informed
as
to
the
various
possibilities
of
normal
reactions
,
they
were
then
able
to
experience
the
uniqueness
of
the
present
.

It
might
be
postulated
that
these
subjects
are
unduly
afraid
of
being
wrong
;
;

that
they
perceive
new
internal
and
environmental
situations
as
``
threatening
''
until
they
are
tested
and
proved
otherwise
.

Control
of
socioeconomic
status

In
order
to
equate
the
samples
on
socioeconomic
status
,
we
chose
schools
in
both
cities
on
the
basis
of
socioeconomic
status
of
the
neighborhoods
.

Equal
proportions
of
children
in
each
city
were
drawn
from
upper-lower
and
lower-middle
class
neighborhoods
.

Individual
differences
in
maturation
and
the
development
of
readiness
for
learning
to
read
indicate
that
not
until
the
third
grade
have
most
children
had
ample
opportunity
to
demonstrate
their
capacity
for
school
achievement
.

Therefore
,
third-grade
children
were
chosen
as
subjects
for
this
study
.

Twenty-four
classrooms
in
twelve
unstructured
schools
furnished
156
cases
,
87
boys
and
69
girls
.

The
interviewers
were
instructed
not
to
suggest
answers
and
,
as
much
as
possible
,
to
record
the
parents'
actual
words
as
they
described
the
child's
behavior
in
home
situations
.

For
instance
,
the
following
statement
was
rated
low
in
compulsivity
,
``
She's
naturally
quite
neat
about
things
,
but
it
doesn't
bother
her
at
all
if
her
room
gets
messy
.

The
Taylor
Scale
was
adapted
from
the
Minnesota
Multiphastic
Personality
Inventory
,
with
item
selection
based
upon
clinical
definitions
of
anxiety
.

Although
the
Taylor
Scale
was
designed
as
a
group
testing
device
,
in
this
study
it
was
individually
administered
by
psychologically
trained
workers
who
established
rapport
and
assisted
the
children
in
reading
the
items
.

The
question
may
be
raised
whether
or
not
we
are
dealing
with
a
common
factor
in
anxiety
and
compulsivity
.

The
two
ratings
yield
a
correlation
of
,
which
is
not
significantly
different
from
zero
;
;

The
Stanford
Achievement
Test
,
Form
J
,
was
administered
by
classroom
teachers
,
consisting
of
a
battery
of
six
sub-tests
:
Paragraph
Meaning
,
Word
Meaning
,
Spelling
,
Language
,
Arithmetic
Computation
,
and
Arithmetic
Reasoning
.

therefore
,
in
the
investigation
of
the
present
hypothesis
,
it
was
necessary
to
control
this
factor
.

and

present
the
results
of
the
statistical
analysis
of
the
data
when
compulsivity
is
used
as
the
descriptive
variable
.

No
significant
difference
was
found
in
achievement
between
high
and
low
compulsive
children
within
the
unstructured
school
.

The
statistical
analyses
of
achievement
in
relation
to
anxiety
and
teaching
methods
and
the
interactions
of
the
two
are
presented
in
Tables

and

.

While
high
anxiety
children
achieve
significantly
less
well
(
Af
)
in
the
unstructured
school
than
do
low
anxiety
children
,
they
appear
to
do
at
least
as
well
as
the
average
in
the
structured
classroom
.

As
shown
earlier
,
the
highly
anxious
individual
may
be
superior
in
his
memorizing
of
simple
elements
.

Success
reduces
the
prospect
of
threat
and
his
powers
of
discrimination
are
improved
.

By
the
time
the
child
first
attacks
the
actual
problem
of
reading
,
he
is
completely
familiar
and
at
ease
with
all
of
the
elements
of
words
.

Analysis

Analysis
means
the
evaluation
of
subparts
,
the
comparative
ratings
of
parts
,
the
comprehension
of
the
meaning
of
isolated
elements
.

The
president
of
a
small
firm
selling
restaurant
products
,
had
considerable
difficulty
in
finding
suitable
salesmen
for
his
business
.

From
the
point
of
view
of
the
applicants
,
less
time
was
wasted
in
being
evaluated
--
and
they
got
a
meal
out
of
it
as
well
as
some
insights
into
their
performances
.

All
applicants
were
generally
familiar
with
the
work
of
the
receptionist
.

Somewhat
to
his
surprise
he
found
that
one
girl
,
whom
he
would
never
have
considered
for
the
job
since
she
had
appeared
somewhat
mousy
and
also
had
been
in
the
office
a
relatively
short
time
,
did
the
most
outstanding
job
of
playing
the
role
of
receptionist
,
showing
wit
,
sparkle
,
and
aplomb
.

She
was
hired
and
was
found
to
be
entirely
satisfactory
when
she
played
the
role
eight
hours
a
day
.

In
considering
roleplaying
for
analysis
we
enter
a
more
complex
area
,
since
we
are
now
no
longer
dealing
with
a
simple
over-all
decision
but
rather
with
the
examination
and
evaluation
of
many
elements
seen
in
dynamic
functioning
.

However
,
he
turned
out
to
be
a
complete
failure
in
his
new
position
.

At
the
insistence
of
his
own
supervisor
--
the
president
of
the
firm
--
he
enrolled
in
a
course
designed
to
develop
leaders
.

The
entire
group
of
managers
explained
,
in
great
detail
,
a
number
of
human
relations
errors
that
he
made
.

or
we
may
say
that
his
attitude
was
commendable
,
showing
his
independence
of
mind
,
in
his
refusal
to
adjust
to
the
opinions
of
others
.

The
necessary
step
between
diagnosis
and
training
is
acceptance
of
the
validity
of
the
criticisms
.

and
``
cannot
say
''
if
they
were
not
certain
.

The
manager
sat
behind
the
group
so
he
could
see
and
count
the
hands
that
went
up
,
and
the
director
wrote
the
numbers
on
the
blackboard
.

The
results
looked
as
follows
:
Af
.

In
life
we
learn
to
play
our
roles
and
we
``
freeze
''
into
patterns
which
become
so
habitual
that
we
are
not
really
aware
of
what
we
do
.

We
can
see
others
more
clearly
than
we
can
see
ourselves
,
and
others
can
see
us
better
than
we
see
ourselves
.

To
learn
what
we
do
is
the
first
step
for
improvement
.

When
an
evaluative
situation
is
set
up
,
and
no
concern
is
with
the
details
that
lead
to
an
over-all
estimate
,
we
say
that
roleplaying
is
used
for
evaluation
.

This
behavior
is
more
``
veridical
''
--
or
true
--
than
other
testing
behavior
for
some
types
of
evaluation
,
and
so
can
give
quick
and
accurate
estimates
of
complex
functioning
.

The
goal
will
be
to
provide
the
reader
with
an
integrated
rationale
to
aid
him
in
applying
roleplaying
techniques
in
this
unique
training
area
.

The
content
of
his
words
may
lapse
back
into
monotonous
repetition
,
as
if
a
phonograph
needle
were
stuck
in
one
groove
;
;

Then
I
replied
,
coldly
,
``
If
you
despise
me
,
why
don't
you
say
so
,
directly
''
?
?

probably
it
is
correct
to
think
of
it
as
a
matter
of
a
well-grooved
,
stereotyped
mode
of
expression
--
and
no
,
or
but
a
few
,
other
communicational
grooves
,
as
yet
--
being
there
,
available
for
the
patient's
use
,
as
newly-emerging
emotions
and
ideas
well
up
in
him
over
the
course
of
months
.

and
which
,
more
often
than
all
these
,
conveys
a
welter
of
feelings
which
could
in
no
way
be
conveyed
by
any
number
of
words
,
words
which
are
so
unlike
this
welter
in
being
formed
and
discrete
from
one
another
.

In
my
experience
,
a
great
many
of
the
patient's
more
puzzling
verbal
communications
are
so
for
the
reason
that
concrete
meanings
have
not
become
differentiated
from
figurative
meanings
in
his
subjective
experience
.

Thus
he
may
be
referring
to
some
concrete
thing
,
or
incident
,
in
his
immediate
environment
by
some
symbolic-sounding
,
hyperbolic
reference
to
transcendental
events
on
the
global
scene
.

A
borderline
schizophrenic
young
man
told
me
that
to
him
the
various
theoretical
concepts
about
which
he
had
been
expounding
,
in
a
most
articulate
fashion
,
during
session
after
session
with
me
,
were
like
great
cubes
of
almost
tangibly
solid
matter
up
in
the
air
above
him
;
;

We
suggest
the
application
of
certain
data-processing
techniques
as
a
solution
to
the
problem
.

the
information
cell
Af
is
saved
to
represent
the
text
occurrence
.

When
this
situation
exists
,
the
address
Af
will
equal
Af
which
was
produced
from
Af
.

If
Af
was
assigned
as
the
information
cell
for
Af
,
the
routine
can
detect
that
Af
is
identical
to
Af
by
comparing
Af
with
the
form
stored
at
location
Af
.

If
Af
leads
to
an
address
Af
that
is
equal
to
the
address
computed
from
Af
,
even
though
Af
does
not
match
Af
,
the
chain
of
information
cells
is
extended
from
Af
by
storing
the
address
of
the
next
available
cell
in
the
Y-region
,
Af
,
in
Af
.

A
third
cell
can
be
added
by
storing
the
address
of
another
Y-cell
in
Af
;
;

similarly
,
as
many
cells
are
added
as
are
required
.

The
dictionary
form
is
compared
with
each
of
these
text
forms
.

The
grammatical
descriptions
of
all
forms
in
the
dictionary
are
recorded
in
a
separate
part
of
the
dictionary
file
.

The
address
of
the
first
cell
and
the
number
of
cells
used
is
written
in
the
information
cell
for
the
form
.

The
only
requirements
on
dictionary
information
made
by
the
text-lookup
operation
are
that
each
form
represented
by
the
dictionary
be
available
for
lookup
in
the
text-form
list
and
that
information
for
each
form
be
available
in
a
sequence
identical
with
the
sequence
of
the
forms
.

The
tendency
is
toward
putting
dominant
stress
at
the
end
.

From
the
point
of
view
of
syntactic
analysis
the
head
word
in
the
statement
is
the
predicator
has
broken
,
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
meaning
it
would
seem
that
the
trouble
centers
in
the
breaking
;
;

in
who's
a
linguist
?
it
will
generally
be
on
the
complement
a
linguist
.

When
prepositional
complements
are
divided
as
in
what
are
you
looking
for
?
?

They
are
likely
to
lose
dominant
stress
.

Thus
in
a
context
in
which
there
has
been
discussion
of
snow
but
mention
of
local
conditions
is
new
,
dominant
stress
will
probably
be
on
here
in
it
rarely
snows
here
,
but
in
a
context
in
which
there
has
been
discussion
of
local
weather
but
no
mention
of
snow
,
dominant
stress
will
probably
be
on
snows
.

In
I'll
go
with
George
dominant
stress
is
probably
on
George
;
;

If
both
George
and
a
piece
of
information
George
does
not
have
are
prominent
in
the
context
,
but
the
idea
of
telling
George
is
new
,
then
dominant
stress
will
probably
be
on
tell
in
why
not
tell
George
?
?

In
I
knew
you
when
you
were
a
child
,
and
you
were
pretty
then
dominant
stress
on
then
implies
that
the
young
woman
spoken
to
is
still
pretty
.

In
the
written
language
then
can
be
underlined
or
italicized
to
guide
the
reader
here
,
but
much
of
the
time
the
written
language
simply
depends
on
the
reader's
alertness
,
and
a
careless
reader
will
have
to
back
up
and
reread
.

Thus
in
his
friends
are
stranger
than
his
sisters'
strong
stresses
are
normal
for
his
and
sisters'
,
but
in
his
friends
are
stranger
than
his
sisters
strong
stresses
are
normal
for
friends
and
sisters
.

The
desire
to
contrast
the
first
parts
of
words
which
are
alike
in
their
last
components
produces
an
exceptional
disregard
of
the
normal
patterns
of
stress
of
Chinese
and
Japanese
.

Thus
when
yes
,
I
have
is
the
response
to
have
you
finished
reading
the
paper
?
?

In
of
all
the
suggestions
that
were
made
,
his
was
the
silliest
the
possessive
his
represents
his
suggestion
and
is
stressed
.

when
it
represents
only
itself
and
on
which
is
its
complement
(
so
that
go
on
is
semantically
equivalent
to
board
)
,
on
has
stronger
stress
than
go
does
.

When
I
have
instructions
to
leave
is
equivalent
in
meaning
to
I
have
instructions
that
I
am
to
leave
this
place
,
dominant
stress
is
ordinarily
on
leave
.

but
if
a
complement
for
come
is
implied
and
by
Tuesday
is
a
prepositional
unit
used
as
an
adjunct
,
by
will
be
unstressed
or
lightly
stressed
at
most
.

In
the
Steiners
have
busy
lives
without
visiting
relatives
only
context
can
indicate
whether
visiting
relatives
is
equivalent
in
meaning
to
paying
visits
to
relatives
or
to
relatives
who
are
visiting
them
,
and
in
I
looked
up
the
number
and
I
looked
up
the
chimney
only
the
meanings
of
number
and
chimney
make
it
clear
that
up
is
syntactically
a
second
complement
in
the
first
sentence
and
a
preposition
followed
by
its
object
in
the
second
.

Sometimes
even
the
number
of
syllables
is
not
clear
.

Doubt
on
this
point
is
strongest
before
and
or
.

Historically
re
is
the
formative
that
is
employed
also
in
republic
,
and
al
is
the
common
suffix
.

Improvement
,
however
,
is
urgent
,
and
at
least
three
things
will
be
needed
.

An
advanced
student
has
read
a
considerable
number
of
descriptions
of
consonantal
systems
,
including
some
of
the
more
unusual
types
.

The
great
majority
of
present-day
linguists
fall
into
one
or
more
of
a
number
of
overlapping
types
:
those
who
are
convinced
that
tone
cannot
be
analysed
,
those
who
are
personally
scared
of
tone
and
tone
languages
generally
,
those
who
are
convinced
that
tone
is
merely
an
unnecessary
marginal
feature
in
those
languages
where
it
occurs
,
those
who
have
no
idea
how
to
proceed
with
tone
analysis
,
those
who
take
a
simplistic
view
of
the
whole
matter
.

As
these
maladies
overlap
,
so
must
the
cure
.

Analyses
such
as
these
four
will
simultaneously
combat
the
assumptions
that
tone
is
impossible
and
that
it
is
simple
.

Since
tone
systems
typically
comprise
fewer
units
than
either
consonant
or
vowel
systems
,
we
might
expect
that
they
would
be
the
easiest
part
of
a
phonologic
analysis
.

for
example
,
duration
sometimes
figures
in
both
the
vowel
system
and
the
intonation
.

Some
phonetic
features
,
for
example
glottal
catch
or
murmur
,
are
sometimes
to
be
assigned
to
segmental
phonemics
and
sometimes
to
accentual
systems
.

But
no
other
two
phonologic
systems
are
as
difficult
to
disentangle
as
are
tone
and
intonation
in
some
languages
.

A
third
explanation
is
suggested
by
Richardson's
analysis
of
Sukuma
tone
.

There
we
see
a
basically
simple
phonemic
system
enmeshed
in
a
very
complex
and
puzzling
morphophonemic
system
.

Morphophonemic
rules
may
be
thought
of
as
joining
certain
points
in
the
system
.

The
possibilities
in
the
consonantal
system
are
very
numerous
,
and
only
a
small
portion
of
them
are
actually
used
.

The
statement
of
the
system
is
a
different
matter
.

Smaller
systems
can
of
course
be
stated
much
more
succinctly
.

As
a
result
,
many
people
have
been
confirmed
in
their
conviction
that
orthography
design
is
not
an
activity
to
which
experts
can
contribute
anything
but
confusion
.

A
few
of
his
examples
are
of
very
great
interest
,
and
the
whole
discussion
of
some
importance
for
theory
.

Rather
he
weighs
each
phonologic
fact
in
the
light
of
its
orthographic
usefulness
.

It
does
show
one
feature
of
the
system
that
has
not
been
previously
described
.

or
again
because
the
Athabascan
languages
spread
over
a
very
much
larger
territory
(
including
three
wholly
separated
areas
)
;
;

or
both
.

(
On
deduction
of
one-eighth
from
3.46
,
the
stem
item
rate
becomes
3.03
against
2.75
in
equivalent
number
of
languages
.

)
These
general
facts
are
mentioned
to
make
clear
that
the
total
situation
in
the
two
families
is
similar
enough
to
warrant
comparison
.

The
result
is
that
I
included
70
animal
names
,
but
Swadesh
only
4
;
;

and
somewhat
similarly
for
plants
,
16
as
against
4
.

This
exception
may
be
connected
with
Hoijer's
use
of
a
much
higher
percentage
of
verbs
:
22%
of
his
total
list
as
against
3.5%
in
mine
.

Hoijer's
Athabascan
and
my
Yokuts
share
71
identical
meanings
(
with
allowance
for
several
near-synonyms
like
stomach-belly
,
big-large
,
long-far
,
many-much
,
die-dead
,
say-speak
)
.

For
Athabascan
,
with
a
greater
range
of
stems
,
the
first
two
of
five
corresponding
columns
were
identical
,
1
and
2
stems
;
;

Af
;
;

.

If
the
distribution
of
the
71
items
were
wholly
concordant
in
the
two
families
,
the
distance
would
of
course
be
0
.

6
.

His
second
conclusion
,
on
semantic
word
classes
,
agrees
with
mine
.

stem
frequencies
4
and
4
,
64%
;
;

stem
frequencies
4
,
3
,
and
1
,
57%
.

His
formula
will
have
to
be
weighed
,
may
be
altered
or
improved
,
and
it
should
be
tested
on
additional
bodies
of
material
.

I
was
at
least
conscious
of
the
distinction
in
my
full
Yokuts
presentation
that
awaits
publication
,
in
which
,
in
listing
'
Two-Stem
Meanings
'
,
I
set
off
by
asterisks
those
forms
in
which
N
of
stem
B
was
Af
of
stem
,
the
unasterisked
ones
standing
for
Af
;
;

And
why
that
insistence
?
?

In
proportion
as
meanings
are
concrete
,
we
can
better
rely
on
their
being
insulated
and
distinctive
.

If
of
the
founders
of
glottochronology
Swadesh
has
escaped
our
steady
plodding
,
and
Lees
has
repudiated
his
own
share
in
the
founding
,
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
swerve
.

Doubtless
it
was
inevitable
that
differences
of
opinion
should
arise
about
the
methods
for
applying
these
policies
.

Poland

When
the
Yalta
Conference
opened
,
the
American
policy
of
postponing
all
discussion
of
Russia's
western
boundaries
until
the
peace
conference
had
broken
down
.

Starting
in
great
force
late
in
December
,
from
a
line
stretching
from
East
Prussia
to
Budapest
,
the
Red
armies
had
swept
two
hundred
miles
across
Poland
to
the
Oder
,
thirty
miles
from
Berlin
,
and
the
Upper
Danube
region
was
being
rapidly
overrun
,
while
the
Western
Allies
had
not
yet
occupied
all
of
the
left
bank
of
the
Rhine
.

He
stood
up
to
emphasize
his
strong
feeling
on
the
subject
.

The
West
had
long
since
forgotten
the
events
of
1919
,
but
it
was
not
so
easy
for
the
Red
leaders
,
who
felt
that
they
had
suffered
great
injustice
in
that
period
.

Stalin
declared
that
he
preferred
to
continue
the
war
a
little
longer
,
``
although
it
costs
us
blood
''
,
in
order
to
give
Poland
compensation
in
the
West
at
the
expense
of
the
Germans
.

The
issue
was
left
in
abeyance
,
presumably
for
the
peace
conference
.

Believing
devoutly
as
they
did
in
Anglo-Saxon
institutions
,
it
was
important
to
both
Roosevelt
and
Churchill
that
the
Poles
should
have
them
.

More
time
was
spent
in
trying
to
marry
these
incompatibles
than
over
any
subject
discussed
at
Yalta
.

The
result
was
an
agreement
that
the
Lublin
Government
should
be
``
reorganized
on
a
broader
democratic
basis
with
the
inclusion
of
democratic
leaders
from
Poland
itself
and
from
the
Poles
abroad
''
,
and
pledged
to
hold
``
free
and
unfettered
elections
as
soon
as
possible
on
the
basis
of
universal
suffrage
and
secret
ballot
''
.

To
Stalin
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
.

Speaking
with
``
great
earnestness
''
,
he
said
:
``
For
the
Russian
people
,
the
question
of
Poland
is
not
only
a
question
of
honor
but
also
a
question
of
security
.

It
is
in
Russia's
interest
that
Poland
should
be
strong
and
powerful
,
in
a
position
to
shut
the
door
of
this
corridor
by
her
own
force
.

It
is
necessary
that
Poland
should
be
free
,
independent
in
power
.

This
reasoning
was
also
as
inevitable
as
anything
could
be
.

But
at
Yalta
the
conflicting
expectations
of
East
and
West
were
merged
into
an
agreement
by
the
Big
Three
to
assist
all
liberated
countries
in
Europe
``
to
create
democratic
institutions
of
their
own
choice
''
.

In
any
case
``
here
in
their
judgment
conditions
require
''
(
italics
added
)
they
would
``
form
interim
governmental
authorities
broadly
representative
of
all
democratic
elements
in
the
population
and
pledged
to
the
earliest
possible
establishment
through
free
elections
of
governments
responsive
to
the
will
of
the
people
''
.

Professor
McNeill
thinks
that
at
Yalta
,
Stalin
did
not
fully
realize
the
dilemma
which
faced
him
,
that
he
thought
the
exclusion
of
the
anti-Soviet
voters
from
East
European
elections
would
not
be
greatly
resented
by
his
allies
,
while
neither
Roosevelt
nor
Churchill
frankly
faced
``
the
fact
that
,
in
Poland
at
least
,
genuinely
free
democratic
elections
would
return
governments
unfriendly
to
Russia
''
,
by
any
definition
of
international
friendliness
.

The
application
of
these
formulae
could
not
please
both
sides
,
for
they
really
attempted
to
marry
the
impossible
to
the
inevitable
.

Then
the
editorial
added
prophetically
:
``
how
far
they
may
reach
in
Asia
is
yet
undetermined
,
but
they
fall
far
short
of
our
dreams
of
the
war
conferences
''
.

However
,
the
regionally
differentiated
results
,
which
appear
below
in
tables
,
are
interesting
evidence
of
the
problems
of
developing
self-government
under
even
the
most
favorable
circumstances
.

They
were
stressed
in
the
speeches
of
Si
Mubarak
Bekkai
when
the
first
Council
of
Ministers
was
formed
and
again
when
the
Istiqlal
took
a
leading
role
in
the
second
Council
.

From
the
very
beginning
the
electoral
discussions
raised
fundamental
issues
in
Moroccan
politics
,
precisely
the
type
of
questions
that
were
most
difficult
to
resolve
in
the
new
government
.

Until
the
Charter
of
Liberties
was
issued
in
the
fall
of
1958
,
there
were
no
guarantees
of
the
right
to
assemble
or
to
organize
for
political
purposes
.

There
were
rumors
that
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
favored
an
arbitrary
,
``
non-political
''
process
,
which
were
indirectly
affirmed
when
the
King
personally
intervened
in
the
planned
meetings
.

There
remained
only
the
delicate
task
of
maneuvering
the
laws
through
the
labyrinth
of
Palace
politics
and
making
a
small
number
of
policy
decisions
.

From
the
rather
tortuous
history
of
electoral
planning
in
Morocco
an
important
point
emerges
concerning
the
first
elections
in
a
developing
country
and
evaluating
their
results
.

The
value
of
the
elections
was
lost
,
both
as
an
experiment
in
increased
political
participation
and
as
a
reliable
indicator
of
commercial
interest
,
as
shown
in
Table
1
.

The
U.N.F.P.
learned
that
its
urban
organization
,
which
depends
heavily
on
U.M.T.
support
,
was
most
effective
.

The
P.D.I.
and
later
the
Popular
Movement
protected
the
Istiqlal's
``
privileged
position
''
until
the
fall
of
Balafrej
,
and
then
the
Istiqlal
used
the
same
argument
,
which
it
had
previously
ignored
,
against
the
pro-U.N.F.P.
tendencies
of
the
Ibrahim
government
.

The
government
was
most
anxious
that
there
be
a
respectable
response
.

Current
programs

During
World
War
2
,
about
7.5
million
persons
were
enrolled
in
courses
organized
under
two
special
programs
administered
by
state
and
local
school
authorities
:
(
1
)
Vocational
Education
for
National
Defense
,
and
(
2
)
War
Production
Training
.

Most
skilled
industrial
workers
,
nevertheless
,
still
acquire
their
skills
outside
of
formal
training
institutions
.

There
is
little
doubt
that
the
students
benefit
from
vocational
education
.

In
most
states
,
trade
and
industrial
training
is
provided
in
a
minority
of
the
high
schools
,
usually
located
in
the
larger
cities
.

The
major
training
need
of
a
new
industrial
plant
is
a
short
period
of
pre-employment
training
for
a
large
number
of
semi-skilled
machine
operators
.

A
few
key
skilled
workers
experienced
in
the
company's
type
of
work
usually
must
be
brought
in
with
the
plant
manager
,
or
hired
away
from
a
similar
plant
elsewhere
.

Thus
,
besides
the
training
provided
to
youth
in
school
,
the
existence
of
the
school
program
can
have
supplementary
benefits
to
industry
which

Local
focus
of
programs

Planning
of
vocational
education
programs
and
courses
is
oriented
to
local
employer
needs
for
trained
workers
.

All
the
manuals
for
setting
up
vocational
courses
stress
the
importance
of
first
making
a
local
survey
of
skill
needs
,
of
estimating
the
growth
of
local
jobs
,
and
of
consulting
with
local
employers
on
the
types
of
courses
and
their
content
.

No
effort
is
made
in
the
same
studies
to
present
information
on
regional
or
national
demand
trends
in
these
skills
or
to
consider
whether
regional
or
national
demands
for
other
skills
might
provide
much
better
opportunities
for
the
youth
to
be
trained
.

Moreover
,
the
current
information
on
what
types
of
training
are
needed
and
possible
is
too
limited
and
fragmentary
.

Proposals

There
is
little
evidence
that
existing
public
or
private
training
programs
have
any
great
difficulty
getting
students
to
enroll
in
their
programs
,
even
though
they
must
pay
tuition
,
receive
no
subsistence
payments
,
and
are
not
guaranteed
a
job
.

A
training
program
in
a
depressed
area
may
have
few
enrollees
unless
there
is
some
apparent
prospect
for
better
employment
opportunities
afterwards
,
and
the
prospect
may
be
poor
if
the
training
is
aimed
solely
at
jobs
in
the
local
community
.

If
there
is
adequate
information
on
job
opportunities
for
skilled
jobs
elsewhere
,
many
more
workers
can
be
expected
to
respond
.

A
further
possibility
is
suggested
by
the
example
of
the
G.
I.
bills
and
also
by
some
recent
trends
in
attitudes
toward
improving
college
education
:
that
is
to
provide
financial
assistance
to
individuals
for
vocational
training
when
local
facilities
are
inadequate
.

Such
specialized
training
institutions
could
be
located
near
the
most
rapidly
growing
industries
,
where
the
equipment
and
job
experience
exist
and
where
the
future
employment
opportunities
are
located
.

This
would
heighten
possibilities
for
part-time
cooperative
,
on-the-job
and
extension
training
.

After
all
,
too
much
does
not
happen
too
suddenly
,
nor
does
very
little
take
long
.

The
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
these
two
types
of
charting
,
bar
charting
and
point
and
figure
charting
,
remain
the
subject
of
fairly
good-natured
litigation
among
their
respective
professional
advocates
,
with
both
methods
enjoying
in
common
,
one
irrevocable
merit
.

Of
course
,
many
more
things
are
charted
besides
prices
.

The
theory
behind
this
is
,
of
course
,
fundamentalist
in
character
.

But
the
quest
for
such
an
index
goes
on
ceaselessly
,
with
all
manner
of
investors
and
speculators
participating
,
ranging
from
the
sedate
institutional
type
virtually
to
the
proverbial
shoe-string
operator
,
all
seeking
doggedly
,
studiously
,
daily
--
and
often
nightly
--
for
the
enchanting
index
that
will
foretell
the
eternal
secret
:
Which
way
will
the
market
move
--
up
or
down
?
?

Just
as
heavily
invested
are
the
endeavors
of
multitudes
of
modern
men
who
carry
on
the
quest
for
the
enchanting
index
.

They
are
concerned
with
all
things
traded
in
,
securities
,
bonds
,
cocao
,
coffee
,
soybeans
,
cotton
,
tin
,
oats
,
etc.
.

All
these
things
and
countless
more
enter
into
their
calculations
,
and
yet
,
the
enchanting
index
remains
non-forthcoming
.

Not
,
at
any
rate
,
in
the
fuller
sense
of
the
word
.

The
markets
are
far
too
subtle
,
and
the
last
word
in
these
endeavors
will
doubtless
never
be
written
,
for
the
enchanting
index
is
about
as
nebulous
as
the
fountain
of
youth
.

Figures
reporting
the
volume
of
odd-lot
purchases
and
odd-lot
sales
are
released
by
the
stock
exchange
and
carried
in
the
newspapers
.

One
might
well
wonder
why
the
``
public
is
always
wrong
''
and
the
question
raised
is
about
as
awkward
as
the
one
concerned
with
the
chicken
and
the
egg
.

Does
the
``
public
''
usually
sell
at
bottoms
,
or
does
the
market
usually
bottom
out
when
the
``
public
''
sells
?
?

Strong
hands
act
;
;

weak
hands
react
.

When
strong
hands
buy
,
they
are
able
to
buy
more
,
and
they
do
it
even
in
the
face
of
bearish
news
reports
.

But
after
all
,
can
anyone
imagine
a
market
wherein
the
reverse
of
these
things
were
true
?
?

not
before
.

The
study
of
odd-lot
indices
is
somehow
akin
to
the
spectacle
of
a
man
trying
to
outfox
his
own
shadow
,
what
with
all
observers
trying
to
get
on
the
side
of
the
``
few
''
at
the
same
time
.

Mr.
John
Magee
,
whose
work
has
been
discussed
in
this
chapter
,
was
quoted
in
a
New
Yorker
Magazine
profile
as
saying
:
``
Of
course
,
you
have
to
remember
it's
a
good
thing
for
us
chartists
that
there
aren't
more
of
us
.

If
you
got
too
many
people
investing
by
this
method
,
their
operations
would
begin
to
affect
stock
prices
,
and
thus
throw
the
charts
off
.

What
with
traders
trading
for
so
many
different
objectives
,
and
what
with
there
being
so
many
unique
and
individualized
market
theories
and
trading
techniques
in
use
,
and
more
coming
into
use
all
the
time
,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
how
any
particular
theory
or
technique
could
acquire
enough
``
fans
''
to
invalidate
itself
.

Though
the
methods
of
deciding
may
be
profound
and
diverse
,
the
possible
conclusions
remain
but
two
.

Chapter
6
,
more
methods

On
the
other
hand
,
in
a
more
favorable
vein
,
general
business
activity
should
receive
some
stimulus
from
rising
Federal
spending
,
and
the
reduction
in
business
inventories
has
probably
run
a
good
part
of
its
course
.

The
2%
increase
in
retail
sales
in
October
to
a
4-month
high
is
encouraging
in
this
connection
as
well
as
the
most
recent
consumer
survey
by
the
National
Industrial
Conference
Board
,
which
shows
a
decided
pickup
in
consumer
spending
plans
.

The
recovery
will
probably
be
sparked
by
a
rising
rate
of
housing
starts
next
spring
in
response
to
more
readily
available
mortgage
credit
,
as
well
as
by
an
expansion
of
Government
spending
,
well
sustained
consumer
spending
,
and
some
rebuilding
of
business
inventories
.

Slight
downward
pressure

What
does
the
general
business
outlook
suggest
about
the
trend
of
long-term
rates
in
1961
?
?

If
the
trend
of
general
business
activity
follows
the
pattern
suggested
here
,
we
are
likely
to
see
additional
steps
by
the
Federal
Reserve
authorities
to
ease
the
availability
of
credit
.

Certainly
a
further
reduction
in
the
discount
rate
would
be
a
strong
possibility
,
as
well
as
an
easier
reserve
position
for
the
banking
system
.

However
,
the
monetary
authorities
will
continue
to
be
required
to
pay
attention
to
the
consequences
of
their
actions
with
respect
to
our
international
balance
of
payments
position
and
the
outflow
of
gold
,
as
well
as
with
regard
to
avoiding
the
creation
of
excessive
liquidity
in
the
economy
,
which
would
delay
the
effectiveness
of
monetary
policy
measures
in
the
next
expansion
phase
of
the
business
cycle
.

By
the
end
of
the
spring
of
1961
,
assuming
that
a
general
business
recovery
gets
under
way
,
interest
rates
should
begin
to
edge
upward
again
,
depending
upon
the
vigor
of
the
recovery
and
the
determination
with
which
the
monetary
authorities
move
to
restrain
credit
availability
.

My
guess
would
be
that
interest
rates
will
decline
moderately
into
the
spring
of
1961
and
during
the
second
half
of
the
year
will
turn
up
gradually
to
recover
the
ground
lost
during
the
downturn
.

Recent
events
in
the
General
Assembly
of
the
United
Nations
confirm
that
the
cold
war
will
remain
with
us
,
and
probably
intensify
,
for
the
foreseeable
future
.

We
are
just
beginning
the
task
of
trying
to
win
or
maintain
the
friendship
of
the
new
African
nations
against
the
ruthless
competition
of
the
Communist
bloc
.

Moreover
,
it
is
likely
that
Federal
policies
aimed
at
stimulating
a
faster
rate
of
economic
growth
of
the
country
,
to
keep
ahead
of
the
Communist
countries
and
to
demonstrate
that
our
free
economic
system
is
better
than
theirs
,
will
lead
to
rising
Federal
spending
in
certain
areas
such
as
education
,
housing
,
medical
aid
,
and
the
like
.

Accordingly
,
the
expanding
markets
for
consumer
goods
and
housing
occasioned
by
the
higher
rate
of
household
formation
should
enhance
the
general
economic
prospects
of
the
Sixties
.

The
average
annual
rate
of
1,083,000
in
the
second
half
of
the
Sixties
is
still
considerably
below
the
annual
rate
of
1,525,000
in
the
three-year
period
from
April
1947
to
March
1950
.

The
huge
backlog
of
demand
which
was
evident
in
the
first
decade
and
a
half
after
the
War
was
fed
by
liquid
assets
accumulated
by
the
public
during
the
War
,
and
even
more
so
by
the
easier
and
easier
credit
in
the
consumer
loan
and
home
loan
fields
.

Indeed
,
the
apparent
stiffening
of
the
industry's
attitude
in
the
recent
steel
strike
has
a
direct
explanation
in
terms
of
the
model
here
presented
.

For
expository
purposes
,
this
is
best
treated
as
a
model
which
spells
out
the
conditions
under
which
an
important
industry
affected
with
the
public
interest
would
find
it
profitable
to
raise
wages
even
in
the
absence
of
union
pressures
for
higher
wages
.

A
.

For
the
industry
of
this
model
,
the
effect
of
such
public
pressures
in
the
past
has
been
to
hold
the
price
well
below
the
short-run
profit-maximizing
price
(
given
the
wage
rate
and
the
level
of
GNP
)
,
and
even
below
the
entry-limited
price
(
but
not
below
average
cost
)
.

In
such
circumstances
,
it
may
well
be
to
the
advantage
of
the
industry
to
allow
an
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
.

The
entry-limiting
price
will
also
be
raised
for
potential
domestic
competition
,
but
unless
general
inflation
permits
profit
margins
to
increase
proportionately
throughout
the
economy
,
we
might
expect
the
public-limit
price
to
approach
the
entry-limit
price
.

The
foreign-entry-limit
price
would
be
approached
more
rapidly
,
since
domestic
wage-rates
do
not
enter
foreign
costs
directly
.

The
extent
to
which
the
public-limit
price
is
raised
by
a
given
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
is
itself
a
function
of
three
things
:
the
passage
of
time
,
the
level
of
GNP
,
and
the
size
of
the
wage
increase
.

Notice
,
however
,
that
the
passage
of
time
does
not
permit
the
raising
of
prices
per
se
,
without
an
accompanying
wage
increase
.

Similarly
,
higher
levels
of
GNP
do
not
,
in
themselves
,
provide
grounds
for
raising
prices
,
but
they
do
relax
some
of
the
pressure
on
the
industry
so
that
it
can
raise
prices
higher
for
a
given
wage
increase
.

The
single
union
which
faces
the
industry
does
not
restrict
its
membership
,
and
there
is
an
adequate
supply
of
labor
available
to
the
firms
of
the
industry
at
the
going
wage
rate
.

The
union
does
not
regard
unemployment
of
its
own
members
as
a
matter
of
concern
when
setting
its
own
wage
policy
--
its
concern
with
employment
makes
itself
felt
in
pressure
upon
the
government
to
maintain
full
employment
.

For
our
present
purposes
we
assume
that
the
sole
subject
of
bargaining
is
the
basic
wage
rate
(
not
including
productivity
improvement
factors
or
cost-of-living
adjustments
)
,
and
it
is
this
basic
wage
rate
which
determines
the
level
of
costs
.

Changes
in
the
basic
wage
rate
are
cost-raising
,
and
they
constitute
an
argument
for
raising
prices
.

In
the
century
from
1815
to
1914
the
law
of
nations
became
international
law
.

But
there
was
no
pressing
need
to
maintain
these
same
standards
with
regard
to
most
of
the
rest
of
the
world
.

Thus
,
theory
and
doctrine
applicable
among
the
great
nations
and
the
smaller
European
states
did
not
really
comfortably
fit
less
developed
and
less
powerful
societies
elsewhere
.

A
nation
such
as
Switzerland
could
be
neutralized
by
agreement
and
could
be
relied
upon
to
protect
its
neutrality
;
;

more
doubtful
,
but
possible
,
(
with
an
assist
from
the
North
)
was
the
neutralization
of
the
Latin
American
countries
;
;

In
the
international
community
this
reduced
law
to
Jellinek's
auto-limitation
.

He
no
longer
sought
to
find
the
law
;
;

Related
to
,
but
distinguishable
from
,
nationalism
was
the
growth
of
democracy
in
one
form
or
another
.

Increased
participation
in
politics
and
the
demands
of
various
groups
for
status
and
recognition
had
dramatic
effects
upon
law
institutions
.

The
efforts
of
various
interest
groups
to
control
or
influence
governmental
decisions
,
particularly
when
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
impact
of
industralization
,
led
to
a
concentration
of
attention
on
the
legislative
power
and
the
means
whereby
policy
could
be
formulated
and
enforced
as
law
through
bureaucratic
institutions
.

Law
became
a
conscious
process
,
something
more
than
simply
doing
justice
and
looking
to
local
customs
and
a
common
morality
for
applicable
norms
.

First
was
the
period
of
codification
of
existing
law
:
the
Code
Napoleon
in
France
and
the
peculiar
codification
that
,
in
fact
,
resulted
from
Austin's
restatement
and
ordering
of
the
Common
Law
in
England
.

It
was
merely
a
rationalization
and
ordering
of
new
institutions
of
popular
government
.

It
was
not
opposed
to
either
justice
or
morality
;
;

that
business
be
free
from
governmental
supervision
and
notions
of
morality
which
might
clog
the
automatic
adjustments
of
the
free
market
;
;

business
organization
--
the
corporation
--
was
analyzed
in
contractual
terms
;
;

It
is
not
surprising
that
the
international
obligations
of
states
were
also
viewed
in
terms
of
contract
.

Federal
question
jurisdiction

In
1913
an
abortive
provision
was
made
for
the
stay
of
federal
injunction
proceedings
upon
institution
of
state
court
test
cases
.

An
alternative
was
found
in
the
vagueness
of
state
law
as
to
whether
the
offending
order
had
in
fact
been
authorized
.

But
it
is
crucial
that
here
,
unlike
Burford
,
the
trial
court
was
ordered
to
retain
the
case
until
the
state
courts
had
had
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
settle
the
state-law
question
.

To
the
extent
that
the
jurisdictional
principle
of
1875
stands
unmodified
by
subsequent
legislation
,
federal
equitable
relief
against
state
action
must
be
available
--
or
so
it
seems
to
Mr.
Justice
Frankfurter
.

Justices
Frankfurter
and
Jackson
concurred
in
the
Court's
result
,
for
they
found
no
merit
in
the
railroad's
claim
.

A
most
revealing
recent
case
is
Textile
Workers
Union
v.
Lincoln
Mills
.

How
can
judges
exercise
jurisdiction
to
enforce
national
rights
when
Congress
has
created
none
?
?

The
Justice's
elaborate
examination
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
provision
in
question
suggests
that
Congress'
purpose
was
merely
to
make
unions
suable
.

Obviously
,
the
goal
here
proposed
is
the
guiding
principle
in
Mr.
Justice
Frankfurter's
opinions
--
to
the
extent
that
Congress
leaves
the
problem
to
judicial
discretion
.

The
same
rule
of
specialization
and
division
of
labor
guides
him
in
the
FELA
certiorari
cases
,
in
the
administrative
law
area
,
and
indeed
in
the
whole
realm
of
judicial
review
.

He
will
not
be
``
fooled
by
technicalities
''
.

In
other
words
the
burden
of
pleading
clearly
rested
upon
the
pleader
by
state
law
.

Here
,
as
in
the
Byrd
case
,
another
element
of
state
procedure
was
subsumed
to
federal
judge-made
law
.

Federal
law
,
though
invoked
in
a
State
court
,
delimits
the
Federal
claim
--
defines
what
gives
a
right
to
recovery
and
what
goes
to
prove
it
.

The
accused
did
not
object
to
the
trial
court's
charge
to
the
jury
that
discourse
``
may
constitute
a
breach
of
the
peace
if
it
stirs
the
public
to
anger
,
invites
dispute
,
brings
about
a
condition
of
unrest
.

The
Court
said
the
purpose
of
the
section
was
principally
to
spare
the
Government
the
embarrassment
and
trouble
of
dealing
with
several
parties
,
one
of
them
a
stranger
to
the
claim
,
and
to
prevent
traffic
in
claims
,
particularly
tenuous
claims
,
against
the
Government
.

Other
exceptions
are
assignments
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
,
corporate
dissolutions
,
transfers
by
descent
,
or
transfers
by
subrogation
.

A
tax-free
reorganization
not
complying
with
the
merger
or
consolidation
statutes
of
the
states
involved
is
difficult
to
fit
into
an
``
operation
of
law
''
mold
.

The
anti-assignment
statute
was
held
not
to
prevent
the
American
corporation
from
suing
for
a
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
the
British
corporation
.

Proper
evidence
of
the
liquidation
and
succession
must
also
be
filed
.

A
recent
Ruling
,
although
rather
confusing
,
cites
and
follows
Rev.
Rul.
54-17
.

In
a
B
reorganization
,
followed
by
a
section
332
liquidation
,
those
cases
which
hold
that
section
203
is
inapplicable
to
transfers
in
liquidation
appear
to
permit
the
successor
corporation
to
sue
for
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
the
transferor
.

These
results
appear
sound
.

In
virtually
every
case
the
transferor
corporation
is
liquidated
,
and
its
former
stockholders
either
own
outright
,
or
have
a
continuing
stock
interest
in
,
the
assets
which
gave
rise
to
the
tax
.

Nor
is
it
at
all
likely
that
a
``
desperate
''
claim
against
the
Government
will
be
assigned
on
a
contingent-fee
basis
in
the
guise
of
a
tax-free
reorganization
.

It
appears
,
then
,
that
although
the
matter
is
not
dealt
with
in
section
381(c)
,
a
successor
corporation
in
a
reorganization
of
a
type
specified
in
section
381(a)
is
entitled
to
sue
for
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
a
transferor
corporation
.

Section
203
of
the
United
States
Code
has
been
interpreted
as
not
applying
to
claims
against
the
Government
transferred
in
tax-free
reorganizations
.

Similar
considerations
presumably
made
it
difficult
to
prescribe
a
general
rule
where
the
acquired
and
acquiring
corporations
have
different
methods
of
accounting
(
section
381(c)(4)
)
or
depreciation
(
section
381(c)(6)
)
.

Section
362
requires
carryover
of
the
transferor
corporation's
basis
for
property
transferred
,
and
section
1223
provides
for
tacking
on
the
transferor's
holding
period
for
such
property
to
that
of
the
transferee
.

It
is
an
averaging
device
intended
to
ease
the
tax
burden
of
fluctuating
income
;

Simple
``
yes
''
or
``
no
''
answers
do
not
reveal
the
different
shades
of
opinion
that
the
various
respondents
may
have
.

A
respondent
may
want
to
make
alternative
answers
because
he
does
not
know
the
precise
circumstances
assumed
in
the
question
.

The
questionnaire
was
designed
to
elicit
three
types
of
information
:
(

)
the
facts
regarding
certain
characteristics
of
the
respondents
,
including
their
experience
with
,
and
interest
in

business

The
revised
draft
was
mailed
in
July
,
1960
,
to
100
firms
throughout
the
United
States
.

Fifty
of
the
100
firms
were
selected
on
a
random
basis
from
3,500
names
submitted
by
member
companies
of
the
Aerospace
Industries
Association
(
AIA
list

and
fifty
were
selected
in
a
similar
manner
from
a
list
of
1,500
names
compiled
by
the
research
team
from
the
Thomas
Register
(
TR
list
)
.

Ten
days
after
the
questionnaires
were
mailed
,
follow-up
airmail
postcards
were
sent
urging
those
companies
which
had
not
yet
returned
their
questionnaires
to
do
so
at
once
.

The
objective
of
the
study
was
to
determine
the
opinions
and
practices
of
small
firms
selling
to
defense
programs
.

Each
source
selected
from
its
approved
bidders
list
about
200
firms
which
it
believed
to
be
small
businesses
that
participated
in
the
production

support
systems

By
virtue
of
the
legal
responsibilities
of
the
Department
of
Employment
in
the
farm
placement
program
,
we
necessarily
found
ourselves
in
the
middle
between
these
two
forces
.

We
have
sought
to
be
strictly
neutral
as
between
the
parties
,
but
at
the
same
time
we
have
been
required
frequently
to
rule
on
specific
issues
or
situations
as
they
arose
.

The
AWOC
has
been
able
to
employ
the
traditional
weapons
of
labor
--
the
strike
and
the
picket
line
--
with
considerable
success
,
particularly
in
the
area
of
wages
.

Infrequently
do
we
think
of
it
as
a
living
,
continuing
,
operating
control
over
the
system
.

The
pertinent
regulation
for
our
purposes
is
Section
602.2
(
,
)
,
as
follows
:

No
person
shall
be
referred
to
a
position
the
filling
of
which
will
aid
directly
or
indirectly
in
filling
a
job
which
(
1
)
is
vacant
because
the
former
occupant
is
on
strike
or
is
being
locked
out
in
the
course
of
a
labor
dispute
,
or
(
2
)
the
filling
of
which
is
an
issue
in
a
labor
dispute
.

It
is
the
first
part
of
the
Regulation
that
is
currently
at
issue
.

Employer
representatives
have
contended
that
the
Secretary
has
gone
beyond
his
authority
by
such
a
prohibition
,
on
the
grounds
that
the
Wagner-Peyser
Act
requires
only
written
notice
to
the
prospective
worker
that
a
dispute
exists
.

The
growers
have
strenuously
argued
that
I
should
have
accepted
the
Superior
Court
decisions
as
conclusive
and
issued
statewide
instructions
to
our
staff
to
ignore
this
provision
in
the
Secretary's
Regulation
.

The
Attorney
General
of
the
United
States
,
in
considering
the
power
of
the
Secretary
to
issue
similar
regulations
under
the
Wagner-Peyser
Act
relating
to
the
interstate
recruitment
of
farm
workers
,
has
rendered
an
opinion
sustaining
his
authority
.

None
has
yet
arisen
under
condition
(
2
)
,
relating
to
referral
to
jobs
``
the
filling
of
which
is
an
issue
in
a
labor
dispute
''
.

Here
the
problem
is
essentially
one
of
defining
the
word
``
filling
''
.

After
they
have
developed
concepts
,
they
are
free
from
the
necessity
of
manipulating
objects
;
;

The
ability
to
think
seems
to
increase
consistently
with
age
.

One
experiment
showed
the
greatest
one-year
difference
occurring
between
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
years
.

and
that
as
they
mature
their
interests
and
capabilities
change
and
broaden
.

A
considerable
amount
of
evidence
exists
to
show
that
an
unhappy
and
insecure
child
is
not
likely
to
do
well
in
school
subjects
.

As
the
child
grows
older
,
his
emotional
reactions
lead
to
``
moods
''
,
or
emotional
states
drawn
out
over
a
period
of
time
and
expressed
slowly
,
rather
than
in
short
,
abrupt
outbursts
.

Children
differ
widely
in
their
emotional
responses
.

Although
no
national
norms
exist
for
the
social
development
of
children
,
the
teacher
can
find
a
great
deal
of
information
concerning
types
of
social
behavior
normally
displayed
by
children
at
various
age
levels
.

The
following
summary
will
give
the
student
some
idea
about
the
social
characteristics
of
elementary-school
children
;
;

4
.

they
exhibit
a
keen
interest
in
social
,
political
,
and
economic
problems
,
but
they
frequently
have
vague
and
incorrect
notions
about
the
terms
they
use
rather
glibly
in
their
routine
school
work
.

Between
the
ages
of
two
and
four
years
,
negativism
or
resistance
to
adult
authority
is
noticeable
;
;

after
the
fourth
year
it
begins
to
decline
.

However
,
as
we
have
seen
,
in
later
childhood
the
child
begins
to
substitute
the
standards
of
the
peer
group
for
those
of
parents
and
teachers
.

Many
school
systems
now
employ
school
psychologists
and
child
guidance
specialists
.

It
is
the
classroom
teacher
,
however
,
who
has
daily
contacts
with
pupils
,
and
who
is
in
a
unique
position
to
put
sound
psychological
principles
into
practice
.

Teachers
and
administrators
in
many
elementary
schools
have
assumed
that
dividing
the
pupils
in
any
grade
into
groups
on
the
basis
of
test
scores
solves
the
problem
of
meeting
the
needs
of
individuals
.

One
study
,
which
involved
1,524
pupils
in
grades
one
to
six
,
found
that
12
percent
of
the
pupils
were
seriously
maladjusted
and
that
23
percent
were
reading
a
year
below
capacity
.

The
causes
of
retardation
and
maladjustment
may
be
found
in
physical
factors
,
such
as
defective
speech
or
hearing
,
impaired
vision
,
faulty
motor
coordination
,
a
frail
constitution
,
chronic
disease
,
malnutrition
,
and
glandular
malfunctioning
.

They
may
be
related
to
mental
immaturity
or
lack
of
aptitude
for
certain
types
of
school
work
.

Teaching
methods
,
learning
materials
,
and
promotion
policies
may
inhibit
learning
and
lead
to
maladjustments
for
some
children
.

children

he
cannot
be
expected
to
administer
all
the
tests
and
gather
all
the
information
needed
about
each
child
in
his
classroom
.

and
to
utilize
opportunities
,
arising
in
connection
with
regular
classroom
activities
,
for
gaining
a
better
understanding
of
his
pupils
.

Chapter
15
provides
more
detailed
information
about
specific
techniques
used
in
evaluating
pupil
progress
.

During
summer
vacation
periods
these
records
are
stored
in
the
office
of
the
principal
.

Only
the
teacher
and
other
professional
personnel
are
permitted
to
see
or
use
these
records
.

Each
new
teacher
to
whom
the
pupil
goes
is
expected
to
study
the
information
in
the
cumulative
record
and
to
bring
it
up
to
date
.

second
,
that
both
actual
and
pending
desegregation
is
,
with
few
exceptions
,
the
product
or
result
of
court
order
.

The
Report
together
with
other
information
suggests
that
desegregation
in
the
schools
is
slow
.

Now
let's
look
at
the
evidence
that
shows
the
increase
in
desegregation
and
such
increase
as
a
result
of
court
order
.

Similarly
,
further
desegregation
may
come
from
suits
pending
in
three
Tennessee
cities
,
Chattanooga
,
Knoxville
,
and
Memphis
.

This
recapitulation
makes
it
clear
that
school
desegregation
continues
,
including
the
Old
Dominion
State
,
in
spite
of
its
stern
resistance
.

that
on
the
immediate
horizon
,
if
further
large-scale
(
relatively
speaking
)
desegregation
comes
,
it
will
result
from
court
orders
on
suits
filed
in
several
Middle-South
states
.

That
reference
in
the
Report
is
``
continuation
of
the
trend
toward
an
all-Negro
school
system
''
,
a
remark
apparently
occasioned
by
the
increase
of
Negro
school
population
from
74.1
per
cent
to
76.7
per
cent
.

Nearby
Foggy
Bottom
is
ousting
Negroes
.

From
the
Summary
Report
before
us
at
this
Conference
,
a
number
of
problems
are
apparent
.

In
fact
,
in
the
desegregated
school
system
which
may
have
a
good
many
schools
with
all-Negro
population
,
how
can
we
assure
equal
opportunity
?
?

Now
,
the
issues

Issue
no.
2
.

The
earlier
part
of
my
statement
deals
with
the
court
orders
that
resulted
in
desegregation
.

In
thousands
of
school
districts
,
indeed
,
in
the
entire
State
of
Mississippi
,
no
plaintiff
has
come
forth
.

Is
the
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
be
a
person
actually
denied
admission
to
a
school
a
sound
requirement
?
?

Should
Congress
authorize
the
Attorney
General
to
file
suit
to
accomplish
admission
of
a
child
to
a
school
to
which
he
is
denied
entrance
?
?

Should
we
support
a
clause
in
Federal
school
construction
or
school
assistance
legislation
that
would
deny
Federal
funds
to
a
school
district
that
denies
admission
to
a
child
on
account
of
his
race
?
?

Required
public
education
.

Should
a
political
subdivision
,
state
or
county
or
municipality
,
be
required
to
furnish
public
education
?
?

Nearly
half
the
children
still
receive
no
education
.

Must
or
should
the
Federal
government
help
?
?

On
the
whole
,
it
appears
that
they
do
not
favor
their
own
social
classes
in
an
explicit
way
.

The
few
cases
of
clear
favoritism
along
social-class
lines
are
as
likely
as
not
to
involve
representatives
of
the
working
class
on
the
school
board
who
favor
some
such
practice
as
higher
wages
for
janitors
rather
than
pay
increases
for
teachers
,
and
such
issues
are
not
issues
of
educational
policy
.

If
there
were
more
such
cases
,
it
would
be
easier
to
answer
the
question
whether
the
policy-makers
favor
their
own
social
classes
.

Thus
,
the
white
middle
and
lower
classes
are
arrayed
against
the
Negro
middle
and
lower
classes
.

The
members
of
the
educational
profession
have
a
major
voice
in
the
determination
of
educational
policy
,
their
position
being
strongest
in
the
universities
.

that
is
,
they
are
likely
to
favor
a
kind
of
education
that
has
vocational-advancement
value
.

The
``
public
interest
''
groups

They
generally
vote
so
as
to
serve
their
own
constituency
,
and
if
the
constituency
should
be
solidly
middle
class
or
solidly
lower
class
,
they
might
be
expected
to
vote
and
work
for
middle-
or
for
lower-class
interests
in
education
.

Generally
these
commissions
work
earnestly
to
represent
the
interest
of
the
entire
society
,
as
they
conceive
it
.

These
people
are
practically
always
upper-
or
upper-middle-class
persons
,
who
attempt
to
act
in
what
they
regard
as
the
interest
of
the
entire
society
.

Finally
there
are
the
parent
organizations
and
the
laymen's
organizations
such
as
the
National
Association
of
Parents
and
Teachers
,
and
the
Citizens
Committee
on
Public
Schools
.

In
general
,
it
appears
that
educational
decisions
and
educational
policies
are
made
by
people
who
intend
to
act
in
the
interests
of
the
society
as
a
whole
.

But
there
is
very
little
frank
and
conscious
espousal
of
the
interests
of
any
one
social
class
by
the
people
who
have
the
power
to
make
decisions
in
education
.

Educational
policy
in
the
United
States
has
as
an
explicit
goal
the
maximization
of
economic
and
cultural
opportunity
.

Both
of
these
purposes
exist
side
by
side
without
much
overt
conflict
under
present
conditions
.

The
broad
expansion
of
free
education
results
both
in
raising
the
average
economic
and
cultural
level
of
the
society
and
in
promoting
fluidity
within
the
social
structure
.

Fifty
years
ago
the
general
raising
of
the
school-leaving
age
to
sixteen
was
an
example
of
this
movement
.

By
all
means
the
most
important
distinction
is
that
between
those
total-cost
apportionments
which
superimpose
a
distribution
of
admittedly
unallocable
cost
residues
on
estimates
of
incremental
or
marginal
costs
,
and
those
other
apportionments
which
recognize
no
difference
between
true
cost
allocation
and
mere
total-cost
distribution
.

The
first
,
or
double-step
,
type
might
also
be
called
the
``
railroad
type
''
because
of
its
application
to
railroads
(
and
other
transportation
agencies
)
by
the
Cost
Section
of
the
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
.

Nevertheless
,
because
the
Cost
Section
has
felt
impelled
to
make
some
kind
of
a
distribution
of
total
costs
,
it
has
apportioned
this
residue
,
which
it
sometimes
calls
``
burden
''
,
among
the
units
of
carload
traffic
on
a
basis
(
partly
ton
,
partly
ton-mile
)
which
is
concededly
quite
arbitrary
from
the
standpoint
of
cost
determination
.

)
has
amounted
to
about
one
third
of
those
total
revenue
requirements
which
the
carload
freight
business
is
supposed
to
be
called
upon
to
meet
.

and
a
mere
cost
apportionment
which
somehow
spreads
among
the
classes
and
units
of
service
even
those
costs
that
are
strictly
unallocable
from
the
standpoint
of
specific
cost
determination
.

and
these
costs
must
somehow
be
apportioned
among
the
various
classes
and
then
must
somehow
be
reapportioned
among
the
units
of
service
in
order
to
report
unit
costs
that
can
serve
as
tentative
measures
of
reasonable
rates
.

The
general
basis
on
which
these
common
costs
are
assigned
to
differently
measured
units
of
service
will
be
illustrated
by
the
following
highly
simplified
problem
of
an
electric-utility
cost
analysis
.

Here
,
an
apportionment
,
say
,
of
$5,000,000
of
the
total
costs
to
residential
service
as
a
class
would
include
an
allowance
of
perhaps
6
per
cent
as
the
cost
of
whatever
capital
is
deemed
to
have
been
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
residential
consumers
.

Thus
,
during
any
given
year
(
A
)
if
the
revenues
from
the
residential
service
are
$7,000,000
,
(
B
)
if
the
operating
expenses
imputed
to
this
class
of
service
come
to
$5,000,000
,
and
(
C
)
if
the
net
investment
in
(
or
value
of
)
the
plant
and
equipment
deemed
devoted
to
this
service
amounts
to
$30,000,000
,
the
cost
analyst
will
report
that
residential
service
,
in
the
aggregate
,
has
yielded
a
return
of
$2,000,000
or
per
cent
.

Other
services
will
show
different
rates
of
return
,
some
probably
much
lower
and
some
higher
.

There
are
obvious
reasons
of
convenience
for
this
practice
of
excluding
``
cost
of
capital
''
from
the
direct
apportionment
of
annual
costs
among
the
different
classes
of
service
--
notably
,
the
avoidance
of
the
controversial
question
what
rate
of
return
should
be
held
to
constitute
``
cost
of
capital
''
or
``
fair
rate
of
return
''
.

Let
us
also
assume
the
existence
of
only
one
class
or
type
of
service
,
all
of
which
is
supplied
at
the
same
voltage
,
phase
,
etc.
to
residential
,
commercial
,
and
industrial
customers
.

Since
the
company
under
review
is
supplying
what
we
are
here
regarding
as
only
one
kind
of
service
,
we
might
suppose
that
the
problem
of
total
cost
apportionment
would
be
very
simple
;
;

indeed
,
that
it
would
be
limited
to
a
finding
of
the
total
annual
operating
and
capital
costs
of
the
business
,
followed
by
a
calculation
of
this
total
in
terms
of
annual
cost
per
kilowatt-hour
of
consumption
.

costs
actually
vary
in
much
more
complex
ways
.

These
minimum
costs
may
come
to
$1
per
month
,
more
or
less
,
for
residential
and
small
commercial
customers
,
although
they
are
substantially
higher
for
large
industrial
users
,
who
require
more
costly
connections
and
metering
devices
.

Rapoport

Here
I
think
the
role
of
the
philosopher
becomes
apparent
.

)

This
involves
a
sifting
of
the
empirical
and
rational
elements
entering
into
each
social
science
statement
.

Such
a
position
entails
the
negation
of
philosophy
in
its
Platonic
form
as
something
soaring
above
and
embracing
the
empirical
and
mathematical
sciences
.

The
uses
of
philosophy
as
a
logical
clearing
house
are
manifest
to
any
approach
that
does
not
descend
to
pure
sensationalism
.

What
is
left
to
traditional
systems
of
philosophy
is
,
in
effect
,
only
the
history
of
these
fields
prior
to
their
becoming
rigorous
enough
to
abide
by
the
canons
of
scientific
method
.

In
this
situation
,
philosophy
has
survived
by
separating
itself
from
metaphysics
,
by
showing
the
ultimate
questions
to
be
the
meaningless
questions
.

The
relinquishing
by
philosophy
of
pretentious
claims
to
empirical
priority
gives
it
an
ability
to
treat
problems
of
meaning
and
truth
which
in
the
past
it
was
unable
to
examine
because
of
its
missionary
attitude
to
knowledge
of
more
humble
sorts
.

Philosophy
conceived
of
as
servant
to
the
sciences
might
appear
as
less
dramatic
than
philosophy
which
jeers
as
the
sciences
evolve
.

By
clarifying
fundamental
premises
in
the
social
sciences
,
and
defining
the
logical
problems
emergent
at
the
borderlands
of
each
new
scientific
discipline
,
philosophy
can
offer
the
sort
of
distinction
that
can
accelerate
growth
in
human
understanding
.

In
this
,
philosophy
and
science
share
a
common
goal
.

)
Scientific
systems
,
and
this
includes
even
the
relation
of
mechanist
to
relativist
physics
,
are
built
upon
,
refined
and
corrected
.

The
threadbare
notion
that
belief
,
unlike
behaviour
,
is
not
subject
to
objective
analysis
,
has
placed
intuitive
metaphysics
squarely
against
the
sociology
of
knowledge
,
since
it
is
precisely
the
job
of
the
sociology
of
knowledge
to
treat
beliefs
as
social
facts
no
less
viable
than
social
behaviour
.

To
find
a
place
for
them
in
their
theory
of
knowledge
would
require
them
to
revise
the
theory
radically
,
and
yet
that
theory
was
what
they
regarded
as
their
most
important
discovery
.

It
appeared
that
the
theory
could
be
saved
in
one
way
only
.

There
is
perhaps
no
value
statement
on
which
people
would
more
universally
agree
than
the
statement
that
intense
pain
is
bad
.

Let
us
take
a
set
of
circumstances
in
which
I
happen
to
be
interested
on
the
legislative
side
and
in
which
I
think
every
one
of
us
might
naturally
make
such
a
statement
.

I
hold
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
we
mean
to
assert
something
of
the
pain
itself
,
namely
,
that
it
was
bad
--
bad
when
and
as
it
occurred
.

Consider
what
follows
from
the
positivist
view
.

Let
us
put
to
ourselves
the
hypothesis
that
we
had
not
come
on
the
scene
and
that
the
rabbit
never
was
discovered
.

Clearly
not
.

Indeed
,
we
should
say
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
the
accident
of
our
later
discovery
made
no
difference
whatever
to
the
badness
of
the
animal's
pain
,
that
it
would
have
been
every
whit
as
bad
whether
a
chance
passer-by
happened
later
to
discover
the
body
and
feel
repugnance
or
not
.

The
first
argument
is
thus
an
ideal
experiment
in
which
we
use
the
method
of
difference
.

Let
us
suppose
that
the
animal
did
not
in
fact
fall
into
the
trap
and
did
not
suffer
at
all
,
but
that
we
mistakenly
believe
it
did
,
and
say
as
before
that
its
suffering
was
an
evil
thing
.

In
the
only
sense
in
which
badness
is
involved
at
all
,
whatever
was
bad
in
the
first
case
is
still
present
in
its
entirety
,
since
all
that
is
expressed
in
either
case
is
a
state
of
feeling
,
and
that
feeling
is
still
there
.

The
suggestion
that
in
saying
something
evil
had
occurred
we
were
after
all
making
no
mistake
,
because
we
had
never
meant
anyhow
to
say
anything
about
the
past
suffering
,
seems
to
me
merely
frivolous
.

On
the
theory
before
us
,
such
relief
would
be
groundless
,
for
in
that
suffering
itself
there
was
nothing
bad
at
all
,
and
hence
in
its
nonoccurrence
there
would
be
nothing
to
be
relieved
about
.

And
there
is
a
way
in
which
he
might
hold
that
badness
did
in
this
case
precede
our
own
feeling
of
disapproval
without
belonging
to
the
pain
itself
.

This
way
of
escape
is
theoretically
possible
,
but
since
it
has
grave
difficulties
of
its
own
and
has
not
,
so
far
as
I
know
,
been
urged
by
positivists
,
it
is
perhaps
best
not
to
spend
time
over
it
.

But
suppose
that
a
week
later
we
revert
to
the
incident
in
thought
and
make
our
statement
again
.

And
suppose
that
the
circumstances
have
now
so
changed
that
the
feeling
with
which
we
made
the
remark
in
the
first
place
has
faded
.

In
these
circumstances
,
since
what
was
expressed
by
the
remark
when
first
made
is
,
on
the
theory
before
us
,
simply
absent
,
the
remark
now
expresses
nothing
.

When
we
repeat
the
remark
that
such
suffering
was
a
bad
thing
,
the
feeling
with
which
we
made
it
last
week
may
be
at
or
near
the
vanishing
point
,
but
if
we
were
asked
whether
we
meant
to
say
what
we
did
before
,
we
should
certainly
answer
Yes
.

but
on
the
theory
before
us
such
a
belief
would
not
make
sense
.

But
that
is
not
exactly
my
point
.

``
I
have
heard
stories
''
,
he
writes
,
``
of
the
most
terrible
,
the
most
unnatural
actions
,
of
the
most
monstrous
murders
,
told
with
the
most
spontaneous
,
childishly
merry
laughter
''
.

There
is
therefore
nothing
about
them
to
which
an
attitude
of
approval
or
condemnation
could
be
fitting
.

Would
applause
,
for
example
,
be
fitting
if
,
apart
from
the
applause
,
there
were
nothing
good
to
applaud
?
?

Would
condemnation
be
fitting
if
,
independently
of
the
condemnation
,
there
were
nothing
bad
to
condemn
?
?

If
there
is
nothing
evil
in
these
things
,
if
they
get
their
moral
complexion
only
from
our
feeling
about
them
,
why
shouldn't
they
be
greeted
with
a
cheer
?
?

it
would
needlessly
bring
badness
into
the
world
;
;

In
any
event
,
the
extraordinary
result
of
this
injury
was
that
he
became
``
psychically
blind
''
,
while
at
the
same
time
,
apparently
,
the
sense
of
touch
remained
essentially
intact
.

This
circumstance
in
the
patient's
case
plus
the
fact
that
his
tactual
capacity
remained
basically
in
sound
working
order
constitutes
its
exceptional
value
for
the
problem
at
hand
since
the
evidence
presented
by
the
authors
is
overwhelming
that
,
when
the
patient
closed
his
eyes
,
he
had
absolutely
no
spatial
(
that
is
,
third-dimensional
)
awareness
whatsoever
.

The
force
of
the
authors'
analysis
(
if
indeed
it
has
any
force
)
can
be
felt
by
the
reader
,
I
believe
,
only
after
three
questions
have
been
successfully
answered
.

(
1
)
When
an
object
was
placed
in
the
patient's
hand
,
he
had
no
difficulty
determining
whether
it
was
warm
or
cold
,
sharp
or
blunt
,
rough
or
smooth
,
flexible
,
soft
,
or
hard
;
;

and
,
therefore
,
he
could
not
recognize
even
long-familiar
things
upon
seeing
them
again
.

and
there
was
ample
evidence
of
the
following
sort
to
corroborate
him
.

Therefore
,
his
only
recourse
was
to
learn
the
shape
all
over
again
for
each
new
visual
experience
of
the
same
individual
object
or
type
of
object
;
;

As
one
would
surmise
,
the
procedure
,
however
,
could
be
repeated
with
the
same
object
or
with
the
same
type
of
object
often
enough
,
so
that
the
corresponding
visual
blots
and
the
merest
beginning
of
the
tracing
movement
would
provide
clues
as
to
the
actual
shape
,
which
the
patient
then
immediately
could
determine
by
a
kind
of
inference
.

Perhaps
the
very
important
question
--
What
is
,
then
,
exactly
the
role
of
kinesthetic
sensations
in
the
patient's
ability
to
recognize
forms
and
shapes
by
means
of
the
tracing
movements
when
he
is
actually
looking
at
things
?
?

--
has
now
been
raised
in
the
reader's
mind
and
in
the
following
form
.

To
speak
of
this
underlying
view
of
the
world
is
to
embark
upon
matters
of
subjective
judgment
.

The
storms
of
the
past
had
died
away
,
and
the
great
upheaval
which
was
to
mark
the
following
century
had
not
yet
begun
to
disturb
men's
minds
.

The
ninth
century
was
in
its
artistic
work
``
the
spiritually
freest
and
most
self-sufficient
between
past
and
future
''
,
and
the
loving
skill
spent
by
its
artists
upon
their
products
is
a
testimonial
to
their
sense
that
what
they
were
doing
was
important
and
was
appreciated
.

.

imitation
and
borrowing
of
motifs
now
become
ascertainable
.

The
potters
of
the
Aegean
islands
thus
stood
apart
from
those
of
the
mainland
,
and
in
Greece
itself
Argive
,
Corinthian
,
Attic
,
Boeotian
,
and
other
Geometric
sequences
have
each
their
own
hallmarks
.

These
local
variations
were
to
become
ever
sharper
in
the
next
century
and
a
half
.

On
these
pillars
rested
that
solid
basis
for
life
and
thought
which
was
soon
to
be
manifested
in
the
remarkably
unlimited
ken
of
the
Iliad
.

Further
we
cannot
go
,
for
the
Dark
ages
deserve
their
name
.

These
are
the
centuries
in
which
the
inhabitants
of
the
Aegean
world
settled
firmly
into
their
minds
and
into
their
institutions
the
foundations
of
the
Hellenic
outlook
,
independent
of
outside
forces
.

The
historian
can
only
point
out
those
lines
which
were
major
enough
to
find
reflection
in
our
limited
evidence
,
and
must
hope
that
future
excavations
will
enrich
our
understanding
.

Throughout
the
Dark
ages
,
it
is
clear
,
the
Greek
world
had
been
developing
slowly
but
consistently
.

The
first
slanting
rays
of
the
new
day
cannot
yet
dispel
all
the
dark
shadows
which
lie
across
the
Aegean
world
;
;

Greek
civilization
was
swirling
toward
its
great
revolution
,
in
which
the
developed
qualities
of
the
Hellenic
outlook
were
suddenly
to
break
forth
.

While
many
tokens
point
forward
,
the
main
achievements
stand
as
a
culmination
of
the
simple
patterns
of
the
Dark
ages
.

The
dominant
pottery
of
the
century
was
Geometric
;
;

The
modern
student
,
who
knows
what
was
to
come
next
,
is
likely
to
place
first
the
factors
of
change
which
are
visible
in
the
eighth
century
.

Not
all
men
of
the
period
would
have
accepted
this
emphasis
.

for
the
developments
in
these
areas
make
sense
only
if
they
are
connected
to
the
age
of
revolution
itself
.

The
antecedents
of
Dipylon
vases
and
of
the
Iliad
lie
in
the
Aegean
past
.

Dipylon
pottery

but
artists
now
were
ready
to
refine
and
elaborate
their
inheritance
.

By
800
social
and
cultural
security
had
been
achieved
,
at
least
on
a
simple
plane
;
;

Ripe
Geometric
potters
continued
to
employ
the
old
syntax
of
ornaments
and
shapes
and
made
use
of
the
well-defined
though
limited
range
of
motifs
which
they
had
inherited
.

Though
the
spread
of
this
type
of
decoration
in
the
Aegean
has
not
yet
been
precisely
determined
,
it
seems
to
appear
first
in
the
Cyclades
,
which
were
among
the
leading
exporters
of
pottery
throughout
the
century
.

Plate
12
illustrates
four
examples
,
which
are
Ripe
or
Late
Geometric
work
of
common
spirit
but
of
different
schools
.

It
was
nearly
sundown
before
they
finished
the
business
with
Beall
and
began
riding
down
the
stream
.

To
the
west
of
this
road
was
another
low
bluff
,
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
,
covered
with
scrub
oak
and
other
brush
.

With
the
first
reports
,
Russell's
horse
wheeled
to
the
right
and
ran
towards
the
buildings
while
Cook
,
followed
by
a
hail
of
bullets
,
raced
towards
the
arroyo
of
Salyer's
Canyon
immediately
in
front
of
him
,
just
reaching
it
as
his
horse
fell
.

At
a
very
shallow
place
,
two
Mexicans
rushed
into
the
open
for
a
shot
.

MacPherson
boldly
approached
the
fortified
adobe
house
and
demanded
entrance
.

Since
the
strength
of
the
Mexicans
had
been
underrated
,
too
small
a
posse
had
been
collected
,
and
since
the
deputy
had
not
been
provided
with
search
warrants
,
MacPherson
and
his
men
decided
it
was
much
wiser
to
withdraw
.

Cattle
stealing
and
killing
,
again
serious
during
the
spring
of
1891
,
placed
the
land
grant
company
officers
in
a
perplexing
position
.

Pels
complained
:
``
Litigants
and
witnesses
were
put
to
the
expense
and
inconvenience
of
going
long
distances
to
transact
business
;
;

When
they
were
refused
entrance
to
his
brother's
house
nearby
,
they
smashed
down
the
door
,
broke
the
window
,
and
threw
lighted
clothes
wet
with
kerosene
into
the
room
.

The
posse
then
asked
that
he
send
out
the
women
and
children
as
the
building
would
be
fired
or
torn
down
over
his
head
if
necessary
to
take
him
dead
or
alive
.

When
the
house
was
about
half
consumed
,
his
comrade
ran
to
the
door
and
threw
up
his
hands
,
declaring
repeatedly
that
he
did
not
know
the
whereabouts
of
Manuel
.

The
sheriff
and
District
Attorney
Mills
hastily
swore
out
a
number
of
warrants
against
men
who
had
been
riding
about
armed
,
according
to
signed
statements
by
Chavez
and
Dr.
I.
P.
George
,
and
ordered
Deputy
Barney
Clark
of
Raton
to
rescue
the
posseman
.

Traveling
all
night
,
Clark
and
twelve
men
arrived
at
about
seven
o'clock
May
22
.

Occasionally
they
heard
gun-shot
signals
and
a
number
of
horsemen
were
sighted
on
the
hills
,
disappearing
at
the
posse's
approach
.

It
has
given
considerable
trouble
at
times
and
empties
right
into
the
Battenkill
.

Shares
of
capital
stock
at
$15
each
in
the
latter
company
were
payable
at
the
Bank
of
Manchester
or
at
various
other
Vermont
banks
.

By
1871
L.
C.
Orvis
,
manager
of
the
``
Western
Union
Telegraph
Company
''
,
expressed
willingness
to
send
emergency
telegrams
on
Sundays
from
his
Village
drugstore
.

Early
equipment
was
very
flimsy
;
;

Two
companies
now
had
headquarters
with
Clark
J.
Wait
,
who
by
then
had
his
own
drugstore
at
Factory
Point
--
the
``
Northern
Union
Telegraph
Company
''
and
the
``
Western
Union
''
.

Operators
were
Arthur
Koop
and
Norman
Taylor
.

The
Village
office
of
Western
Union
with
George
Towsley
as
manager
and
telegrapher
continued
in
Hard's
drugstore
until
1905
.

This
boosted
local
telegraph
business
and
Manchester
basked
in
all
the
free
advertising
.

In
his
wake
came
the
District
Traffic
Supervisor
and
the
cream
of
the
telegraphic
profession
,
ten
of
Boston's
best
,
chosen
for
their
long
experience
and
thorough
knowledge
of
golf
.

In
November
1887
a
line
connecting
several
dwelling
houses
in
Dorset
was
extended
to
Manchester
Depot
.

George
Woodcock
was
manager
and
troubleshooter
;
;

More
aerial
and
underground
equipment
was
installed
as
well
as
office
improvements
to
take
care
of
the
expanding
business
.

Another
veteran
telephone
operator
was
Edith
Fleming
Blackmer
,
who
had
been
in
the
office
forty
years
at
the
time
of
her
death
in
1960
.

electricity
plays
such
an
important
part
in
community
life
today
that
it
is
difficult
to
envision
a
time
when
current
was
not
available
for
daily
use
.

Yet
one
has
to
go
back
only
some
sixty
years
.

In
November
1900
surveying
was
done
under
John
Marsden
on
the
east
mountains
to
ascertain
if
it
would
be
possible
to
get
sufficient
water
and
fall
to
operate
an
electric
power
plant
.

It
was
at
the
end
of
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
Dellwood
Cemetery
cottage
.

Marsden
was
manager
of
the
company
for
ten
years
and
manager
of
its
successor
company
,
the
Colonial
Light
and
Power
Company
,
for
one
year
.

This
was
fortunate
,
as
the
Vail
plant
burned
in
1905
.

It
overlooks
the
other
fact
that
it
is
described
as
``
Nec
minus
salutaris
quam
festivus
''
,
``
no
less
salutary
than
gay
''
.

Only
one
other
contemporary
of
More's
evokes
so
immediate
and
direct
a
response
,
and
only
one
other
contemporary
work
--
Niccolo
Machiavelli
and
The
Prince
.

we
do
not
even
need
to
commit
ourselves
to
assessing
on
the
same
inconceivable
scale
the
relative
importance
of
the
medieval
,
the
Renaissance
,
and
the
modern
.

Surely
there
is
nothing
new
about
communism
.

We
find
it
in
that
``
common
way
of
life
pleasing
to
Christ
and
still
in
use
among
the
truest
societies
of
Christians
''
,
that
is
,
the
better
monasteries
which
made
it
easier
to
convert
the
Utopians
to
Christianity
.

We
find
it
in
the
later
Stoic
conception
of
man's
natural
condition
which
included
the
community
of
all
possessions
.

But
although
the
idea
of
communism
is
very
old
even
in
More's
day
and
did
not
spring
full-clad
from
his
imagination
in
1515
,
it
is
not
communism
as
such
that
we
are
concerned
with
.

Its
function
is
to
separate
from
the
base
ruled
mass
,
among
whom
private
ownership
prevails
,
the
governing
warrior
elite
.

and
it
is
to
this
problem
that
the
Republic
ultimately
returns
.

Utopian
communism
applies
to
all
Utopians
.

Because
community
not
severalty
of
property
is
the
law
of
nature
no
man
can
assert
an
absolutely
unalterable
right
to
what
is
his
.

He
is
a
trustee
for
the
common
good
,
however
feeble
the
safeguards
which
the
positive
or
municipal
law
of
property
provides
against
his
misuse
of
that
share
of
the
common
fund
,
wisely
or
unwisely
,
entrusted
to
his
keeping
.

We
do
not
deny
originality
to
the
Agamemnon
because
Aeschylus
found
the
tales
of
the
house
of
Atreus
among
the
folk
lore
of
the
Greeks
.

It
is
not
merely
a
new
thing
;
;

democratic
and
secret
elections
of
all
officers
including
priests
,
meals
taken
publicly
in
common
refectories
;
;

six
hours
of
manual
labor
a
day
for
all
but
a
handful
of
magistrates
and
scholars
,
and
careful
measures
to
prevent
anyone
from
shirking
;
;

no
sort
of
pricing
at
all
for
any
goods
or
services
,
and
therefore
no
market
in
the
economic
sense
of
the
term
.

During
the
Brown
trial
,
however
,
the
state's
most
powerful
Democratic
newspaper
,
the
Providence
Daily
Post
,
stated
that
Brown
was
a
murderer
,
a
man
of
blood
,
and
that
he
and
his
associates
,
with
the
assistance
of
Republicans
and
Abolitionists
,
had
plotted
not
only
the
liberation
of
the
slaves
but
also
the
overthrow
of
state
and
federal
governments
.

Editor
Foss
stated
,
``
Of
their
guilt
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
they
are
entitled
to
sufficient
time
to
prepare
for
trial
,
and
a
fair
trial
''
.

On
Wednesday
morning
,
November
2
,
1859
,
the
Providence
Daily
Journal
stated
that
although
Brown
justly
deserved
the
extreme
penalty
,
no
man
,
however
criminal
,
ought
to
suffer
the
penalty
without
a
fair
trial
.

The
results
of
the
election
of
1859
found
Republican
candidates
not
only
winning
the
offices
of
governor
and
lieutenant-governor
but
also
obtaining
the
two
Congressional
offices
from
the
eastern
and
western
sections
of
the
state
.

Most
attempts
to
develop
any
sympathy
for
Brown
and
his
actions
found
an
unresponsive
audience
in
Rhode
Island
.

The
Woonsocket
Patriot
admitted
that
John
Brown
might
deserve
punishment
or
imprisonment
``
but
he
should
no
more
be
hung
than
Henry
A.
Wise
or
James
Buchanan
''
.

On
November
22
,
1859
,
the
Providence
Daily
Journal
stated
that
although
Brown's
``
pluck
''
and
honest
fanaticism
must
be
admired
,
any
honor
paid
to
Brown
would
only
induce
other
fanatics
to
imitate
his
actions
.

Daniel
W.
Vaughan
,
and
William
H.
H.
Clements
.

He
spoke
of
his
desire
to
promote
the
abolition
of
slavery
by
peaceable
means
and
he
compared
John
Brown
of
Harper's
Ferry
to
the
John
Brown
of
Rhode
Island's
colonial
period
.

The
next
speaker
was
George
T.
Day
.

He
said
that
the
propriety
or
impropriety
of
such
a
gathering
was
a
question
that
was
to
be
settled
by
every
man
in
accordance
with
the
convictions
of
private
judgments
.

He
recalled
that
in
Rhode
Island
a
party
opposed
to
the
state's
condemnation
of
a
man
(
Thomas
W.
Dorr
)
proclaimed
the
state's
action
as
a
violation
of
the
law
of
the
land
and
the
principles
of
human
liberty
.

Resolved
that
his
wrongs
and
bereavements
in
Kansas
,
occasioned
by
the
violence
and
brutality
of
those
who
were
intent
on
the
propagation
of
slavery
in
that
territory
,
call
for
a
charitable
judgment
upon
his
recent
efforts
in
Virginia
to
undermine
the
despotism
from
which
he
had
suffered
,
and
commend
his
family
to
the
special
sympathy
and
aid
of
all
who
pity
suffering
and
reverence
justice
.

On
the
morning
following
the
Pratt
Hall
meeting
the
editor
of
the
Providence
Daily
Journal
wrote
that
although
the
meeting
was
milder
and
less
extreme
than
those
held
in
other
areas
for
similar
purposes
,
it
could
have
been
avoided
completely
.

Rather
than
being
deceived
,
the
eye
is
puzzled
;
;

In
certain
other
pictures
,
however
,
Braque
began
to
paint
areas
in
exact
simulation
of
wood
graining
or
marbleizing
.

The
process
of
flattening
seemed
inexorable
,
and
it
became
necessary
to
emphasize
the
surface
still
further
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
fusing
with
the
illusion
.

In
their
very
first
collages
,
Braque
and
Picasso
draw
or
paint
over
and
on
the
affixed
paper
or
cloth
,
so
that
certain
of
the
principal
features
of
their
subjects
as
depicted
seem
to
thrust
out
into
real
,
bas-relief
space
--
or
to
be
about
to
do
so
--
while
the
rest
of
the
subject
remains
imbedded
in
,
or
flat
upon
,
the
surface
.

In
the
upper
center
of
Braque's
first
collage
,
Fruit
Dish
(
in
Douglas
Cooper's
collection
)
,
a
bunch
of
grapes
is
rendered
with
such
conventionally
vivid
sculptural
effect
as
to
lift
it
practically
off
the
picture
plane
.

For
it
had
turned
out
,
by
a
further
paradox
of
Cubism
,
that
the
means
to
an
illusion
of
depth
and
plasticity
had
now
become
widely
divergent
from
the
means
of
representation
or
imaging
.

In
the
Analytical
phase
of
their
Cubism
,
Braque
and
Picasso
had
not
only
had
to
minimize
three-dimensionality
simply
in
order
to
preserve
it
;
;

and
as
the
aspect
of
the
subject
was
transposed
into
those
clusters
of
more
or
less
interchangeable
and
contour-obliterating
facet-planes
by
which
plasticity
was
isolated
under
the
Cubist
method
,
the
subject
itself
became
largely
unrecognizable
.

If
they
opted
for
illusion
,
it
could
only
be
illusion
per
se
--
an
illusion
of
depth
,
and
of
relief
,
so
general
and
abstracted
as
to
exclude
the
representation
of
individual
objects
.

this
was
the
point
at
which
he
finally
took
the
lead
in
Cubist
innovation
away
from
Braque
,
never
again
to
relinquish
it
.

But
even
before
that
,
Picasso
had
glimpsed
and
entered
,
for
a
moment
,
a
certain
revolutionary
path
in
which
no
one
had
preceded
him
.

Some
time
in
1912
,
Picasso
cut
out
and
folded
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
shape
of
a
guitar
;
;

to
this
he
glued
and
fitted
other
pieces
of
paper
and
four
taut
strings
,
thus
creating
a
sequence
of
flat
surfaces
in
real
and
sculptural
space
to
which
there
clung
only
the
vestige
of
a
picture
plane
.

Los
Angeles
in
1957
finally
bowed
to
the
skyscraper
.

It
is
hard
to
believe
that
this
mass
of
intertwined
concrete
constitutes
what
the
law
calls
``
the
highest
and
best
use
''
of
centrally
located
urban
land
.

it
removes
forever
from
the
tax
rolls
property
which
should
be
taxed
to
pay
for
the
city
services
.

The
freeway
with
narrowly
spaced
interchanges
concentrates
and
mitigates
the
access
problem
,
but
it
also
acts
inevitably
as
an
artificial
,
isolating
boundary
.

Meanwhile
,
the
automobile
and
its
friend
the
truck
have
cost
the
central
city
some
of
its
industrial
dominance
.

This
movement
of
industry
away
from
the
central
cities
is
not
so
catastrophically
new
as
some
prophets
seem
to
believe
.

The
railroad
siding
is
still
important
--
it
is
usually
,
though
not
always
,
true
that
long-haul
shipment
by
rail
is
cheaper
than
trucking
.

And
there
are
now
many
millions
of
workers
for
whom
the
factory
with
the
big
parking
lot
,
which
can
be
reached
by
driving
across
or
against
the
usual
pattern
of
rush
hour
traffic
and
grille-route
bus
lines
,
is
actually
more
convenient
than
the
walk-to
factory
.

They
are
all
suburban
plants
,
relying
on
the
roads
to
keep
them
supplied
with
workers
.

While
the
factories
were
always
the
center
of
the
labor
market
,
they
were
often
on
the
city's
periphery
.

In
spreading
the
factories
even
farther
,
the
automobile
may
not
have
changed
to
any
great
extent
the
growth
pattern
of
the
cities
.

What
hurts
most
is
the
damage
the
automobile
has
done
to
central-city
retailing
,
especially
in
those
cities
where
public
transit
is
feeble
.

But
whenever
a
major
purchase
was
contemplated
forty
years
ago
--
a
new
bedroom
set
or
a
winter
coat
,
an
Easter
bonnet
,
a
bicycle
for
Junior
--
the
family
set
off
for
the
downtown
department
store
,
where
the
selection
would
be
greatest
.

These
stores
are
still
there
,
but
the
volume
of
the
``
downtown
store
''
has
been
on
a
relative
decline
,
while
in
many
cities
the
suburban
``
branch
''
sells
more
and
more
dry
goods
.

In
most
discussions
of
this
phenomenon
,
the
figures
are
substantially
inflated
.

In
many
cases
that
statement
--
``
We
break
even
on
our
downtown
operation
and
make
money
on
our
branches
''
--
would
be
turned
around
if
the
cost
analysis
were
recalculated
on
terms
less
prejudicial
to
the
old
store
.

Moreover
,
the
cost
of
operations
is
always
high
in
any
new
store
,
as
the
conservative
bankers
who
act
as
controllers
for
retail
giants
are
beginning
to
discover
.

Just
as
the
suburban
factory
may
be
more
convenient
than
the
downtown
plant
to
the
worker
with
a
car
,
the
trip
to
the
shopping
center
may
seem
far
easier
than
to
the
downtown
department
store
,
though
both
are
the
same
distance
from
home
.

And
if
the
affection
for
the
suburban
branch
reflects
a
desire
to
shop
with
``
nice
people
''
,
rather
than
with
the
indiscriminate
urban
mass
which
supports
the
downtown
department
store
,
the
central
location
may
be
in
serious
trouble
.

Today
,
according
to
land
economist
Homer
Hoyt
,
shopping
centers
and
their
associated
parking
lots
cover
some
46,000
acres
of
land
,
which
is
almost
exactly
the
total
land
area
in
all
the
nation's
Central
Business
Districts
put
together
.

If
anything
may
be
predicted
in
the
quicksilver
world
of
retailing
,
it
seems
likely
that
the
suburban
branch
will
come
to
dominate
children's
clothing
(
taking
the
kid
downtown
is
too
much
of
a
production
)
,
household
gadgetry
and
the
discount
business
in
big-ticket
items
.

Department
stores
were
built
on
dry
goods
,
especially
ladies'
fashions
,
and
in
this
area
,
in
the
long
run
,
the
suburban
branches
will
be
hard
put
to
compete
against
downtown
.

Historically
in
America
the
appeal
of
cities
has
been
their
color
and
life
,
the
variety
of
experience
they
offered
.

At
the
same
time
,
Roosevelt's
Federal
Housing
Administration
,
coupled
with
Henry
Morgenthau's
cheap-money
policy
,
permitted
ordinary
lower-middle-class
families
to
build
their
own
homes
.

Bankers
who
had
been
reluctant
to
lend
without
better
security
than
the
house
itself
got
that
security
from
the
U.
S.
government
;
;

When
Costaggini
had
used
up
all
the
sketches
thirty-six
feet
of
empty
frieze
were
left
over
.

Then
,
advised
by
the
Architect
of
the
Capitol
,
the
Joint
Committee
for
the
Library
,
traditionally
responsible
for
the
works
of
art
in
the
building
,
ordered
the
space
cleared
and
painted
in
fresco
,
to
show
``
the
Peace
after
the
Civil
War
''
,
``
the
Spanish-American
War
''
,
and
``
the
Birth
of
Aviation
''
,
to
match
as
nearly
as
feasible
Brumidi's
technique
and
composition
.

Later
the
cleaning
and
restoration
were
ordered
,
first
of
the
older
part
of
the
frieze
,
finally
of
the
canopy
.

and
we
were
able
to
decide
on
some
amplification
of
scale
.

What
bits
of
Brumidi
and
Costaggini
could
be
reached
at
either
end
seemed
in
good
order
,
though
the
roughish
sandy
surface
was
thick
with
dust
.

It
could
be
seen
that
both
artists
used
a
very
thick
final
coat
of
plaster
,
one
half
inch
,
and
that
both
followed
the
traditional
Italian
fresco
technique
as
described
by
Cennino
Cennini
in
the
14th
Century
,
and
current
in
Italy
to
this
day
.

In
our
own
practice
,
to
have
the
last
``
intonaco
''
plaster
coat
thick
enough
to
match
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
fine
cracks
in
drying
,
we
found
that
it
had
to
be
put
on
in
two
layers
,
letting
the
first
set
awhile
before
applying
the
second
.

The
new
part
is
finished
.

One
is
led
to
speculate
as
to
why
the
empty
space
was
there
,
left
for
our
century
to
finish
.

The
startlingly
bright
effect
of
the
first
washings
led
the
Committee
to
order
the
rest
of
the
Brumidi-Costaggini
cycle
cleaned
and
restored
to
go
with
them
.

Every
few
days
,
in
the
early
morning
,
as
the
work
progressed
,
twenty
men
would
appear
to
push
it
ahead
and
to
shift
the
plank
foundation
that
distributed
its
weight
widely
on
the
Rotunda
pavement
,
supported
as
it
is
by
ancient
brick
vaulting
.

A
most
useful
tool
for
wetting
the
surface
without
running
down
was
made
from
a
greenhouse
``
mist
spray
''
nozzle
welded
to
a
hose
connection
,
to
be
used
at
low
water
pressure
.

In
parts
a
repeated
sponging
was
needed
,
but
everywhere
we
found
that
water
alone
was
enough
to
restore
the
original
brightness
.

The
greatest
source
of
trouble
was
rain
which
had
repeatedly
flowed
from
openings
above
,
soaking
the
surface
and
leaving
streaks
of
dissolved
lime
,
very
conspicuous
even
after
cleaning
,
particularly
in
the
``
Landing
of
Columbus
''
,
``
Oglethorpe
and
the
Indians
''
,
and
``
Yorktown
''
.

I
am
very
pleased
that
quite
a
number
of
you
found
ways
to
communicate
to
me
your
desire
to
hear
of
our
reactions
and
experiences
in
the
U.S.S.R.
.

Too
much
damage
is
done
by
``
experts
''
who
have
spent
even
less
time
,
if
any
at
all
,
in
the
U.S.S.R.
.

That
which
I
found
most
profound
and
most
disturbing
appeared
to
evoke
a
curiously
muted
reaction
.

Apparently
this
is
not
the
time
and
the
climate
in
which
people
will
listen
objectively
,
or
at
least
dispassionately
,
to
individual
impressions
of
a
subject
which
preoccupies
a
good
deal
of
their
waking
moments
.

It
cannot
be
said
that
our
very
first
day
in
the
Soviet
Union
turned
out
to
be
an
ordinary
one
.

Just
yesterday
we
had
met
and
talked
with
a
living
writer
,
a
contemporary
of
the
dead
poet
,
who
is
known
for
his
ability
of
manipulating
his
ideas
and
his
craft
more
advantageously
.

But
today
we
were
aware
of
only
two
men
.

The
flowers
on
his
grave
attested
to
the
fact
that
he
as
well
was
somebody's
hero
.

These
two
recollections
form
the
frame
around
a
series
of
experiences
and
sights
which
,
to
me
at
least
,
symbolize
the
extremes
in
the
aesthetic
as
well
as
ethical
conflict
between
materialism
and
humanism
.

The
socialist
environment
,
it
was
stated
,
had
cross-fertilized
these
two
extreme
seeds
and
was
about
to
produce
a
new
plant
and
fruit
.

No
wonder
that
Pozzatti
and
I
had
at
times
difficulty
in
remembering
the
real
purpose
of
our
presence
,
namely
,
Cultural
Exchange
.

Pozzatti
and
I
could
not
know
then
that
we
would
experience
this
sort
of
treatment
more
often
in
Moscow
than
elsewhere
.

and
,
furthermore
,
I
could
not
presume
the
implication
that
I
spoke
for
American
artists
as
a
group
.

Our
presence
here
should
also
be
considered
further
,
sincere
evidence
of
the
attempts
by
our
people
and
their
chosen
government
to
seek
any
and
all
possible
ways
to
effect
closer
,
peaceful
ties
among
all
people
.

A
work
so
broad
,
even
when
it
is
directed
by
a
leading
idea
and
informed
by
a
moral
vision
,
must
necessarily
``
fail
''
.

Even
a
hasty
reader
will
easily
find
in
it
numerous
blind
spots
,
errors
of
fact
and
argument
,
important
exclusions
,
areas
of
ignorance
and
prejudice
,
undue
emphases
on
trivia
,
examples
of
broad
positions
supported
by
flimsy
evidence
,
and
the
like
.

Such
books
are
easy
prey
for
critics
.

The
thing
can
be
made
to
look
like
the
cluttered
attic
of
a
large
and
vigorous
family
--
a
motley
jumble
of
discarded
objects
,
some
outworn
and
some
that
were
never
useful
,
some
once
whole
and
bright
but
now
chipped
and
tarnished
,
some
odd
pieces
whose
history
no
one
remembers
,
here
and
there
a
gem
,
everything
fascinating
because
it
suggests
some
part
of
the
human
condition
--
the
whole
adding
up
to
nothing
more
than
a
glimpse
into
the
disorderly
history
of
the
makers
and
users
.

Since
I
have
already
discussed
his
moral
position
,
that
discussion
is
incorporated
by
reference
into
the
following
pages
,
which
will
focus
on
the
empirical
and
analytic
side
of
Fromm's
treatment
.

The
idea
has
received
much
attention
in
philosophy
,
in
literature
,
and
in
a
few
works
of
general
social
criticism
,
such
as
The
Sane
Society
.

For
all
these
points
he
relies
exclusively
on
Berle
and
Means's
study
of
1932
,
The
Modern
Corporation
And
Private
Property
.

Fromm
seems
unaware
of
these
developments
.

Or
,
he
might
remind
Fromm
that
the
41
per
cent
figure
is
really
astonishingly
low
:
after
all
,
the
medieval
guild
system
was
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
100
per
cent
of
the
workers
ought
to
turn
out
only
the
average
amount
;
;

``
Are
people
happy
,
are
they
as
satisfied
,
unconsciously
,
as
they
believe
themselves
to
be
?
?

Sometimes
he
uses
it
as
a
subjective
,
descriptive
term
,
and
sometimes
as
an
objective
,
diagnostic
one
.

While
the
``
empirical
psychoanalytic
''
label
which
Fromm
claims
sheds
no
light
on
the
validity
of
his
underlying
philosophy
,
it
does
increase
the
marketability
of
his
product
.

For
Fromm
,
capitalism
is
the
enemy
,
the
root
of
all
evil
.

If
one
characteristic
distinguishes
Boris
Godunov
,
it
is
the
consistency
with
which
every
person
on
the
stage
--
including
the
chorus
--
comes
alive
in
the
music
.

Much
of
this
lifelike
quality
results
from
Mussorgsky's
care
in
basing
his
vocal
line
on
natural
speech
inflections
.

Even
then
,
the
flexibility
of
the
phrasing
suggests
that
the
word
comes
first
in
importance
.

each
musical
setting
has
an
individual
touch
.

A
quiet
but
sturdy
theme
,
somewhat
folklike
in
character
,
appears
whenever
the
old
monk
speaks
of
the
history
he
is
recording
or
of
his
own
past
life
:

)

a
clever
naturalistic
touch
is
Varlaam's
labored
reading
of
the
warrant
.

The
music
becomes
ethereal
as
he
calls
up
a
vision
of
her
own
sainthood
:
it
is
she
,
he
tells
her
,
who
can
bring
the
truth
to
Russia
and
convert
the
heretics
.

As
if
in
a
trance
,
she
repeats
his
words
--
then
realizes
,
with
a
shock
,
her
own
audacity
.

This
is
no
assignment
for
a
frivolous
girl
,
she
assures
him
.

Another
theme
,
sinuously
chromatic
,
appears
as
he
directs
her
to
gain
power
over
Grigori
by
any
means
,
even
at
the
cost
of
her
honor
.

the
conflict
is
not
Boris
versus
Grigori
or
Shuiski
or
even
the
ghost
of
the
murdered
child
,
but
Boris
versus
the
Russian
people
.

One
reason
for
the
unique
vitality
of
the
chorus
is
its
great
variety
in
expression
.

In
many
passages
--
for
example
,
the
council
of
boyars
--
each
section
of
the
chorus
becomes
a
character
group
with
a
particular
opinion
.

They
will
kneel
and
plead
for
Boris'
leadership
in
a
strangely
intense
song
,
its
phrases
irregularly
broken
as
if
gasping
for
breath
,
but
when
the
police
with
their
cudgels
move
away
,
they
mock
and
grumble
and
fight
among
themselves
.

And
Mityukh
,
apparently
the
intellectual
leader
of
the
crowd
,
replies
that
he
has
no
notion
.

In
Pimen's
cell
the
soft
prayers
of
the
monks
,
heard
from
offstage
,
not
only
help
to
set
the
scene
but
emphasize
the
contrast
between
young
Grigori's
thoughts
and
his
situation
.

Though
brief
,
it
has
a
sharp
dramatic
edge
and
great
poignancy
.

The
mayhem
in
the
forest
of
Kromy
is
a
natural
sequel
.

The
St.
Basil's
scene
opens
with
little
groups
of
beggars
milling
around
the
square
,
the
ever
present
police
keeping
them
under
scrutiny
.

In
the
orchestra
we
hear
first
a
hushed
,
hesitant
pizzicato
figure
,
then
the
insistent
``
police
''
motif
as
it
appeared
in
the
opening
scene
.

This
is
not
,
however
,
the
case
,
and
development
is
a
term
which
we
can
apply
to
Hardy
only
in
a
very
limited
sense
.

In
a
time
when
poetic
style
,
and
poetic
belief
as
well
,
seem
in
a
state
of
continual
flux
,
Hardy
stands
out
as
a
poet
of
almost
perverse
consistency
.

the
``
sober
opinion
''
of
his
letter
to
Noyes
,
written
when
Hardy
was
eighty
years
old
,
is
essentially
that
of
his
first
``
philosophical
''
notebook
entry
,
made
when
he
was
twenty-five
:
``
The
world
does
not
despise
us
:
it
only
neglects
us
''
(
Early
Life
,
p.
63
)
.

About
a
quarter
of
Hardy's
poems
carry
an
appended
date
line
,
usually
the
year
of
completion
,
but
sometimes
inclusive
years
(
``
1908
-
1910
''
)
or
two
separate
dates
when
Hardy
worked
on
the
poem
(
``
1905
and
1926
''
)
or
an
approximate
date
(
``
During
the
War
''
)
.

The
dated
poems
also
give
us
an
idea
of
the
degree
to
which
Hardy
drew
upon
past
productions
for
his
various
volumes
,
and
therefore
probably
are
an
indication
of
the
amount
of
poetry
he
was
writing
at
the
time
.

Satires
Of
Circumstance
and
Moments
Of
Vision
,
coming
during
his
most
productive
decade
,
are
relatively
self-contained
;
;

but
resumed
it
later
''
)
.

After
1895
the
number
increases
,
and
in
the
next
thirty
years
there
is
only
one
year
for
which
there
is
no
dated
poem
--
1903
,
when
Hardy
was
at
work
on
The
Dynasts
.

We
may
carry
this
sequence
one
step
further
and
say
that
at
seventy
he
was
a
poet
at
the
height
of
his
powers
,
wanting
only
the
impetus
of
two
tragedies
,
one
personal
,
the
other
national
,
to
loose
those
powers
in
poetry
.

The
language
is
the
conventional
language
of
the
form
;
;

there
is
no
phrase
or
image
that
sounds
like
Hardy
or
that
is
striking
enough
to
give
individuality
to
the
poem
.

In
``
Revulsion
''
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
pessimism
is
a
case
not
proven
;
;

In
the
1860
-
70
decade
there
are
many
poems
like
``
Revulsion
''
,
but
there
is
only
one
``
Neutral
Tones
''
.

Hardy
was
not
Hardy
very
often
.

The
``
Poems
of
1912
-
13
''
offer
a
good
example
of
Hardy's
style
as
it
was
manifested
in
the
later
productive
decade
.

Hardy
obviously
felt
that
these
poems
were
peculiarly
personal
and
private
;
;

the
fire
of
love
is
dead
,
and
Hardy
stands
,
as
the
speaker
does
in
the
last
poem
of
the
sequence
,
over
the
burnt
circle
of
charred
sticks
,
and
thinks
of
past
happiness
and
present
grief
,
honest
and
uncomforted
.

``
Disaffiliation
''
,
by
the
way
,
is
the
term
used
by
the
critic
and
poet
,
Lawrence
Lipton
,
who
has
written
several
articles
on
this
subject
,
the
first
of
which
,
in
The
Nation
,
quoted
as
Epigraph
:
``
We
disaffiliate
.

Like
the
pillars
of
Hercules
,
like
two
ruined
Titans
guarding
the
entrance
to
one
of
Dante's
circles
,
stand
two
great
dead
juvenile
delinquents
--
the
heroes
of
the
post-war
generation
:
the
great
saxophonist
,
Charlie
Parker
,
and
Dylan
Thomas
.

So
as
the
years
passed
,
I
saw
them
each
time
in
the
light
of
an
accelerated
personal
conflagration
.

I
said
,
referring
to
the
pretentious
``
Jazz
Concert
''
.

But
this
fluent
,
enchanting
utterance
had
,
compared
with
important
artists
of
the
past
,
relatively
little
content
.

Horace's
column
of
imperishable
verse
shines
quietly
enough
in
the
lucid
air
of
Augustan
Rome
.

I
think
all
this
could
apply
to
Parker
just
as
well
,
although
,
because
of
the
nature
of
music
,
it
is
not
demonstrable
--
at
least
not
conclusively
.

The
tonal
novelties
consist
in
the
introduction
of
a
few
chords
used
in
classical
music
for
centuries
.

And
there
is
less
rhythmic
difference
between
progressive
jazz
,
no
matter
how
progressive
,
and
Dixieland
,
than
there
is
between
two
movements
of
many
conventional
symphonies
.

It
is
true
of
the
rhythmic
pattern
in
which
the
beat
shifts
continuously
,
or
at
least
is
continuously
sprung
,
so
that
it
becomes
ambiguous
enough
to
allow
the
pattern
to
be
dominated
by
the
long
pulsations
of
the
phrase
or
strophe
.

The
special
syntactical
effects
of
a
Rimbaud
or
an
Edith
Sitwell
--
actually
ornaments
--
become
the
main
concern
.

The
metaphysical
conceits
,
which
fascinate
the
Reactionary
Generation
still
dominant
in
backwater
American
colleges
,
were
embroideries
.

Thomas's
ellipses
and
ambiguities
are
ends
in
themselves
.

The
immediate
theme
,
if
it
exists
,
is
incidental
,
and
his
main
theme
--
the
terror
of
birth
--
is
simply
reiterated
.

it
resembles
Mozart
.

Partly
this
difference
is
due
to
the
nature
of
verbal
communication
.

The
insistent
talk-aboutiveness
of
the
general
environment
obtrudes
into
even
the
most
idyllic
poetry
.

A
poem
by
Dylan
Thomas
,
a
saxophone
solo
by
Charles
Parker
,
a
painting
by
Jackson
Pollock
--
these
are
pure
confabulations
as
ends
in
themselves
.

Confabulation
has
come
to
determine
structure
.

The
point
is
that
many
of
the
most
impressive
developments
in
the
arts
nowadays
are
aberrant
,
idiosyncratic
.

I
doubt
if
anyone
holds
such
ideas
today
.

Nothing
looks
anything
like
an
Ernst
or
an
Arp
but
another
Ernst
or
Arp
.

It
is
curious
that
at
its
best
,
the
work
of
this
school
of
painting
--
Mark
Rothko
,
Jackson
Pollock
,
Clyfford
Still
,
Robert
Motherwell
,
Willem
De-Kooning
,
and
the
rest
--
resembles
nothing
so
much
as
the
passage
painting
of
quite
unimpressive
painters
:
the
mother-of-pearl
shimmer
in
the
background
of
a
Henry
McFee
,
itself
a
formula
derived
from
Renoir
;
;

A
Tiepolo
painting
,
however
confabulated
,
is
a
universe
of
tensions
in
vast
depths
.

A
process
of
elimination
which
leaves
the
artist
with
nothing
but
the
play
of
his
materials
themselves
cannot
sustain
interest
in
either
artist
or
public
for
very
long
.

So
,
in
the
last
couple
of
years
,
abstract
expressionism
has
tended
toward
romantic
suggestion
--
indications
of
landscape
or
living
figures
.

Alcinous'
court
bard
sings
of
the
discovered
adultery
of
Ares
and
Aphrodite
(
Odyssey
8
266-366
)
,
and
takes
up
a
tale
of
Odysseus
while
the
Ithacan
wanderer
listens
on
(
Odyssey
8
499-520
)
.

the
poet
of
The
Odyssey
,
reputed
blind
,
reveals
himself
not
at
all
in
singing
of
the
blind
minstrel
Demodocus
.

Since
none
of
these
glimpses
of
poetizing
without
writing
is
intended
to
incorporate
a
signature
into
the
epic
matter
,
there
is
prima-facie
evidence
that
Beowulf
and
the
Homeric
poems
each
derive
from
an
oral
tradition
.

he
further
reasoned
that
frequent
formulas
in
epic
verse
indicate
oral
composition
,
and
assumed
the
slightly
less
likely
corollary
that
oral
epic
is
inclined
towards
the
use
of
formulas
.

Combellack
argues
further
,
and
here
he
makes
his
main
point
,
that
once
The
Iliad
and
The
Odyssey
are
thought
formulaic
poems
composed
for
an
audience
accustomed
to
formulaic
poetry
,
Homeric
critics
are
deprived
of
an
entire
domain
they
previously
found
arable
.

To
the
extent
that
a
language
is
formulaic
,
its
individual
components
must
be
regarded
as
no
more
distinguished
than
other
cliches
.

It
is
false
to
be
certain
of
having
discovered
in
the
language
of
Beowulf
such
effects
as
intentional
irony
.

Time-servers
,
though
the
periphrastic
expressions
are
,
they
may
nevertheless
be
handsome
or
ironic
or
humorous
.

True
,
we
do
not
know
how
they
were
regarded
in
their
day
,
but
we
need
not
believe
the
epic
audience
to
have
been
more
insensitive
to
the
formulas
than
the
numerous
scholars
of
modern
times
who
have
read
Germanic
or
Homeric
poetry
all
their
lives
and
still
found
much
to
admire
in
occasional
occurrences
of
the
most
familiar
phrases
.

in
an
oral
tradition
they
may
be
chosen
for
the
entire
epic
corpus
,
and
tend
towards
idealization
rather
than
distinctive
delineation
.

at
some
stage
in
their
evolution
they
were
transcribed
.

The
closest
scrutiny
is
owed
to
the
Anglo-Saxon
kennings
and
the
Homeric
epithets
;
;

The
Iliad
has
two
words
for
the
shield
,
ASPIS
and
SAKOS
.

We
have
only
to
think
of
Lady
Macbeth
or
the
policeman-murderer
in
Thomas
Burke's
famous
story
,
``
The
Hands
Of
Mr.
Ottermole
''
,
to
realize
that
hands
often
call
up
ideas
of
crime
and
punishment
.

As
Pip
agonizes
over
the
theft
that
his
own
hands
have
committed
,
his
guilty
conscience
projects
itself
upon
the
wooden
finger
of
a
local
signpost
,
transforming
it
into
``
a
phantom
devoting
me
to
the
Hulks
''
.

later
he
flees
in
panic
from
the
family
table
just
as
his
theft
is
about
to
be
discovered
and
is
blocked
at
the
front
door
by
a
soldier
who
accusingly
holds
out
a
pair
of
handcuffs
which
he
has
brought
to
Gargery's
forge
for
mending
.

Dickens
,
for
excellent
psychological
reasons
,
never
fully
reveals
Magwitch's
felonious
past
,
but
Pip
,
at
the
convict's
climactic
reappearance
in
London
,
shrinks
from
clasping
a
hand
which
he
fears
``
might
be
stained
with
blood
''
.

Orlick
slouches
about
the
forge
``
like
Cain
''
with
``
his
hands
in
his
pockets
''
,
and
when
he
shouts
abuse
at
Mrs.
Joe
for
objecting
to
his
holiday
,
she
claps
her
hands
in
a
tantrum
,
beats
them
``
upon
her
bosom
and
upon
her
knees
''
,
and
clenches
them
in
her
husband's
hair
.

The
scarred
,
disfigured
wrists
of
Mr.
Jaggers'
housekeeper
are
the
tell-tale
marks
of
her
sinister
past
,
for
her
master
,
coolly
exhibiting
them
to
his
dinner
guests
,
makes
a
point
of
the
``
force
of
grip
there
is
in
these
hands
''
.

It
is
the
similarity
between
Estella's
hands
and
Molly's
(
``
The
action
of
her
fingers
was
like
the
action
of
knitting
''
)
that
provides
Pip
with
a
vital
clue
to
the
real
identity
of
both
and
establishes
a
symbolic
connection
between
the
underworld
of
crime
and
the
genteel
cruelty
of
Satis
House
.

Pip's
great
expectations
,
his
progress
through
illusion
and
disillusionment
,
turn
,
somewhat
as
they
do
for
the
naive
hero
of
Dreiser's
American
Tragedy
,
upon
the
lure
of
genteel
prosperity
through
unearned
income
--
what
Wemmick
calls
``
portable
property
''
and
what
Jaggers
reproaches
Pip
for
letting
``
slip
through
(
his
)
fingers
''
.

In
both
cases
the
finger-post
represents
Pip's
heightened
awareness
of
contrary
magnetisms
.

The
vulture-like
attendance
of
the
Pocket
family
upon
Miss
Havisham
is
summed
up
in
the
hypocritical
gestures
of
Miss
Camilla
Pocket
,
who
puts
her
hand
to
her
throat
in
a
feigned
spasm
of
grief-stricken
choking
,
then
lays
it
``
upon
her
heaving
bosom
''
with
``
an
unnatural
fortitude
of
manner
''
,
and
finally
kisses
it
to
Miss
Havisham
in
a
parody
of
the
lady's
own
mannerism
toward
Estella
.

We
first
see
him
shaking
Mrs.
Joe's
hand
on
discovering
the
sizable
amount
of
the
premium
paid
to
her
husband
for
Pip's
indenture
as
an
apprentice
and
later
pumping
Pip's
hands
``
for
the
hundredth
time
at
least
''
(
``
May
I
--
may
I
--
''
?
?

Pip
first
learns
``
the
stupendous
power
of
money
''
from
the
sycophantic
tailor
,
Mr.
Trabb
,
whose
brutality
to
his
boy
helper
exactly
matches
the
financial
resource
of
each
new
customer
,
and
whose
fawning
hands
touch
``
the
outside
of
each
elbow
''
and
``
rub
''
Pip
out
of
the
shop
.

Research
at
Fayette
,
Missouri
on
oxidation
ponds
has
shown
that
the
BOD
in
the
treated
effluent
varied
from
30
to
53
with
loadings
from
8
to
120
lb
.

Later
,
Eckenfelder
increased
the
efficiency
of
treatment
to
between
75
and
85
per
cent
in
the
summer
months
.

It
appeared
from
the
limited
information
available
that
the
aerated
lagoon
might
offer
a
satisfactory
means
of
increasing
the
capacity
of
existing
oxidation
ponds
as
well
as
providing
the
same
degree
of
treatment
in
a
smaller
volume
.

This
necessitated
the
construction
of
temporary
sewage
treatment
facilities
with
an
expected
life
from
5
to
15
Aj
.

The
oxidation
pond
has
a
surface
area
of
4.77
acres
and
a
depth
of
4
Aj
.

In
the
summer
of
1960
the
oxidation
pond
became
completely
septic
and
emitted
obnoxious
odors
.

The
lack
of
adequate
data
on
the
aerated
lagoon
system
prompted
the
developer
to
construct
an
aerated
lagoon
pilot
plant
to
determine
its
feasibility
for
treating
domestic
sewage
.

The
side
slopes
were
coated
with
fiberglas
matting
coated
with
asphalt
to
prevent
erosion
.

Initially
,
the
wastewater
would
be
entirely
from
the
shopping
center
with
the
domestic
sewage
from
the
houses
increasing
over
an
18-month
period
.

This
operation
would
permit
evaluation
of
the
pilot
plant
,
with
a
slowly
increasing
load
,
over
a
reasonable
period
of
time
.

The
pilot
plant
was
equipped
with
a
3-hp.
turbine
aerator
(
Figure
2
)
.

The
sewage
flow
into
the
treatment
plant
was
metered
and
continuously
recorded
on
24-hr.
charts
.

Weekly
samples
would
make
any
changes
more
readily
discernible
than
daily
samples
.

Pilot
plant
operations

The
BOD
of
the
raw
sewage
was
typical
of
domestic
sewage
from
a
subdivision
.

The
BOD
in
the
effluent
averaged
58
,
a
76-per-cent
reduction
over
the
24-hr.
period
.

The
organic
loading
on
the
unit
averaged
32
lb
of
or
about
2
lb
cu
ft
aeration
capacity
.

The
flow
rate
remained
relatively
constant
during
the
winter
months
as
shown
in
Table
1
.

At
no
time
were
algae
found
in
the
mixed
liquor
.

Initially
,
the
flagellated
protozoa
predominated
,
but
they
soon
gave
way
to
the
free
swimming
ciliated
protozoa
.

When
the
temperature
reached
32-degrees-F
all
protozoan
activity
ceased
;
;

The
maximum
rate
of
oxygen
transfer
at
1.0
dissolved
oxygen
was
calculated
as
220
at
a
maximum
rate
of
9.3
Aj
.

The
location
of
the
oxidation
pond
in
a
high-value
residential
area
makes
odor
nuisances
a
sensitive
problem
for
the
developer
.

The
daily
sewage
volume
to
the
oxidation
pond
averaged
147,000
gpd
,
giving
a
retention
period
of
42
days
.

Operational
intelligence
presumably
will
be
available
from
our
national
intelligence
agencies
;
;

Thinking
on
submarine
defense
has
not
always
been
clear-cut
.

Each
seems
to
strive
for
elimination
of
the
necessity
for
the
others
.

It
would
allow
presentation
to
the
public
of
a
unified
approach
.

A
unified
concept
can
serve
as
a
guide
to
budgeting
and
,
if
public
support
is
gained
,
will
command
Congressional
support
.

An
over-all
concept
will
guide
industry
where
available
talents
and
facilities
will
yield
greatest
dividends
.

Attack
can
come
from
almost
any
direction
against
many
locations
.

Initially
,
having
fewer
units
of
some
elements
--
especially
submarines
--
than
the
opponent
,
our
capabilities
need
to
be
sufficiently
greater
than
theirs
,
so
that
the
exchange
will
be
in
our
favor
.

Therefore
,
the
plan's
fifth
principle
must
be
that
it
capitalize
on
the
capabilities
of
all
elements
in
combination
.

Shipbuilding
,
aircraft
procurement
,
and
weapon
programs
indicate
that
there
will
not
be
enough
of
anything
.

The
seventh
principle
of
the
plan
is
self-evident
;
;

Consequently
,
the
system
giving
area
coverage
(
if
such
coverage
is
less
than
world
wide
)
must
be
flexible
and
hence
at
least
partially
mobile
.

Environmental
intelligence
is
just
as
important
.

Therefore
,
improved
intelligence
will
result
in
reduced
force
requirements
and
,
as
it
supports
all
other
elements
,
rates
a
top
priority
.

Gathering
intelligence
is
important
,
but
of
equal
importance
is
its
translation
into
usable
form
.

All
capabilities
must
be
used
to
maximum
advantage
then
.

There
may
be
others
.

A
concurrent
effort
is
needed
to
make
oceanographic
data
useful
on
the
spot
.

A
most
attractive
feature
is
that
detection
and
attack
are
combined
in
a
single
package
.

Systems
covering
the
Gulf
of
St.
Lawrence
and
possibly
the
entire
coasts
of
the
United
States
are
not
impossible
.

Such
mine
defense
systems
could
permit
concentration
of
mobile
forces
in
the
open
oceans
with
consequent
increase
in
the
probability
of
success
.

Systems
which
detect
submarines
over
wide
areas
are
attractive
,
although
they
can
be
only
``
burglar
alarms

Preparation
of

compound
is
often
accomplished
by
the
simple
method
of
reacting
a
metal
salt
with
a
ligand
in
a
suitable
solvent
such
as
an
alcohol
.

Recent
work
with
radiocarbon
and
deuterated
alcohols
as
solvents
,
however
,
has
given
evidence
that
metal-hydrido
and
carbonyl
complexes
may
be
readily
formed
by
reaction
with
alcohol
in
some
of
these
systems

and
constancy

and
length
have
been
interrelated

Limitations
on
the
lengths
of
these
sequences
diminish
the
stability
of
the
comparatively
short
crystallites
which
can
be
formed
,
and
this
is
reflected
in
a
broadening
of
the

An
early
hope
that
irradiation
might
be
the
ultimate
answer
to
practically
all
food
preservation
problems
was
soon
dispelled
.

Interest
remained
,
however
,
in
the
possibility
that
it
would
serve
as
a
useful
supplementary
method
for
counteracting
spoilage
losses
and
for
preserving
some
foods
at
lower
over-all
costs
than
freezing
,
or
without
employing
heat
or
chemicals
with
their
attendant
taste
alterations
.

Microorganisms
are
often
responsible
for
the
rapid
spoilage
of
foods
.

Enzymatic
action
in
stored
food
produces
changes
which
can
adversely
affect
the
appearance
of
food
or
its
palatability
.

Spoilage
by
chemical
action
results
from
the
reaction
of
one
group
of
components
in
the
food
with
others
or
with
its
environment
,
as
in
corrosion
of
the
walls
of
metal
containers
or
the
reaction
of
fats
with
oxygen
in
the
air
to
produce
rancidity
.

General
effects
of
ionizing
radiation

Because
of
undesirable
flavors
,
odors
,
colors
,
and
generally
low
palatability
associated
with
radiation
treatment
of
this
magnitude
,
the
inactivation
of
enzymes
is
best
accomplished
prior
to
irradiation
by
the
conventional
heat-processing
methods
of
blanching
.

For
radiosterilization
,
to
destroy
all
organisms
for
long-term
preservation
--
about
4.5
Mrad
for
nonacid
foods
of
low
salt
content
.

For
inhibiting
the
sprouting
of
root
vegetables
--
4,000
to
10,000
Aj
.

For
irradiation
of
food
,
the
results
obtained
depend
upon
the
dose
rather
than
the
specific
type
of
radiation
,
and
X-ray
,
gamma
,
and
high-energy
electron
radiation
are
suitable
.

Aside
from
availability
and
economic
considerations
,
each
has
certain
practical
advantages
;
;

Estimated
production
costs
of
radiation
energy
from
machine
and
nuclide
sources
range
from
$1
to
$10
per
Aj
.

It
has
been
estimated
that
for
applications
on
a
megawatt
scale
costs
might
reach
values
in
the
neighborhood
of
10
cents
per
kwhr
for
large-scale
accelerators
or
for
gamma
radiation
generated
in
a
reactor
core
.

Because
agricultural
activities
are
seasonal
and
the
areas
of
production
and
harvest
of
many
foods
are
widely
scattered
geographically
,
and
because
of
the
high
cost
of
transporting
bulk
food
items
any
substantial
distance
to
a
central
processing
location
,
the
use
of
large
central
processing
stations
,
where
low-cost
radiation
facilities
approaching
the
megawatt
range
might
be
utilized
,
is
inherently
impracticable
.

High
nutritional
value
,
variety
,
palatability
,
and
appetizing
appearance
are
important
for
reasons
of
morale
.

Of
primary
interest
are
meats
.

To
date
,
the
one
meat
showing
favorable
results
at
sterilization
doses
is
pork
.

The
preradiation
blanching
process
discolors
the
treated
beef
and
liquid
accumulates
in
prepackaged
cuts
.

A
refrigerated
item
could
also
be
heated
and
served
in
less
time
than
is
required
for
frozen
foods
of
the
same
type
.

The
table
on
page
10
shows
costs
of
canning
and
freezing
meat
,
and
estimated
costs
for
irradiation
under
certain
assumed
conditions
.

Acceptable
taste
and
odor
are
retained
by
the
irradiated
and
refrigerated
chicken
.

Acceptance
of
radiopasteurization
is
likely
to
be
delayed
,
however
,
for
two
reasons
:
(
1
)
the
storage
life
of
fresh
chicken
under
refrigeration
is
becoming
a
minimal
problem
because
of
constantly
improved
sanitation
and
distributing
practices
,
and
(
2
)
treatment
by
antibiotics
,
a
measure
already
approved
by
the
Federal
Food
and
Drug
Administration
,
serves
to
extend
the
storage
life
of
chicken
at
a
low
cost
of
about
0.5
cents
per
pound
.

The
measurement
of
topcoats
on
primers
can
also
readily
be
carried
out
.

It
can
be
seen
from
Fig.
2
that
the
cutting
removal
of
a
coating
from
its
substrate
involves
pure
cohesive
failure
of
the
coating
.

The
molecular
forces
holding
the
coating
to
the
substrate
are
obviously
greater
than
the
cohesive
strength
of
the
coating
and
failure
occurs
by
shear
along
a
plane
starting
at
the
tip
of
the
knife
and
extending
to
the
coating
surface
.

The
pictures
of
Figs.
3
and
4
show
the
cracking
and
peeling
types
of
removal
where
the
coating
is
detached
by
failure
in
a
region
at
,
or
close
to
,
the
interface
between
coating
and
substrate
.

If
the
force
required
to
remove
the
coatings
is
plotted
against
film
thickness
,
a
graph
as
illustrated
schematically
in
Fig.
5
may
characteristically
result
.

Here
,
H
is
the
coatings
removal
force
measured
parallel
to
the
surface
of
the
substrate
and
T
is
the
film
thickness
.

Why
should
the
``
practical
adhesion
''
of
a
coating
as
assessed
by
a
knife
method
change
,
initially
increasing
rather
rapidly
and
then
decreasing
stepwise
to
very
low
values
as
the
knife
is
forced
through
a
coating
of
increasing
thickness
?
?

The
cutting
(
or
shearing
)
removal
process
has
been
previously
described
.

It
was
found
that
the
coating
is
separated
from
its
substrate
entirely
by
cohesive
failure
.

The
action
and
reaction
forces
are
R
and
Af
,
respectively
,
and
are
equal
and
opposite
in
direction
.

Af
is
the
shear
force
along
the
shear
plane
;
;

Af
and
Af
are
the
thrust
forces
acting
against
coating
and
knife
,
respectively
;
;

An
analysis
of
the
vector
relationships
shows
that
the
rake
angle
**yc
and
the
friction
angle
**yt
determine
the
vector
direction
Af
of
the
force
resultants
R
and
Af
.

These
two
values
and
the
rake
angle
**yc
are
sufficient
to
determine
the
other
parameters
of
these
relationships
.

From
Fig.
6
the
relationship
between
these
parameters
can
readily
be
derived
and
the
cutting
force
is
Af
where
**yl
is
the
shear
strength
of
the
coating
and
is
a
parameter
of
the
coatings
material
,
W
is
the
width
of
the
removed
coating
and
T
is
its
thickness
.

However
,
in
the
actual
assessment
of
the
cutting
force
by
instrumental
methods
for
any
thickness
of
coating
a
number
of
spurious
effects
occur
which
must
be
taken
into
account
and
which
make
the
measured
value
larger
than
the
true
cutting
force
indicated
by
eqn.
(
1
)
.

In
extreme
cases
of
very
soft
knives
this
value
may
even
change
during
the
course
of
a
measurement
.

Under
equilibrium
conditions
of
cutting
the
chip
exerts
a
thrust
Af
against
the
knife
which
tends
to
push
it
into
the
substrate
or
lift
it
away
from
the
substrate
depending
on
the
vector
direction
of
Af
.

The
resultant
friction
force
,
Af
is
thus
directly
proportional
to
Af
and
consequently
also
to
film
thickness
.

Chipping
mechanism
of
cohesive
failure

Eventually
,
rupture
occurs
along
the
shear
plane
(
9e
)
,
and
the
cycle
repeats
itself
.

And
there
are
even
newer
foamed
plastics
that
are
yet
to
be
evaluated
.

It
might
be
well
to
point
out
,
however
,
some
of
the
newer
developments
that
have
taken
place
within
the
past
few
months
which
might
have
a
bearing
on
the
future
of
the
various
foamed
plastics
involved
.

Two
other
end-use
areas
which
contributed
to
expandable
styrene's
growth
during
the
year
were
packaging
(
molded
inserts
replacing
complicated
cardboard
units
)
and
foamed-core
building
panels
.

Urethane
foams

Since
the
mid
1950s
,
when
urethane
foam
first
made
its
appearance
in
the
American
market
,
growth
has
been
little
short
of
fantastic
.

foamed
refrigerator
insulation
is
under
intensive
evaluation
by
every
major
manufacturer
;
;

The
most
important
factor
in
determining
what
properties
the
end-product
will
have
is
quite
naturally
the
type
of
hydroxyl-rich
compound
that
is
used
in
its
production
.

It
is
possible
that
the
polyether
foams
may
soon
be
molded
on
a
production
basis
in
low-cost
molds
with
more
intricate
contours
and
with
superior
properties
to
latex
foam
.

By
varying
the
formula
,
this
curve
may
be
moved
forward
or
backward
along
the
coordinates
to
produce
any
desired
compression
strength
density
ratio
.

(
like
compression
strength
of
urethane
foams
,
it
has
a
direct
relationship
to
formulation
.

Figure
2
,
above
,
shows
the
aging
properties
of
urethane
foams
as
determined
by
the
percent
of
change
in
tensile
strength
during
exposure
to
ultra-violet
light
.

The
mixing
head
moves
back
and
forth
slowly
across
the
width
of
the
receptacle
.

Simple
systems
are
available
that
make
it
possible
for
urethane
foam
components
to
be
poured
,
pumped
,
etc.
,
into
a
void
where
they
foam
up
to
fill
the
void
.

The
top
rolls
are
loaded
with
40
lbs.
.

Sixty
lbs.
loading
is
possible
but
40
lbs.
is
adequate
.

The
160-ml.
bath
containing
the
calculated
amount
of
detergent
is
applied
slowly
and
directly
to
the
running
specimen
.

Washing
is
continued
for
30
minutes
or
for
a
period
of
time
sufficient
to
allow
100
nips
or
passes
through
the
squeeze
rolls
.

When
all
of
the
rinse
water
has
passed
from
the
reservoir
to
the
tubs
the
main
drains
are
lowered
to
permit
complete
draining
of
the
tubs
.

A
reflectance-measuring
instrument
may
be
desirable
to
measure
cleaning
,
whereas
Soxhlet
extraction
is
necessary
to
measure
grease
removal
.

The
person
using
these
tests
must
determine
which
combination
of
procedures
is
practical
for
any
specific
item
in
order
to
evaluate
the
dimensional
changes
of
textile
fabrics
or
garments
after
laundering
procedures
commonly
used
in
the
home
or
commercial
laundry
.

It
is
possible
to
identify
the
test
procedure
completely
with
a
code
consisting
of
a
Roman
Numeral
,
a
letter
,
and
an
Arabic
number

Theoretical

It
is
obvious
that
such
an
influence
can
only
be
expected
in
the
final
stage
of
an
image
intensifier
at
rather
high
output
levels
.

A
resolution
of
70
-
80
line-pairs
per
millimeter
appears
to
be
feasible
.

It
should
be
noted
that
photoluminescence
,
due
to
``

''
generated
within
the
viewing
screen
by
electron
impact
,
appears
to
be
important
only
if
anode
voltages
in
excess
of
30
KV
are
utilized
.

For
the
further
discussion
,
we
shall
thus
assume
an
electron
optical
resolution
of
80
Af
and
phosphor
screen
resolution
of

An
optimal
policy
is
one
which
in
some
sense
gets
the
best
out
of
the
process
as
a
whole
by
maximizing
the
value
of
the
product
.

The
specification
of
the
operating
variables
and
the
transformation
they
effect
;
;

For
a
chemical
process
the
first
of
these
might
involve
the
concentrations
of
the
different
chemical
species
,
and
the
temperature
or
pressure
of
the
stream
.

The
objective
function
,
which
is
to
be
maximized
,
is
some
function
,
usually
piecewise
continuous
,
of
the
product
state
.

When
it
is
necessary
to
be
specific
we
say
that
the
optimal
policy
is
an
optimal
R-stage
policy
with
respect
to
the
feed
state
Af
.

It
may
be
that
the
objective
function
depends
not
only
on
Af
but
also
on
Af
,
as
when
the
cost
of
the
operating
policy
is
considered
.

If
Af
denotes
the
net
profit
from
stage
R
and
Af
,
then
the
principle
of
optimality
gives
Af
.

If
we
consider
a
process
in
which
the
outcome
of
one
stage
is
known
before
passage
to
the
next
,
then
the
principle
of
optimality
shows
that
the
policy
in
subsequent
stages
should
be
optimal
with
respect
to
the
outcome
of
the
first
.

We
replace
r
,
the
number
of
the
stage
from
the
end
of
the
process
,
by
t
,
a
continuous
variable
which
measures
the
``
distance
''
of
the
point
considered
from
the
end
of
the
process
.

A
gyro-stabilized
platform
system
,
using
restrained
gyros
,
is
well
suited
for
automatic
leveling
because
of
the
characteristics
of
the
gyro-platform-servo
combination
.

The
gyro
angular
momentum
is
defined
by
H
.

In
the
system
shown
in
Fig.
7-1
,
the
accelerometer
output
is
amplified
and
the
resulting
voltage
is
applied
to
the
gyro
output-axis
torquer
.

This
torque
causes
the
entire
system
to
rotate
about
the
**yf
axis
,
since
the
response
to
Af
.

The
voltage
Af
is
amplified
by
Af
and
applied
to
the
gyro
torquer
with
scale
factor
Af
.

The
system
as
indicated
in
Fig.
7-2
is
fundamental
and
simple
because
the
transient
effects
of
both
the
platform
servo
and
the
accelerometer
have
been
neglected
.

In
addition
,
the
cutoff
frequency
for
input
accelerations
is
approximately
proportional
to
the
servo
loop
gain
;
;

This
problem
usually
determines
the
lower
limit
of
loop
gain
rather
than
response
time
.

It
must
be
noticed
in
Fig.
7-1
that
the
accelerometer
responds
to
any
input
acceleration
.

There
are
many
such
components
of
acceleration
present
due
to
the
effect
of
wind
gusts
,
engine
noise
,
turbulence
around
the
vehicle
,
etc.
.

One
of
the
greatest
problems
associated
with
automatic
leveling
is
establishing
a
true
level
in
the
presence
of
high-level
acceleration
noise
.

This
technique
causes
the
system
to
respond
only
to
low
frequency
acceleration
components
such
as
the
platform
tilt
.

7-3
.

The
automatic
leveling
system
described
in
this
section
is
readily
adaptable
to
a
gyro-stabilized
platform
consisting
of
three
integrating
gyros
.

The
system
requires
some
switching
of
flight
equipment
circuits
.

The
leveling
process
can
be
accomplished
manually
,
and
the
results
are
as
satisfactory
as
those
obtained
with
automatic
equipment
.

Manual
leveling
requires
an
appropriate
display
of
the
accelerometer
outputs
.

However
,
skill
is
required
on
the
part
of
an
operator
to
level
a
platform
to
any
degree
of
accuracy
.

External
determination
of
heading
--
surveying
technique
.

A
mirror
is
mounted
on
each
accelerometer
so
that
the
plane
of
the
mirror
is
perpendicular
to
the
sensitive
axis
of
the
unit
.

With
the
transit
set
up
,
a
mirror
on
one
of
the
accelerometers
is
sighted
and
the
platform
is
turned
until
it
is
aligned
.

The
images
can
easily
be
aligned
with
a
high
degree
of
accuracy
.

Information
is
also
available
from
this
autocollimator
system
to
set
the
drift
bias
for
the
Z-axis
gyro
.

If
the
Z
gyro
is
drifting
,
a
current
generated
by
the
autocollimator
is
delivered
to
the
gyro
torquer
to
cancel
the
drift
.

For
the
case
of
a
purely
inertial
autonavigator
consisting
of
three
restrained
gyros
,
a
coordinate
system
is
used
where
the
sensitive
axis
of
the
X
accelerometer
is
parallel
to
the
east-west
direction
at
the
base
point
,
and
the
Y
accelerometer
sensitive
axis
is
parallel
to
the
north-south
direction
at
the
base
point
.

In
Fig.
7-4
,
the
input
axis
of
the
three-axis
platform
is
shown
at
some
point
on
the
earth
.

Scotty
accepted
the
decision
with
indifference
and
did
not
enter
the
arguments
.

He
was
discharged
from
the
hospital
after
a
two-day
checkup
and
he
and
his
parents
had
what
Mr.
McKinley
described
as
a
``
celebration
lunch
''
at
the
cafeteria
on
the
campus
.

Rachel
was
polite
,
Scotty
indifferent
.

``
The
blueberry
pie
is
good
,
Scotty
.

Since
his
seizure
,
Scotty
had
had
little
appetite
;
;

His
face
was
fuller
;
;

Rachel
had
little
to
say
.

It
was
a
strained
,
silent
lunch
.

Thirty-four

He
rose
late
and
went
down
in
his
bathrobe
and
slippers
to
have
breakfast
either
alone
or
with
Rachel
.

She
would
hover
over
him
and
,
looking
like
her
brother
,
anxiously
watch
the
progress
of
Scotty's
fork
or
spoon
.

Virginia
and
Rachel
talked
to
each
other
quietly
now
,
as
allies
who
are
political
rather
than
natural
might
in
a
war
atmosphere
.

He
ate
what
he
felt
like
,
slept
as
much
or
as
little
as
he
pleased
,
and
moved
about
the
draughty
rooms
of
the
house
,
when
he
was
not
in
bed
,
with
slow
,
dubious
steps
,
like
an
elderly
tourist
in
a
cathedral
.

He
did
not
care
.

Scotty
said
,
``
That's
all
right
.

They
were
far
off
and
looked
tiny
.

The
doctor
had
to
bend
close
to
hear
;
;

Scotty
said
the
same
words
more
loudly
.

He
said
fussily
,
``
Just
keep
the
cap
on
those
strong
emotions
''
.

Rachel
stayed
on
after
the
doctor
had
gone
.

Scotty
watched
with
disinterest
.

She
wants
to
pay
you
a
visit
.

She
was
frowning
.

Scotty
said
,
``
I
don't
know
''
.

``
Well
,
there's
time
,
in
any
case
.

We'll
wait
till
you're
stronger
and
then
talk
about
it
''
.

Scotty
was
pleased
.

His
father
was
a
constant
visitor
.

``
How's
Scotty
''
?
?

He's
getting
plenty
of
rest
''
.

``
I'm
eating
more
''
,
he
would
say
.

Or
:
``
I
walk
around
the
house
a
lot
''
.

``
Perhaps
you
should
get
out
a
little
''
.

He
did
not
mind
the
useless
,
kindly
questions
.

He
looked
at
the
lined
face
with
vague
interest
;
;

If
he
were
to
go
with
White
,
he
would
be
out
there
two
days
,
not
just
listening
in
the
dark
at
some
point
between
here
and
Papa-san
,
but
moving
ever
deeper
into
enemy
land
--
behind
Papa-san
--
itself
.

Was
this
what
he
had
expected
?
?

Now
he
knew
that
the
moment
illuminated
by
the
vision
on
the
train
would
have
to
be
approached
.

White's
suggestion
flattered
,
but
he
did
not
like
the
identity
.

He
did
not
spill
over
with
hatred
for
the
enemy
.

Pressing
his
cigarette
out
in
the
earth
,
Warren
walked
to
the
slit
and
scanned
the
jagged
hills
.

Others
carried
extra
clips
for
the
Browning
Automatic
Rifle
,
which
was
in
the
hands
of
a
little
Mexican
named
Martinez
.

Remember
what
I
said
about
going
out
to
get
anybody
left
behind
?
?

That
still
holds
.

We
bring
back
all
dead
and
wounded
''
.

At
2130
hours
they
had
passed
through
the
barbed
wire
at
the
point
of
departure
.

They
set
bouncing
betties
to
jump
and
explode
at
testicle
level
while
we
more
mercifully
had
them
go
off
at
the
head
.

Because
they
were
new
men
and
to
be
sure
that
they
didn't
get
lost
,
Prevot
had
placed
Warren
and
White
in
the
center
of
the
patrol
as
it
filed
out
.

He
could
also
hear
the
stream
which
he
had
seen
from
his
position
.

On
their
right
rose
the
embankment
covered
with
brush
and
trees
.

Thus
,
stealthily
they
advanced
upstream
;
;

The
shapes
of
the
men
ahead
of
him
lacked
solidity
,
as
if
the
whip
had
stripped
them
of
their
very
flesh
.

Looming
over
all
,
Papa-san
leered
down
at
him
,
threatening
a
hundred
hidden
malevolencies
.

Somewhere
over
there
another
patrol
had
need
of
light
.

From
the
east
to
the
west
coast
of
the
Korean
peninsula
was
a
strip
of
land
in
which
fear-filled
men
were
at
that
same
moment
furtively
crawling
through
the
night
,
sitting
in
sweaty
anticipation
of
any
movement
or
sound
,
or
shouting
amidst
confused
rifle
flashes
and
muzzle
blasts
.

Even
at
this
short
distance
they
were
only
vague
shapes
,
setting
up
the
machine
gun
on
a
small
knoll
so
that
it
could
fire
above
the
heads
of
the
rest
of
the
patrol
.

Figures
seemed
to
crouch
in
the
surrounding
dark
;
;

Above
,
the
glowing
ivory
baton
of
their
searchlight
pointed
at
the
clouds
,
diluting
the
valley's
dark
to
a
pallid
light
.

Pierre
had
no
hands
;
;

they
had
been
severed
at
the
wrists
.

``
Mais
,
oui
.

``
Doesn't
it
ever
bother
you
''
,
Warren
had
asked
,
``
to
have
people
always
asking
you
about
your
hands
''
?
?

``
Oh
,
the
French
are
a
very
curious
people
''
,
Pierre
had
laughed
.

I'm
used
to
all
three
,
but
I
think
the
French
have
the
healthiest
attitude
''
.

Within
two
weeks
Warren
was
ringing
the
bell
at
the
abbey
gate
.

Smiling
at
Warren's
protestations
,
the
old
monk
took
his
grip
from
him
and
led
him
down
a
corridor
to
a
small
parlor
.

The
nude
was
small
and
black-haired
and
elfin
,
and
was
called
``
Eloise
''
.

This
was
one
place
where
Moonan
could
go
for
a
drink
in
a
back
booth
without
anyone
noticing
him
,
or
at
least
coming
up
and
hanging
around
and
wanting
to
know
all
the
low-down
.

The
other
patrons
were
taxi
drivers
and
art
students
and
small
shopkeepers
.

The
reporters
had
not
yet
discovered
that
this
was
his
hideaway
.

His
friend
Jane
was
with
him
.

A
romantic
is
one
who
thinks
the
world
is
divinely
inspired
and
all
he
has
to
do
is
find
the
right
key
,
and
then
divine
justice
and
altruism
will
appear
.

That's
to
say
,
he
was
trigger
happy
.

He'd
shoot
at
anything
if
it
was
the
rear
end
of
a
horse
or
his
own
sentry
.

He
was
a
wiry
,
inscrutable
,
silent
country
boy
from
the
red
clay
of
rural
Alabama
,
and
he
spoke
with
the
broad
drawl
that
others
normally
make
fun
of
.

They
caught
Trig
stealing
liquor
from
the
officers'
mess
,
and
he
got
a
couple
of
girls
in
trouble
.

There
was
a
lot
of
shooting
.

Trig
and
a
very
black
colored
boy
from
Detroit
had
killed
or
put
out
of
action
ten
guerrillas
by
grenades
and
hand-to-hand
fighting
.

When
we
got
there
,
Trig
and
the
Negro
were
quarreling
over
possession
of
a
gold
crucifix
around
the
neck
of
a
wounded
Filipino
.

``
What
did
the
Colonel
do
about
the
men
''
?
?

Jefferson
Lawrence
was
alone
at
the
small
,
perfectly
appointed
table
by
the
window
looking
out
over
the
river
.

He
thought
how
this
dainty
,
fragile
older
woman
threading
her
way
through
the
streets
of
Westminster
on
a
day
in
June
,
enjoying
the
flowers
in
the
shops
,
the
greetings
from
old
friends
,
but
never
really
drawing
a
deep
,
passionate
breath
,
was
so
like
himself
.

No
,
they
must
look
the
other
way
and
climb
one
more
painful
step
up
the
ladder
.

He
made
the
decision
with
his
eyes
open
,
or
so
he
thought
.

He
was
not
stone
.

He
had
to
teach
himself
patiently
that
these
traps
were
not
for
him
.

Like
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
with
her
regrets
about
Peter
Walsh
,
he
had
his
moments
of
melancholy
over
a
youth
too
well
spent
.

But
then
his
son
could
afford
it
.

The
Vice
President
had
called
and
asked
if
he
could
see
the
Secretary
at
his
home
.

Human
nature
was
not
a
piece
of
meat
you
could
tell
was
bad
by
its
smell
.

This
young
man
had
so
little
time
to
learn
he
had
to
be
curious
;
;

he
had
to
find
out
.

The
Secretary
did
not
tell
him
at
what
cost
,
at
what
loneliness
,
he
learned
these
things
.

Again
,
Lawrence
thought
a
little
sadly
,
these
were
the
fees
of
poverty
and
ambition
.

Where
will
you
break
?
?

Old
Chris
is
my
ideal
.

Let
me
tell
you
what
happened
to
me
today
.

A
fellow
came
up
to
me
,
a
Senator
,
I
don't
have
to
tell
you
his
name
,
and
he
told
me
,
'
I
love
the
President
like
a
brother
,
but
God
damn
it
,
he's
crucifying
me
.

Literally
,
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
.

Annisberg
was
about
seventy-five
miles
west
of
Birmingham
,
near
the
Georgia
border
and
on
the
Tallahoosa
River
,
a
small
and
dirty
stream
.

It
was
an
old
and
dirty
wooden
structure
,
sadly
in
need
of
repair
.

For
the
old
preacher
who
had
been
there
twenty-five
years
was
dead
,
and
the
city
mourned
him
.

It
began
invariably
in
low
tones
,
almost
conversational
,
and
then
gradually
worked
up
to
high
,
shrill
appeals
to
God
and
man
.

He
had
no
chance
to
say
another
word
.

First
of
all
there
was
the
parsonage
,
an
utterly
impossible
place
for
civilized
people
to
live
in
,
originally
poorly
conceived
,
apparently
not
repaired
for
years
,
with
no
plumbing
or
sewage
,
with
rat-holes
and
rot
.

The
teacher
was
a
pliant
fool
.

Undoubtedly
,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
gambling
in
both
.

On
the
other
side
of
the
church
was
a
quiet
,
well-kept
house
with
shutters
and
recently
painted
.

But
nevertheless
it
looked
respectable
.

He
was
glad
to
have
it
there
.

Dives
,
carefully
repaired
huts
,
and
nicely
painted
and
ornamented
cottages
were
jumbled
together
cheek
by
jowl
with
little
distinction
.

The
best
could
not
escape
from
the
worst
and
the
worst
nestled
cosily
beside
the
better
.

Behind
were
privies
,
for
there
was
no
sewage
system
.

He
talked
about
it
to
the
Presiding
Elder
.

He
was
not
sure
what
kind
of
a
man
he
had
in
hand
.

It
was
hardly
possible
to
get
any
argument
on
the
subject
.

Tenements
,
stores
,
saloons
,
some
gambling
,
I
hope
not
too
much
.

Wilson
stared
at
her
.

``
Talk
to
Mrs.
Catt
''
,
she
said
.

Good
wages
,
patronage
and
subscription
of
various
kinds
stopped
open
protest
from
Negroes
.

And
for
him
to
leave
this
job
now
without
accomplishing
anything
would
mean
practically
the
end
of
his
career
in
the
Methodist
church
,
if
not
in
all
churches
.

Secretary
of
State
Seward
was
a
sick
man
.

If
their
schedules
were
to
synchronize
,
there
was
no
point
in
wasting
time
.

This
was
the
largest
house
he
had
ever
been
in
,
almost
the
largest
building
,
except
for
a
hotel
.

He
had
no
idea
where
Seward's
room
would
be
.

Still
,
the
sensation
always
surprised
him
.

The
sound
of
his
footsteps
was
like
a
muffled
drum
.

At
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
ran
into
somebody
standing
there
angrily
in
a
dressing
gown
.

He
smiled
,
but
now
that
he
knew
where
the
elder
Seward
was
,
he
did
not
intend
to
go
.

He
got
caught
up
into
it
and
became
a
different
person
.

Two
men
pulled
him
off
.

Payne
hacked
at
their
arms
.

There
was
a
lady
there
,
in
a
nightdress
.

The
clammy
air
revived
him
.

Herold
,
he
saw
,
had
fled
.

The
nigger
boy
was
close
behind
him
.

He
had
no
idea
where
he
was
.

He
felt
curiously
sleepy
,
the
world
seemed
far
away
;
;

As
Sir
Giles
Overreach
(
how
often
had
he
had
to
play
that
part
,
who
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
)
,
he
raised
his
arm
and
declaimed
:
``
Where
is
my
honour
now
''
?
?

The
audience
,
as
usual
,
loved
it
.

Wilkes
was
quite
right
about
one
thing
.

Laura
Keene
had
been
in
the
green
room
.

It
was
not
so
much
that
the
shot
had
stunned
the
audience
,
as
that
they
had
been
stunned
already
.

At
the
end
of
the
monologue
the
audience
would
applaud
.

Meanwhile
it
looked
at
the
scenery
.

Booth
had
delivered
his
line
.

They
strained
forward
.

Yet
this
scream
had
a
different
note
in
it
.

On
the
stage
,
Harry
Hawk
began
to
weep
.

Laura
Keene
brushed
by
him
with
the
glass
of
water
.

It
was
not
exactly
panic
they
gave
way
to
,
but
they
could
not
just
sit
there
.

At
the
rear
of
the
auditorium
,
upstairs
,
some
men
tried
to
push
open
the
door
to
the
box
corridor
.

By
the
look
of
him
he
wasn't
that
far
gone
.

Katie
reared
a
third
time
,
then
,
trembling
,
descended
.

Seizing
the
bridle
,
he
tugged
with
all
his
might
and
forced
Katie
to
her
knees
.

Instantly
,
he
chilled
.

His
head
hung
over
the
boards
of
Katie's
stall
;
;

before
it
was
sprawled
the
mangled
corpse
of
the
bearded
stranger
.

``
Po'
Chavis
''
!
!

The
trainman
called
.

The
wood
was
old
,
the
paint
alligatored
.

The
clock
which
had
struck
presented
an
innocent
face
.

In
the
kitchen
Mama
was
wiping
the
cupboards
.

``
There's
a
tower
and
a
steeple
on
the
church
a
million
feet
high
.

He
crossed
Broome
Street
to
Orange
Square
.

The
Catholics
had
the
largest
cemetery
,
near
the
Neversink
River
where
Main
Street
ran
south
;
;

He
was
fortunate
,
and
proud
.

The
veterans
,
idling
on
their
benches
in
the
Square
,
beneath
the
soldiers'
monument
,
got
to
their
feet
when
Papa
approached
:
``
Morning
,
Reverend
''
!
!

``
He'll
make
a
preacher
out
of
you
''
!
!

``
Somebody's
got
to
be
a
preacher
in
the
family
.

He
made
a
will
and
last
testament
before
we
left
Paterson
.

``
Everybody
does
''
.

Ludie
could
be
hateful
.

To
speak
of
Papa
dying
was
a
sin
.

When
Papa's
slender
fingers
removed
the
spectacles
,
there
were
red
indentations
on
the
bridge
of
the
strong
nose
.

Perhaps
one
day
He
will
choose
you
as
He
chose
me
,
long
ago
.

Therefore
,
give
Him
your
affection
and
store
up
His
love
for
you
.

For
His
mercy
and
His
guidance
to
spare
you
from
evil
and
eternal
punishment
in
the
Lake
of
Fire
''
.

He
would
hear
the
Call
and
would
run
to
tell
Papa
.

He
must
not
fail
to
hear
it
.

he
dared
to
wait
for
the
lightning
.

Thunder
crashed
;
;

Violet
whinnied
from
the
stable
.

Drenched
and
shaking
,
he
stood
near
the
sweet-smelling
stall
and
dared
to
pat
her
muzzle
.

He
jumped
.

He
,
too
,
cocked
his
cap
at
a
jaunty
angle
,
jingled
marbles
in
his
pocket
,
and
swaggered
down
Main
Street
.

He
wondered
whether
God
had
a
dog
in
the
sky
.

A
tall
lady
,
with
a
ruffled
collar
very
low
on
her
bosom
,
turned
insolent
green
eyes
upon
him
.

She
was
taller
than
Aggie
.

She
was
so
beautiful
with
her
rosy
mouth
and
haughty
air
that
she
had
to
be
wicked
.

He
chuckled
,
the
memory
vivid
.

Sonuvabitch
,
I
can't
figure
out
what
in
hell
for
they
went
and
put
niggers
in
my
squad
for
.

He
ain't
so
bad
.

Look
at
thum
.

``
I
told
him
''
,
he
said
aloud
They'll
get
the
guys
that
done
it
.

Keerist
.

A
tune
began
to
whirl
inside
his
head
.

One
of
his
favorites
:
``
Guitar
Boogie
''
.

Turn
the
bastards
over
to
me
--
to
me
and
my
boys
--
no
nigger
ever
got
what
would
be
comin
to
them
--
reactionary
bastards
.

The
word
also
made
him
feel
hate
,
sincere
hate
,
for
those
so
labeled
.

Not
captured
,
sent
here
.

To
fuck
up
the
program
.

One
day
,
Ching
had
told
him
(
smiling
,
patting
him
on
the
back
)
as
they
walked
to
the
weekly
conference
of
squad
leaders
,
``
Keep
it
up
,
your
squad
is
good
,
one
of
the
best
,
keep
it
up
,
keep
up
the
good
work
''
.

He
felt
intense
satisfaction
.

The
thought
came
back
,
the
one
nagging
at
him
these
past
four
days
.

He
tried
to
stifle
it
.

the
final
word
came
forth
.

He
felt
good
.

Jesus
,
the
guy
says
he
is
trying
.

No
one
is
stupid
.

That's
what
he
said
.

It
is
plain
as
hell
Johnson
is
no
reactionary
.

So
you're
not
tryin
,
Johnson
,
you
bastard
you
.

He
looked
over
at
him
,
lying
there
,
asleep
,
and
he
felt
a
wave
of
revulsion
.

Why
didn't
the
damn
Reactionaries
bump
him
off
?
?

Who
is
the
man
to
take
His
place
?
?

The
guy
with
most
on
the
Ball
.

Knows
the
score
With
a
supreme
effort
,
he
broke
it
off
.

The
whole
fucken
sky's
cavin
in
!
!

Keeeerist
!
!

Lookit
it
!
!

Cover
the
whole
building
,
bury
us
all
,
by
nightfall
.

Somebody
,
got
to
be
somebody
If
I
don't
put
my
two
cents
in
soon
,
somebody
else
will
I
know
they're
waitin
only
for
one
thing
:
for
the
bastards
what
done
it
to
be
nailed
.

Maybe
they
already
got
them
.

He
was
again
tingling
with
pleasure
,
seeing
himself
clearly
in
Slater's
shoes
.

Top
dog
,
sleeping
and
eating
right
there
with
the
Staff
.

Ching
,
Tien
,
all
of
them
.

Top
dog
.

It
was
nothing
,
though
his
heart
was
thumping
wildly
.

``
Yehhh
''
,
said
Coughlin
,
practically
spitting
on
him
.

All
he
does
is
to
bullshit
with
his
squad
,
and
they
are
the
stupidest
bastards
around
.

All
those
dumb
8-Balls
croaked
.

Give
um
the
works
.

Finnegan
woke
up
.

There
was
a
hell
of
a
noise
this
time
of
morning
.

For
Christ's
sake
!
!

``
How
long
did
you
study
?
?

I
thought
I
knew
.

Why
don't
Uncle
Sam
mind
his
own
fucken
business
?
?

Goddammit
.

Why
should
I
be
spinning
just
because
the
goddamn
log
is
spinning
?
?

But
Voltaire
perseveres
.

He
asks
.

When
finally
the
two
bedraggled
men
reach
their
friend's
home
,
Voltaire's
fears
are
once
again
aroused
.

He
is
in
a
hurry
to
write
another
essay
against
culture
.

How
could
the
rich
,
for
whom
life
was
made
so
simple
,
ever
understand
the
subterfuges
,
the
lies
,
the
frauds
,
the
errors
,
sins
and
even
crimes
to
which
the
poor
were
driven
in
their
efforts
to
overcome
the
great
advantages
the
rich
had
in
the
race
of
life
?
?

How
,
for
example
,
could
a
Voltaire
understand
the
strange
predicament
in
which
a
Rousseau
would
find
himself
when
,
soon
after
the
furor
of
his
first
Discourse
,
he
acquired
still
another
title
to
fame
?
?

This
time
as
a
musician
.

``
Put
a
few
such
songs
together
''
,
they
urged
him
.

He
didn't
believe
them
.

``
This
is
the
sort
of
stuff
I
write
and
then
throw
away
''
!
!

``
You
must
make
an
opera
out
of
this
material
''
.

Well
,
yes
,
perhaps
in
literature
,
since
you
could
argue
that
you
couldn't
keep
silent
about
your
feelings
against
literature
and
so
were
involved
in
spite
of
yourself
.

For
it
was
Rameau's
type
of
music
that
he
had
been
trying
to
write
,
and
that
he
couldn't
write
.

But
no
.

That
glory
,
craved
for
so
long
,
was
now
forbidden
to
him
.

Rousseau
was
aware
that
he
must
seem
like
a
hypocrite
,
standing
there
and
arguing
that
he
could
not
possibly
permit
a
public
performance
.

Every
woman
has
had
the
experience
of
saying
no
when
she
meant
yes
,
and
saying
yes
when
she
meant
no
.

But
Duclos
thought
he
saw
a
way
out
.

``
Your
name
will
never
appear
.

All
these
emotions
were
screwed
up
to
new
heights
when
,
after
acceptance
and
the
first
rehearsals
,
there
ensued
such
a
buzz
of
excitement
among
Parisian
music
lovers
that
Duclos
had
to
come
running
to
Rousseau
to
inform
him
that
the
news
had
reached
the
superintendent
of
the
King's
amusements
,
and
that
he
was
now
demanding
that
the
work
be
offered
first
at
the
royal
summer
palace
of
Fontainebleau
.

``
What
was
your
answer
''
?
?

Why
had
not
this
success
come
to
him
before
he
had
plunged
into
his
Discourse
,
and
before
he
had
committed
himself
to
a
life
of
austerity
and
denial
?
?

--
he
had
to
play
a
role
of
self-effacement
.

How
titillating
it
was
to
go
among
people
who
did
not
know
him
as
the
composer
,
but
who
talked
in
the
most
glowing
terms
of
the
promise
of
the
piece
after
having
heard
the
first
rehearsals
.

And
listening
to
such
a
conversation
one
morning
while
taking
a
cup
of
chocolate
in
a
cafe
,
Rousseau
found
himself
bathed
in
perspiration
,
trembling
lest
his
authorship
become
known
,
and
at
the
same
time
dreaming
of
the
startling
effect
he
would
make
if
he
should
proclaim
himself
suddenly
as
the
composer
.

``
You
can't
go
in
that
way
''
!
!

``
At
home
,
yes
''
,
they
argued
.

Since
I
am
the
composer
''
!
!

Surely
it
would
grow
there
whether
I
washed
myself
or
not
.

A
hundred
years
ago
I
would
have
worn
a
beard
with
pride
.

And
those
without
beards
would
have
stood
out
as
not
dressed
for
the
occasion
.

That's
the
fashion
.

Not
Louis
15
,
,
since
even
he
obeys
.

But
of
course
behind
his
boldness
he
didn't
feel
bold
at
all
.

He
trembled
lest
his
piece
should
fail
.

I
have
observed
that
being
up
on
a
horse
changes
the
whole
character
of
a
man
,
and
when
a
very
small
man
is
up
on
a
saddle
,
he'd
like
as
not
prefer
to
eat
his
meals
there
.

I
have
heard
people
talk
with
contempt
about
the
British
regulars
,
but
that
only
proves
that
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
things
of
which
they
are
deplorably
ignorant
.

The
gun
would
fire
or
not
,
just
as
chance
willed
.

The
gunfire
,
which
was
so
near
that
it
seemed
just
a
piece
up
the
road
now
,
stopped
for
long
enough
to
count
to
twenty
;
;

I
don't
know
whether
he
was
after
our
rider
,
who
had
gone
by
a
minute
before
,
or
whether
he
was
simply
scouting
conditions
;
;

Half
crazed
by
the
weight
dragging
,
the
dust
,
and
the
heat
,
the
horse
leaped
our
wall
,
dashing
out
the
rider's
brains
against
it
,
and
leaving
him
lying
there
among
us
--
while
the
horse
crashed
away
through
the
brush
.

And
now
the
redcoats
were
coming
,
and
the
gunfire
was
a
part
of
the
dust
cloud
on
the
road
to
the
west
of
us
.

the
passage
and
rhythm
of
time
changed
,
and
when
I
remember
back
to
what
happened
then
,
each
event
is
a
separate
and
frozen
incident
.

A
voice
called
,
and
what
made
it
even
more
terrible
and
unreal
was
that
the
redcoat
ranks
never
paused
for
an
instant
,
only
some
of
them
glancing
toward
the
stone
wall
,
from
behind
which
the
voice
came
.

One
moment
there
was
a
man
in
the
saddle
;
;

the
next
a
headless
horror
on
a
horse
that
bolted
through
the
redcoat
ranks
,
and
during
the
next
second
or
two
,
we
all
of
us
fired
into
the
suddenly
disorganized
column
of
soldiers
.

In
the
course
of
this
,
they
had
fired
on
us
;
;

and
then
I
was
adding
my
own
voice
to
the
crescendo
of
sound
,
hurling
more
vile
language
than
I
ever
thought
I
knew
,
sobbing
and
shouting
,
and
aware
that
if
I
had
passed
water
before
,
it
was
not
enough
,
for
my
pants
were
soaking
wet
.

I
would
have
stood
there
and
died
there
if
left
to
myself
,
but
Cousin
Simmons
grabbed
my
arm
in
his
viselike
grip
and
fairly
plucked
me
out
of
there
;
;

We
tumbled
to
a
stop
in
Deacon
Gordon's
cow
hole
,
a
low-lying
bit
of
pasture
with
a
muddy
pool
of
water
in
its
middle
.

and
about
a
mile
to
the
west
a
cluster
of
at
least
fifty
Militia
were
making
their
way
in
our
direction
.

Cousin
Joshua
and
some
others
felt
that
we
should
march
toward
Lexington
and
take
up
new
positions
ahead
of
the
slow-moving
British
column
,
but
another
group
maintained
that
we
should
stick
to
this
spot
and
this
section
of
road
.

While
this
was
being
discussed
,
we
saw
the
militia
to
the
west
of
us
fanning
out
and
breaking
into
little
clusters
of
two
and
three
men
as
they
approached
the
road
.

If
we
cluster
together
,
the
redcoats
can
make
an
advantage
out
of
it
,
but
there's
not
a
blessed
thing
they
can
do
with
two
or
three
of
us
except
chase
us
,
and
we
can
outrun
them
''
.

They
tried
to
outface
him
,
but
Joseph
Simmons
was
as
wide
as
two
average
men
,
and
it
would
have
taken
braver
men
than
these
were
to
outface
him
.

But
the
thought
occurred
that
God
would
want
this
opportunity
used
to
tell
them
about
Him
.

I
say
to
you
that
the
Church
will
ever
decry
evil
''
!
!

Ablard
Corne
,
a
short
man
with
a
rotunda
of
stomach
,
rose
.

Before
them
stalked
the
beadle
,
proclaiming
as
he
went
,
``
Thus
the
Council
deals
with
those
who
break
its
laws
--
adulterers
,
thieves
,
murderers
,
and
lewd
persons
.

A
carriage
crunched
by
,
its
dim
lights
filtering
through
the
gloom
.

As
he
neared
the
square
,
a
round
figure
muffled
in
a
long
,
black
cape
whisked
by
.

Quickening
his
steps
,
John
entered
the
vast
church
and
climbed
the
tower
steps
to
the
bells
.

Below
the
moon-splashed
world
rolled
away
to
insurmountable
white
peaks
;
;

An
occasional
traveler
from
Italy
brought
news
of
Peter
Robert
,
who
was
now
distributing
his
Bible
among
the
Waldensian
peasants
.

John
found
it
difficult
,
but
he
held
him
in
check
.

And
Anthony
was
busy
most
of
the
time
courting
this
girl
and
that
.

Dice
rolled
,
prostitutes
plied
their
trade
,
thieves
stole
,
murderers
stabbed
,
and
the
ungodly
blasphemed
.

Catholics
who
were
truly
Christians
longed
for
the
simple
penance
of
days
gone
by
.

And
John's
reply
was
always
the
same
:
``
Anything
that
affects
souls
is
the
concern
of
the
Church
!
!

Monsieur
Favre's
threat
would
become
a
reality
,
for
he
continued
to
proclaim
loudly
that
the
city
must
rid
itself
of
``
that
Frenchman
''
.

The
slow
tapping
of
a
cane
on
the
stone
steps
coming
up
to
the
tower
interrupted
his
reverie
.

John
stood
above
him
,
his
face
ashen
.

``
Monsieur
Favre
just
paid
me
a
visit
.

It
is
to
be
a
trap
.

He
asked
to
be
appointed
a
preacher
.

But
Michael
Sept
had
unmasked
him
,
revealing
he
had
never
been
a
bishop
,
but
was
an
Anabaptist
,
afraid
to
state
his
faith
,
because
he
knew
John
Calvin
had
written
a
book
against
their
belief
that
the
soul
slept
after
death
.

The
firelight
played
over
Eli's
flowing
white
locks
and
rugged
features
.

On
the
outskirts
of
the
rabble
the
Camaret
brothers
and
Gaspard
Favre
shook
their
fists
.

``
Heretic
''
!
!

When
he
felt
the
side
of
his
head
,
his
fingers
came
away
covered
with
blood
.

Adam
watched
his
own
hands
make
the
caressing
,
anxious
movement
that
,
when
rain
falls
and
nobody
comes
,
and
ruin
draws
close
like
a
cat
rubbing
against
the
ankles
,
has
been
the
ritual
of
stall
vendors
,
forever
.

He
had
seen
a
dry
,
old
,
yellowing
hand
reach
out
,
with
that
painful
solicitude
,
to
touch
,
to
rearrange
,
to
shift
aimlessly
,
some
object
worth
a
pfennig
.

Then
why
was
he
assuming
the
role
--
the
gesture
and
the
suffering
?
?

He
looked
out
of
the
tent
at
the
company
street
.

The
rain
dripped
on
the
freezing
loblolly
of
the
street
.

In
this
heavy
air
,
however
,
that
device
did
not
seem
to
help
.

Once
covertly
looking
at
Simms
Purdew
,
the
only
man
in
the
world
whom
he
hated
,
he
had
seen
the
heavy
,
slack
,
bestubbled
jaw
open
and
close
to
emit
the
cruel
,
obscene
banter
,
and
had
seen
the
pale-blue
eyes
go
watery
with
whisky
and
merriment
,
and
suddenly
he
was
not
seeing
the
face
of
that
vile
creature
.

He
thought
that
if
once
,
only
once
,
he
could
talk
with
Simms
Purdew
,
something
about
his
own
life
,
and
all
life
,
would
be
clear
and
simple
.

It
gave
the
rubberized
fabric
a
dull
gleam
,
like
metal
.

The
head
was
wrapped
in
a
turban
and
on
top
of
the
turban
rode
a
great
hamper
across
which
a
piece
of
poncho
had
been
flung
.

The
gray
face
stared
straight
ahead
in
the
drizzle
.

Moisture
ran
down
the
cheeks
,
gathered
at
the
tip
of
the
nose
,
and
at
the
chin
.

The
figure
was
close
enough
now
for
him
to
see
the
nose
twitching
to
dislodge
the
drop
clinging
there
.

The
figure
stopped
and
one
hand
was
perilously
freed
from
the
hamper
to
scratch
the
nose
.

Then
the
figure
moved
on
.

``
Slice
o'
mutton
''
?
?

Her
name
was
Mollie
.

They
called
her
Mollie
the
Mutton
,
and
laughed
.

Mollie
the
Mutton
was
scratching
her
nose
.

What
had
that
man
,
that
other
young
Jew
,
felt
as
he
stood
in
the
twilight
and
heard
other
men
,
far
away
,
singing
together
?
?

He
thought
of
Simms
Purdew
snoring
on
his
bunk
while
Pullen
James
crouched
by
the
hearth
,
skirmishing
an
undershirt
for
lice
,
and
a
wet
log
sizzled
.

He
thought
of
Simms
Purdew
,
who
once
had
risen
at
the
edge
of
a
cornfield
,
a
maniacal
scream
on
his
lips
,
and
swung
a
clubbed
musket
like
a
flail
to
beat
down
the
swirl
of
Rebel
bayonets
about
him
.

He
thought
of
Simms
Purdew
rising
up
,
fearless
in
glory
.

He
felt
the
sweetness
of
pity
flood
through
him
,
veining
his
very
flesh
.

He
is
going
to
let
History
take
the
blame
for
a
while
''
.

He
thought
of
the
old
man
laughing
under
the
glitter
of
the
great
chandelier
.

``
Gonna
give
Ole
Buckra
all
his
money
''
?
?

Adam
nodded
.

Adam
looked
at
the
pot
.

A
chicken
with
six
tits
and
a
tail
lak
a
corkscrew
.

Mose
giggled
.

It
is
the
same
ole
same
,
tell
me
its
name
.

That
po'k
,
it
was
so
full
of
skippers
it
would
jump
and
run
and
not
come
when
you
say
,
hoo-pig
.

She
admired
him
.

He
seemed
to
be
muttering
,
his
voice
surprisingly
clear
.

``
'nother
minute
I'd
have
been
fine
.

``
Yes
,
I
know
,
Fritzie
.

The
night
before
,
they
had
telephoned
the
Andrus
maid
,
Selena
Masters
,
and
she
had
arrived
early
,
bursting
her
vigorous
presence
into
the
silent
house
with
an
assurance
that
amused
McFeeley
and
confounded
Moll
.

Selena
was
the
wrong
woman
for
these
crudities
.

Sergeant
Moll
understood
.

The
maid
was
very
black
and
very
energetic
,
trim
in
a
yellow
pique
uniform
.

``
Maybe
today'll
be
a
good-news
day
''
.

Moll
took
his
coffee
into
the
nursery
.

During
the
night
,
a
phone
company
technician
had
deadened
the
bells
and
installed
red
blinkers
on
the
phones
.

Andrus
did
not
answer
him
.

The
woman
had
the
glassy
look
of
an
invalid
,
as
if
she
had
not
slept
at
all
.

Did
anything
happen
during
the
night
''
?
?

The
previous
night's
horror
--
the
absolute
failure
,
overcast
with
the
intrusions
of
the
press
,
had
left
them
all
with
a
wan
sense
of
uselessness
,
of
play-acting
.

Kidnaper
spurns
ransom
;
;

The
bulk
of
the
press
corps
was
covering
Rheinholdt's
conference
.

He
did
not
see
Sparling
,
or
DeGroot
,
or
Ringel
,
or
any
of
the
feverish
crew
that
had
so
harassed
him
twelve
hours
ago
.

The
street
cleaner
had
not
yet
been
around
.

One
of
the
reporters
called
to
him
:
``
Anything
new
,
Lieutenant
''
?
?

They
offered
no
opinions
,
volunteered
nothing
,
betrayed
no
emotions
.

The
Skopas
people
seemed
to
him
of
that
breed
of
human
beings
whose
insularity
frees
them
from
tragedy
.

He
imagined
they
were
the
kind
whose
tax
returns
were
never
examined
(
if
they
were
,
they
were
never
penalized
)
,
whose
children
had
no
unhappy
romances
,
whose
names
never
knew
scandal
.

The
equation
was
simple
:
wealth
brought
them
happiness
,
and
their
united
front
to
the
world
was
their
warning
that
they
meant
to
keep
everything
they
had
,
let
no
one
in
on
the
secrets
.

Their
names
had
not
come
up
in
any
discussions
with
Laura
,
and
he
had
no
idea
what
they
would
be
like
.

Mrs.
Kahler
joined
them
.

She
had
a
dried-out
quality
--
a
gray
,
lean
woman
,
not
unattractive
.

Both
were
dressed
rather
formally
.

Kahler
continued
:
``
I
fixed
his
dog
the
other
day
and
I
guess
he's
sore
,
so
I
expected
him
to
come
barging
in
''
.

The
dog
refused
to
be
scared
off
,
so
Kahler
had
purchased
some
small
firecrackers
.

He
would
lay
in
wait
in
the
garage
,
and
when
the
terrier
came
scratching
around
,
he'd
let
fly
with
a
cherry
bomb
.

``
I
hit
him
in
the
ass
once
''
.

``
Finally
,
all
I
needed
was
to
throw
a
little
piece
of
red
wood
that
looked
like
a
firecracker
and
that
dumb
dog
would
run
ki-yi-ing
for
his
life
''
.

In
the
dim
underwater
light
they
dressed
and
straightened
up
the
room
,
and
then
they
went
across
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
.

She
appeared
with
the
teacart
and
he
opened
the
windows
.

Eugene
was
not
entirely
silent
,
or
openly
rude
--
unless
asking
Harold
to
move
to
another
chair
and
placing
himself
in
the
fauteuil
that
creaked
so
alarmingly
was
an
act
of
rudeness
.

Eugene
told
him
and
he
promptly
forgot
.

Before
he
left
the
apartment
he
knocked
on
their
door
and
asked
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
for
them
.

In
the
room
next
to
theirs
was
a
huge
cradle
,
of
mahogany
,
ornately
carved
and
decorated
with
gold
leaf
.

It
was
the
most
important-looking
cradle
he
had
ever
seen
.

Mme
Vienot
,
considerably
younger
and
very
different
.

The
schoolboy
.

One
of
the
drawing-room
shutters
was
partly
open
and
he
made
out
the
shapes
of
chairs
and
sofas
,
which
seemed
to
be
upholstered
in
brown
or
russet
velvet
.

The
curtains
were
of
the
same
material
,
and
there
were
some
big
oil
paintings
--
portraits
in
the
style
of
Lancret
and
Boucher
.

The
apex
,
the
study
where
Eugene
slept
,
was
light
and
bright
and
airy
and
cheerful
.

The
daybed
Eugene
had
slept
in
,
made
up
now
with
its
dark-brown
velours
cover
and
pillows
.

No
poetry
.

The
concierge
called
out
to
them
as
they
were
passing
through
the
foyer
.

He
waited
until
they
were
inside
the
elevator
and
then
said
:
``
Now
what
do
we
do
''
?
?

They
looked
,
even
so
.

Barbara
bought
some
cotton
aprons
,
and
Harold
bought
shoestrings
.

They
had
lunch
at
a
sidewalk
cafe
overlooking
the
intersection
of
two
broad
,
busy
,
unpicturesque
streets
,
and
coming
home
they
got
lost
in
the
Metro
;
;

It
was
the
end
of
the
afternoon
when
he
took
the
huge
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
inserted
it
into
the
keyhole
.

``
Well
,
this
is
France
,
after
all
''
.

``
And
for
that
he
needs
a
little
bag
''
?
?

They
went
shopping
in
the
neighborhood
,
and
bought
two
loaves
of
bread
with
the
ration
coupons
they
had
been
given
in
Blois
,
and
some
cheese
,
and
a
dozen
eggs
,
and
a
bag
of
oranges
from
a
peddler
in
the
Place
Redoute
--
the
first
oranges
they
had
seen
since
they
landed
.

They
could
have
been
perfectly
happy
here
for
ten
whole
days
.

But
where
do
people
go
swimming
in
Paris
?
?

That
boat
in
the
river
,
maybe
''
.

She
looked
at
him
in
surprise
.

``
I
don't
know
what
I'm
going
to
do
with
you
''
.

``
I
don't
think
it
was
that
,
really
''
.

They
took
Jesus's
body
,
then
,
and
wrapped
it
in
winding-clothes
with
the
spices
;
;

Search
as
he
might
,
he
could
find
no
place
where
the
Bible
spoke
of
a
moment
when
Mary
could
have
been
alone
with
Jesus
.

When
might
Mary
have
had
that
moment
to
hold
her
child
on
her
lap
?
?

Now
she
was
intensely
alive
,
anguished
;
;

her
son
was
dead
.

only
what
Mary
felt
for
her
son
.

He
started
by
making
free
sketches
to
loosen
up
his
thinking
so
that
images
would
appear
on
paper
.

At
the
same
time
he
started
walking
the
streets
,
peering
at
the
people
passing
or
shopping
at
the
stalls
,
storing
up
fresh
impressions
of
what
they
looked
like
,
how
they
moved
.

No
fold
could
be
accidental
,
each
turn
of
the
drapery
had
to
serve
organically
,
to
cover
the
Madonna's
slender
legs
and
feet
so
that
they
would
give
substantive
support
to
Christ's
body
,
to
intensify
her
inner
turmoil
.

They
can
have
as
much
tactile
appeal
as
flesh
and
bone
''
.

That
is
why
our
creative
people
give
their
time
to
literature
,
not
to
painting
or
sculpture
''
.

Each
religion
has
its
own
tenets
''
.

I'm
sure
he
would
approve
''
.

Rabbi
Melzi
smiled
at
him
with
infinitely
old
but
merry
eyes
.

Together
he
and
Argiento
built
the
stand
,
covering
it
with
blankets
.

His
first
model
arrived
at
dusk
.

only
the
instructions
from
his
rabbi
kept
him
from
bolting
.

He
drew
toward
the
composite
design
from
his
meticulously
accurate
memory
,
without
need
to
consult
his
sketches
.

Next
he
turned
to
wax
because
there
was
a
similarity
of
wax
to
marble
in
tactile
quality
and
translucence
.

the
wax
he
smoothed
over
to
give
the
body
surface
an
elastic
pull
.

Yet
he
never
allowed
these
models
to
become
fixed
in
his
mind
;
;

too
careful
or
detailed
studies
in
clay
and
wax
would
have
glued
him
down
to
a
mere
enlarging
of
his
model
.

``
You're
too
clean
.

``
No
''
,
said
Argiento
stolidly
.

``
Every
day
.

yet
he
knew
that
he
had
nothing
to
grumble
about
,
for
Argiento
made
few
demands
on
him
.

On
Sundays
he
would
walk
miles
into
the
campagna
to
visit
with
them
,
and
in
particular
to
see
their
horses
.

``
Today
I
go
see
the
horses
''
.

He
was
crouched
over
his
anvil
in
the
courtyard
getting
his
chisels
into
trim
,
when
a
splinter
of
steel
flew
into
his
eye
and
imbedded
itself
in
his
pupil
.

He
assumed
he
could
blink
the
splinter
out
.

Galli
arrived
with
his
family
surgeon
,
Maestro
Lippi
.

When
he
told
her
God
had
called
the
child
to
Him
,
she
rejected
his
words
rebelliously
.

She
had
even
steeled
herself
to
keep
Juanita
upstairs
in
the
nurse's
room
off
the
empty
nursery
,
although
the
girl
tried
to
insist
on
moving
back
to
the
quarters
to
spare
Kate
remembrance
of
the
baby's
death
.

He
claimed
to
be
visiting
the
waterfront
saloon
at
the
crossroads
to
play
cards
and
drink
with
his
cronies
,
but
Kate
had
not
smelled
brandy
on
him
since
Mrs.
Lattimer's
funeral
.

I
aim
to
keep
a
little
whisky
still
back
in
the
ridge
for
my
pleasure
''
.

Hearing
his
voice
ring
raucously
up
from
the
road
,
Kate
would
await
him
anxiously
and
watch
perplexed
as
he
walked
into
the
house
,
cold
sober
.

What
he
was
about
became
clear
to
her
with
the
circulation
of
another
broadside
proclamation
by
General
McClellan
,
threatening
reprisals
against
Rebel
guerrillas
.

Kate
drew
more
and
more
on
her
affection
for
Joel
through
the
hot
days
of
summer
work
.

Kate
had
walked
past
the
school
on
her
morning
chores
and
had
seen
the
whole
incident
,
had
seen
Joel's
burning
humiliation
before
Miss
Snow's
cold
,
bespectacled
wrath
.

He
had
the
hardest
pains
of
growing
before
him
now
,
as
he
approached
twelve
.

Whenever
she
found
time
,
she
went
blackberry
picking
with
him
,
and
they
would
come
home
together
,
mouths
purple
,
arms
and
faces
scratched
,
tired
enough
to
forget
grief
for
another
day
.

They
stayed
in
their
own
world
on
the
bluff
,
waiting
for
letters
and
the
peddler
,
bringing
the
news
.

The
men
were
restive
,
he
wrote
,
ready
to
take
the
battle
to
the
enemy
as
Jackson
wished
.

Dangling
his
gaudy
trinkets
before
them
,
he
told
of
the
Rebel
losses
in
the
mountains
,
at
Cheat
and
Rich
mountains
both
,
and
the
Federal
march
on
Beverly
.

They
won't
never
git
over
inter
loyal
western
Virginia
,
them
traitors
!
!

Rumor
of
a
big
battle
spread
like
a
grassfire
up
the
valley
.

``
All
dey
know
down
dere
is
it
were
at
Manassas
Junction
and
it
were
a
big
fight
''
,
the
old
man
told
them
.

The
week
after
Manassas
the
sound
of
horses
in
the
yard
brought
Kate
up
in
shock
from
an
afternoon's
rest
when
she
saw
the
Federal
soldiers
from
her
upstairs
window
.

She
remembered
McClellan's
last
proclamation
as
she
hurried
fearfully
down
the
stairs
.

As
Kate
came
swiftly
down
the
stairs
to
the
hall
she
saw
Colonel
Marsh
framed
in
the
doorway
,
his
face
set
in
the
same
vulnerable
look
Juanita
wore
.

``
It
was
a
terrible
loss
to
me
''
,
said
Kate
quietly
,
feeling
the
pain
twist
again
at
the
mention
,
knowing
now
that
Juanita
must
have
written
to
him
at
Grafton
.

He
has
notified
me
that
he
has
orders
to
go
to
Washington
to
take
over
the
Army
of
the
Potomac
.

``
Stay
here
in
the
parlor
where
it's
cool
''
,
she
said
,
trying
to
be
calm
.

When
Marsh
called
to
his
aide
and
the
pair
rode
off
down
the
River
Road
where
the
gentians
burned
blue
,
Juanita
was
shaken
and
trying
not
to
cry
.

She
sought
Kate
out
upstairs
,
her
lips
trembling
.

He
knows
me
as
your
niece
,
which
,
of
course
,
I
am
.

But
I
am
a
slave
!
!

You
own
me
.

I
have
held
your
papers
of
manumission
since
I
married
Mr.
Lattimer
''
.

The
things
left
unsaid
they
both
felt
deeply
,
and
with
a
sigh
they
fell
back
on
the
well-stuffed
pillows
.

I
say
,
where
is
everyone
?
?

There
were
times
now
,
like
this
,
when
she
lost
control
of
the
time
count
and
moved
freely
back
and
forth
into
three
generations
.

Was
it
a
birthday
ball
?
?

David
Cortlandt
was
tired
beyond
almost
the
limits
of
his
flesh
.

He
would
cross
to
Manhattan
,
to
Harlem
Heights
,
before
morning
.

And
he
would
sleep
,
sleep
,
and
never
think
of
roads
and
horses'
sore
haunches
,
of
colonial
wars
.

Mynheer
,
Sir
Francis
,
the
valley
society
,
the
very
smell
of
the
river
on
his
right
purling
along
to
the
bay
past
fish
weirs
and
rocks
,
and
ahead
the
sleepy
ribbon
of
moon-drenched
road
.

He
pulled
out
one
of
them
and
cocked
it
.

It
was
a
grotesque
hen
,
five
or
six
feet
tall
.

He
drove
on
,
wary
and
shaken
.

The
Sons
were
out
tonight
.

Chapter
10

From
there
it
looked
across
at
Westchester
County
and
the
Hudson
River
where
the
manor
houses
,
estates
,
and
big
farms
of
the
original
(
non-Indian
)
landowners
began
.

On
the
east
side
of
the
island
of
Manhattan
the
indifferent
hawk
knew
the
East
River
that
connected
New
York
Bay
with
Long
Island
Sound
.

On
the
shores
north
and
south
,
the
fishers
and
mooncursers
--
smugglers
--
lived
along
the
churning
Great
South
Bay
and
the
narrow
barrier
of
sand
,
Fire
Island
.

The
larger
ships
were
near
Paulus
Hook
,
already
being
called
,
by
a
few
,
Jersey
City
.

Along
Wappinger
Creek
in
Dutchess
County
,
past
the
white
church
at
Fishkill
,
past
Verplanck's
Point
on
the
east
bank
of
the
Hudson
,
to
the
white
salt-crusted
roads
of
the
Long
Island
Rockaways
there
was
a
watching
and
an
activity
of
preparing
for
something
explosive
to
happen
.

Waited
for
more
ships
,
more
lobster-backed
infantry
,
and
asked
what
was
to
be
done
with
a
war
of
rebellion
?
?

David
Cortlandt
,
having
slept
away
a
day
and
a
night
,
came
awake
in
a
plank
farmhouse
on
the
Harlem
River
near
Spuyten
Duyvil
.

The
road
seemed
animated
with
a
few
more
wagons
than
usual
;
;

The
wraith-like
events
of
the
last
few
days
flooded
David's
mind
and
he
rubbed
his
unshaved
chin
and
felt
again
the
ache
in
his
kidneys
caused
by
his
saddle
odyssey
from
Boston
.

He
had
sent
the
dispatches
downtown
to
the
proper
people
and
had
slept
.

He
scratched
his
mosquito-plagued
neck
.

From
the
saddlebags
,
hung
on
a
Hitchcock
chair
,
David
took
out
a
good
English
razor
,
a
present
from
John
Hunter
.

Yet
some
,
like
Morris
Manderscheid
,
would
bankrupt
themselves
for
the
new
ideas
.

war
was
a
smugglers'
heaven
.

Things
like
that
would
increase
rather
than
be
done
away
with
.

One
had
to
believe
in
final
events
or
one
was
stranded
in
the
abyss
of
nothing
.

He
drove
sensual
patterns
off
,
carefully
shaving
his
long
upper
lip
.

The
future
would
happen
;
;

He
wondered
how
they
could
go
on
in
poverty
,
superstition
,
ignorance
,
with
a
complete
lack
of
desire
to
make
either
their
land
or
their
lives
flourish
.

It
aggravated
him
.

When
Alexander
Brandel
rose
to
speak
,
the
hall
became
silent
.

Beyond
the
forest
all
our
paths
merge
into
a
single
great
highway
which
ends
in
the
barren
,
eroded
hills
of
Judea
.

It
had
sounded
good
to
Andrei
,
but
he
did
not
believe
it
.

Before
he
went
into
battle
Andrei
had
told
Alex
,
``
I
only
want
to
be
a
Pole
.

Once
there
had
been
big
glittering
rooms
where
Ulanys
bowed
and
kissed
the
ladies'
hands
as
they
flirted
from
behind
their
fans
.

I
am
a
Jew
''
.

I
hate
Warsaw
,
he
said
to
himself
.

I
hate
Poland
and
all
the
goddamned
mothers'
sons
of
them
.

All
of
Poland
is
a
coffin
.

Only
Palestine
,
and
I
will
never
live
to
see
Palestine
because
I
did
not
believe
.

Jews
.

The
Bathyrans
ran
a
check
on
Globocnik
and
had
only
to
conclude
that
he
was
in
a
tug
of
war
with
Hans
Frank
and
the
civilian
administrators
.

A
tale
of
a
massive
reservation
in
the
Uplands
to
hold
several
million
Jews
A
tale
of
a
plan
to
ship
all
Jews
to
the
island
of
Madagascar
Stories
of
the
depravity
of
the
guards
at
Globocnik's
camps
struck
a
chord
of
terror
at
the
mere
mention
of
their
names
.

Was
Operation
Reinhard
the
same
pattern
for
the
daily
trains
now
leaving
the
Umschlagplatz
in
Warsaw
?
?

Styka
sat
beside
him
and
pumped
his
hand
excitedly
.

To
him
,
Andrei
Androfski
had
always
been
the
living
symbol
of
a
Polish
officer
.

Nothing
like
the
old
days
in
the
army
,
but
I
get
by
.

Many
times
I
tried
to
reach
you
,
but
I
never
knew
how
.

Andrei
asked
.

``
He
is
aware
he
will
not
live
for
twenty-four
hours
if
he
betrays
you
''
.

The
stories
Everyone
really
knows
what
is
happening
there
''
.

``
What
good
will
it
really
do
''
?
?

Perhaps
if
they
know
the
story
there
will
be
a
massive
cry
of
indignation
''
.

But
my
captain
might
have
been
a
Jew
,
but
he
wasn't
a
Jew
.

The
men
of
our
company
had
a
dozen
fights
defending
your
name
.

``
But
we
are
neither
blind
nor
insane
.

The
men
of
your
company
would
not
allow
your
name
dishonored
.

``
My
cousin
works
at
the
Labor
Bureau
.

``
Orders
from
the
Home
Army
''
.

Nothing
there
but
Jews
''
.

``
We
get
strange
orders
''
.

Andrei
and
Styka
were
silent
.

I
didn't
want
her
back
on
that
broken
record
.

``
I
am
''
,
she
said
.

That
evening
turned
out
to
be
hell
like
all
the
others
.

``
I
could
scratch
her
eyes
out
''
,
Eileen
cried
and
stamped
her
foot
when
I
came
back
from
the
phone
booth
.

There
was
a
man's
jacket
on
the
chair
and
a
straw
hat
on
the
table
.

I'll
just
tell
him
you're
my
husband
.

``
That
really
would
be
funny
''
.

Eileen
declared
she
couldn't
lift
her
head
from
the
pillow
.

I
was
stumbling
in
my
undershirt
trying
to
find
my
way
around
her
damn
kitchenette
when
I
smelt
that
sickish
sweet
hairtonic
smell
.

Brown
eyes
,
eyebrow
mustache
.

``
And
don't
either
of
you
forget
that
I'm
not
any
man's
property
.

She
was
enjoying
the
situation
.

Eileen
was
a
psychologist
all
right
.

Maybe
he
felt
the
same
way
.

I
never
felt
such
a
lowdown
hound
in
my
life
.

Of
course
I
had
to
give
her
Eileen's
address
,
but
she
never
came
near
us
.

What
I
did
know
was
that
Precious
was
always
around
.

He
slept
in
the
hall
bedroom
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
.

You
wouldn't
have
me
throw
the
poor
boy
out
on
the
street
''
,
Eileen
said
when
I
needled
her
about
it
.

I
said
sure
that
was
what
I
wanted
her
to
do
but
she
paid
no
attention
.

Eileen
had
a
wonderful
way
of
not
listening
to
things
she
didn't
want
to
hear
.

To
be
on
the
safe
side
I
never
let
Eileen
get
out
of
my
sight
day
or
night
.

He
was
smooth
and
civil
spoken
but
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
something
tough
under
his
selfeffacing
manner
.

Whenever
the
place
was
cleaned
or
a
meal
served
it
was
Precious
who
did
the
work
.

I
never
could
find
out
what
his
business
was
.

``
Connections
''
was
all
he
would
say
with
that
smooth
hurt
smile
when
I
put
leading
questions
.

Poor
devil
he
can't
have
been
too
happy
either
.

The
trouble
was
drinking
cost
money
.

I
raised
some
kale
by
hocking
the
good
clothes
I
had
left
over
from
my
respectable
uptown
life
,
but
when
that
was
gone
I
didn't
have
a
cent
.

I
don't
know
what
we
would
have
done
if
Pat
O'Dwyer
hadn't
come
to
town
.

Now
Pat
may
have
been
a
lecher
and
a
plugugly
,
but
he
was
a
good
churchgoing
Catholic
and
he
loved
his
little
sister
.

It
had
gone
big
with
the
Hollywood
girls
when
he
told
them
his
sister
was
an
editor
of
Art
And
Apparel
.

All
evening
Eileen
had
been
as
demure
as
a
little
girl
getting
ready
for
her
first
communion
.

It
just
about
blew
us
both
out
of
the
water
when
Eileen
suddenly
came
out
with
what
she
came
out
with
.

My
first
thought
was
how
had
it
happened
so
soon
,
but
I
counted
back
on
my
fingers
and
sure
enough
we'd
been
living
together
six
weeks
.

Greatest
thing
that
ever
happened
.

But
perhaps
this
was
a
part
of
the
eternal
plan
,
that
man's
ambition
when
linked
with
God
would
be
a
driving
,
indefatigable
force
for
good
in
the
world
.

How
foolish
it
was
to
try
to
fathom
the
truth
in
an
area
where
only
faith
would
suffice
.

he
was
to
try
to
make
no
converts
;
;

It
was
a
ridiculous
situation
and
Rector
knew
it
,
for
Hino
,
frankly
partisan
,
openly
gregarious
,
would
make
a
poor
espionage
agent
.

He
had
gone
into
the
Japanese
navy
,
had
been
trained
as
an
officer
,
had
participated
in
one
or
two
battles
--
he
never
went
into
detail
regarding
his
military
experience
--
and
at
the
age
of
twenty-five
,
quite
as
a
bolt
out
of
the
blue
,
he
had
walked
into
the
mission
as
if
he
belonged
here
and
had
become
a
Christian
.

``
I
will
be
expecting
them
''
.

He
had
something
more
to
say
.

``
Unless
the
oyabun
has
been
working
on
it
''
,
he
said
,
then
checked
himself
and
added
:
``
You
can
tell
Kayabashi-san
that
the
back
road
is
in
very
good
condition
and
will
be
quite
safe
for
his
party
to
use
''
.

No
,
Kayabashi
was
bringing
his
associates
here
for
a
specific
purpose
and
Rector
would
not
be
able
to
fathom
it
until
they
arrived
.

A
good
initial
impression
would
be
important
now
.

He
went
into
the
print
shop
,
where
Fletcher
had
just
finished
cleaning
the
press
.

``
Why
''
?
?

``
Fifteen
''
,
she
said
.

I
want
to
create
the
impression
of
a
compound
full
of
children
.

He
looked
out
over
the
expanse
of
the
compound
.

``
Have
you
ever
operated
a
transit
''
?
?

He
said
.

You'll
find
an
old
transit
in
the
basement
.

Johnson
nodded
.

It
was
rather
a
childish
game
,
all
in
all
,
but
everybody
seemed
to
be
getting
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
and
he
could
not
remember
when
he
had
enjoyed
planning
anything
quite
so
much
.

When
everything
had
been
done
,
Rector
went
back
to
his
desk
to
occupy
himself
with
his
monthly
report
until
three
o'clock
.

The
fish
took
the
bait
.

But
when
she
called
he
had
thought
better
of
the
matter
and
decided
not
to
involve
himself
in
a
new
entanglement
.

She
wrote
again
and
now
,
abandoning
for
the
moment
the
theme
of
love
,
she
asked
for
help
in
the
matter
of
her
career
.

She
could
act
and
she
could
write
.

She
opened
his
reply
with
trembling
fingers
he
agreed
!
!

She
sang
him
Scott's
charming
ballad
``
Rosabelle
''
,
which
was
the
vogue
of
the
moment
.

She
had
never
sung
better
.

There
have
been
cooing
doves
,
chattering
magpies
,
thieving
jackdaws
,
a
proud
peacock
,
a
silly
goose
,
and
a
harpy
eagle
--
whom
I
was
silly
enough
to
mate
with
and
who
is
now
busy
tearing
at
my
vitals
''
.

A
scant
half
mile
away
Shelley
and
Mary
were
doubtless
sitting
on
their
diminutive
terrace
,
the
air
about
them
scented
with
stock
,
and
listening
to
the
nightingale
who
had
nested
in
the
big
lime
tree
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
.

Charming
and
peaceful
--
but
what
were
charm
and
peace
compared
to
high
adventure
?
?

Mystery
--
that
was
the
thing
.

``
Seems
to
me
last
time
I
was
here
the
grate
bellowed
out
smoke
as
it
might
have
been
preparing
us
for
hell
''
.

So
don't
see
yourself
as
a
heroine
or
fancy
this
little
adventure
is
an
event
of
major
importance
''
.

``
Tell
me
about
Minerva
,
how
she
behaved
,
what
she
did
to
please
you
''
.

He
drew
her
close
and
,
hand
on
cheek
,
turned
her
face
to
his
.

Her
lips
,
moist
and
parted
,
spoke
his
name
.

But
,
kindled
by
his
kiss
,
his
caressing
hand
,
her
desire
was
aflame
.

By
odd
coincidence
,
on
the
evening
of
her
return
Shelley
chose
to
read
Parisina
,
which
was
the
latest
of
the
titled
poet's
successes
.

``
The
hero
of
his
next
poem
is
Napoleon
Bonaparte
''
,
said
Claire
,
with
slightly
overdone
carelessness
.

``
How
do
you
know
that
''
?
?

Demanded
Mary
.

``
I
promised
him
I
wouldn't
''
.

Alastor
was
published
only
to
be
savagely
attacked
,
contemptuously
ignored
.

Neither
acknowledged
the
gift
.

``
How
can
you
say
such
a
thing
?
?

What
about
that
dear
,
clever
Mr.
Thynne
?
?

Not
everyone
is
bewitched
by
Byron's
caliphs
and
harem
beauties
''
.

Mary's
supercritical
attitude
toward
Byron
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
moral
disrepute
.

The
lordly
poet
was
at
low-water
mark
.

Byron
,
since
the
separation
from
his
wife
had
been
living
in
a
smallish
house
in
Piccadilly
Terrace
.

He
had
thought
that
the
suggestion
of
taking
it
himself
would
tip
the
colonel
in
the
direction
of
serving
his
own
order
,
but
the
slip
of
paper
was
folded
and
absently
thrust
into
the
colonel's
belt
.

--
You
heard
me
.

This
is
no
damned
holiday
,
Beckworth
.

Below
he
could
see
the
bright
torches
lighting
the
riverbank
.

The
colonel
crouched
tensely
on
one
of
the
folding
chairs
,
methodically
tearing
at
his
thumbnail
.

In
the
corner
was
the
soldier
with
the
white
flag
.

He
stood
stiffly
erect
,
clutching
the
staff
,
his
body
half
hidden
by
the
limp
cloth
.

When
the
boat
had
touched
,
the
weaker
ones
and
the
two
wounded
men
had
been
lifted
out
and
carried
away
by
the
soldiers
.

The
officer
had
told
him
that
both
lists
must
be
checked
.

Watson
had
nodded
absently
and
muttered
that
he
would
check
the
lists
himself
later
.

The
men
he
would
take
back
across
the
river
stood
there
,
but
he
turned
away
from
them
.

He
had
hoped
to
be
alone
in
the
bombproof
,
but
the
soldier
had
followed
him
.

It
was
easier
to
think
now
,
Watson
decided
.

The
stiff
figure
in
the
corner
no
longer
blocked
his
thoughts
.

Why
had
he
crossed
the
dark
water
,
to
bring
back
a
group
of
reclaimed
soldiers
or
to
skulk
in
a
foul-smelling
hole
?
?

Wasn't
the
report
official
enough
?
?

For
what
?
?

Watson
ran
up
the
ladder
and
stood
for
a
second
sucking
in
the
cool
air
that
smelled
of
mud
and
river
weeds
.

To
his
left
,
the
two
skiffs
dented
their
sharp
bows
into
the
soft
bank
.

The
flat-bottomed
boat
swung
slowly
to
the
pull
of
the
current
.

A
soldier
held
the
end
of
a
frayed
rope
.

Watson
watched
two
of
them
flounder
into
the
shallow
water
and
listened
to
their
voices
beg
shrilly
.

He
stalked
into
the
water
and
fell
heavily
over
the
side
of
the
flat-bottomed
barge
,
his
weight
nearly
swamping
the
craft
.

he
crept
in
an
incertain
manner
,
patting
the
ground
before
him
.

Still
the
guards
did
not
move
,
but
stood
inert
,
aloof
from
the
slow-scrambling
man
.

Watson
raced
for
him
,
his
boots
slamming
the
soft
earth
.

The
guards
came
to
life
with
astonishing
menace
.

--
Let
me
help
him
,
for
the
love
of
God
!
!

Watson
stared
into
a
cadaverous
face
.

--
It
don't
matter
.

--
Not
far
.

--
You
talk
deep
.

Can
you
walk
?
?

--
Why
,
course
I
can
.

I
can
walk
real
good
.

He
heard
the
patient
voice
calling
.

--
Henry
?
?

Where
are
you
,
Henry
?
?

--
Goddamn
you
!
!

What
do
you
do
to
them
?
?

He
was
angry
,
sickened
.

All
his
emotions
had
been
inward
,
self-conscious
.

That
was
it
.

John's
type
of
man
allowed
this
sort
of
thing
to
happen
.

What
had
he
thought
of
,
to
go
to
John
,
grovel
and
beg
understanding
?
?

Let
him
chafe
with
impatience
to
see
Charles
,
rip
open
the
note
with
trembling
hands
and
read
the
formal
report
in
Hillman's
beautiful
,
schoolmaster's
hand
.

John
would
curse
.

He
believed
that
brave
boys
didn't
cry
.

But
the
shelter
is
as
much
a
part
of
my
landscape
as
the
beech
and
horse-chestnut
trees
that
grow
on
the
ridge
.

It
bulks
under
a
veil
of
thin
,
new
grass
,
like
some
embarrassing
fact
of
physicalness
,
and
I
think
Mrs.
Pastern
set
out
the
statuary
to
soften
its
meaning
.

He
was
marching
up
and
down
the
locker
room
of
the
Grassy
Brae
Golf
Club
shouting
,
``
Bomb
Cuba
!
!

Leaving
her
house
one
late
afternoon
,
Mrs.
Pastern
stopped
to
admire
the
October
light
.

It
was
the
day
to
canvass
for
infectious
hepatitis
.

Mrs.
Balcolm
worked
for
the
brain
.

She
stayed
too
late
,
and
when
she
left
,
it
was
dark
and
time
to
go
home
and
cook
supper
for
her
husband
.

``
Nobody
does
,
but
they
gave
me
ten
last
year
''
.

There
was
a
glass
pane
in
the
front
door
,
and
through
this
he
could
see
into
a
hallway
where
a
plump
woman
with
red
hair
was
arranging
flowers
.

She
took
a
good
look
at
herself
in
the
mirror
before
she
turned
and
,
walking
with
very
small
steps
,
started
toward
the
door
.

``
And
I
am
not
sure
that
I
have
any
cash
--
any
money
,
that
is
--
but
if
you
will
wait
just
a
minute
I
will
write
you
out
a
check
if
I
can
find
my
checkbook
.

Travelling
home
on
a
late
train
?
?

Changing
his
clothes
upstairs
?
?

Taking
a
shower
?
?

At
the
end
of
the
room
there
was
a
desk
heaped
with
papers
,
and
she
began
to
riffle
these
,
making
sighs
and
and
noises
of
girlish
exasperation
.

Everything's
on
the
table
''
.

Her
voice
dropped
.

He
travelled
all
over
the
world
.

Her
voice
shook
with
feeling
,
and
he
thought
it
lovely
.

He
didn't
doubt
her
truthfulness
,
although
he
had
heard
the
words
a
hundred
times
.

``
I've
never
done
this
before
''
,
they
always
said
,
waiting
for
the
elevator
in
the
hotel
corridor
.

``
Where
have
you
been
''
?
?

``
It's
after
eleven
''
.

Charlie
ate
some
supper
in
the
kitchen
and
went
into
the
TV
room
to
hear
the
news
.

He
shouted
.

Then
he
played
nine
imaginary
holes
of
golf
,
choosing
his
handicap
,
his
irons
,
his
stance
,
his
opponents
,
and
his
weather
in
detail
,
but
the
green
of
the
links
seemed
faded
in
the
light
of
his
business
worries
.

His
money
was
tied
up
in
a
Nassau
hotel
,
an
Ohio
pottery
works
,
and
a
detergent
for
window-washing
,
and
luck
had
been
running
against
him
.

His
worries
harried
him
up
out
of
bed
,
and
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
went
to
the
window
.

In
the
starlight
he
could
see
the
trees
stripped
of
their
leaves
.

Maple
and
ash
,
beech
and
elm
,
one
hundred
to
win
on
Three
in
the
fourth
,
fifty
to
win
on
Six
in
the
third
,
one
hundred
to
win
on
Two
in
the
eighth
.

Children
walking
home
from
school
would
scuff
through
what
seemed
to
be
his
foliage
.

It
was
not
as
though
she
noted
clearly
that
her
nephews
had
not
been
to
see
her
for
ten
years
,
not
since
their
last
journey
eastward
to
witness
their
Uncle
Izaak
being
lowered
into
the
rocky
soil
;
;

I
should
be
obliged
if
you
could
make
other
arrangements
for
your
daughters
.

She
signed
the
letters
quickly
,
stamped
them
,
and
placed
them
on
the
hall
table
for
Raphael
to
mail
in
town
.

from
the
early
evening
lights
of
them
which
had
first
startled
Izaak
to
look
at
her
in
an
uncousinly
way
,
they
had
faded
to
a
near-absence
of
color
which
had
,
possibly
from
her
constant
looking
at
the
water
,
something
of
the
light
of
the
sea
in
them
.

She
smiled
,
and
the
teeth
gleamed
in
her
beautifully
modeled
olive
face
.

Her
voice
was
ripe
and
full
and
her
teeth
flashed
again
in
Sicilian
brilliance
before
the
warm
curved
lips
met
and
her
mouth
settled
in
repose
.

The
name
fell
with
lazy
affectionate
remembrance
from
her
lips
.

For
an
instant
the
old
aunt
felt
something
indefinable
flash
through
her
smile
.

Then
Angelina
turned
and
with
an
easy
grace
walked
toward
the
kitchen
.

Procreation
,
expansion
,
proliferation
--
these
are
the
laws
of
living
things
,
with
the
penalty
for
not
obeying
them
the
ultimate
in
punishments
:
oblivion
.

She
ate
.

She
thought
again
of
her
children
,
those
two
who
had
died
young
,
before
the
later
science
which
might
have
saved
them
could
attach
even
a
label
to
their
separate
malignancies
.

There
was
stability
there
,
too
--
a
color
which
his
life
had
had
once
.

Mark
held
the
wheel
loosely
,
but
his
fingers
curved
around
it
in
a
purposeful
way
and
the
deliberate
set
of
his
body
spoke
plainly
of
the
figure
he'd
make
in
the
years
to
come
.

His
sandy
hair
was
already
beginning
to
thin
and
recede
at
the
sides
,
and
Abel
looked
quickly
away
.

``
She
didn't
mention
bringing
Myra
''
,
Mark
said
,
maneuvering
the
car
into
the
next
lane
.

Abel
ignored
the
half-expressed
bid
for
confirmation
.

He
could
tell
they
were
approaching
the
sea
.

There
was
the
smell
of
the
coast
,
like
a
primeval
memory
,
composed
of
equal
parts
salt
water
,
clams
,
seaweed
and
northern
air
.

They
seemed
then
to
have
had
a
single
mind
and
body
,
a
mutuality
which
had
been
accepted
with
the
fact
of
their
youth
,
casually
.

They
came
unexpectedly
upon
the
sea
.

That
would
make
him
mad
enough
if
he
was
sober
.

I
was
leaning
too
far
over
.

I
knew
better
.

It
was
better
,
though
,
he'd
hit
me
.

``
Get
the
hell
out
of
here
''
.

``
A
fat
hell
on
Big
Hans
.

``
Get
the
hell
out
''
.

Hans
is
rubbing
him
with
snow
.

``
Pedersen
''
?
?

``
You
don't
understand
,
Pa
.

That
cock
.

Why
should
I
?
?

Pedersen
.

Don't
come
back
.

He
had
long
black
hairs
on
his
wrist
.

He's
an
even
bigger
fool
than
you
are
.

Out
.

He
might
not
have
gone
that
far
if
Pa
hadn't
been
locked
in
laughing
fit
to
shake
the
house
.

Hans
had
laid
steaming
towels
over
the
kid's
chest
and
stomach
.

``
What'd
he
say
?
?

``
Don't
be
smart
.

``
Go
back
to
sleep
most
likely
''
.

``
Listen
to
me
,
Jorge
,
I've
had
enough
to
your
sassing
.

You
want
the
kid
to
die
?
?

Get
pig-drunk
--
that's
what
he
wants
.

I'd
wound
Big
Hans
up
tight
.

Not
any
more
.

Hans
rubbed
the
kid
with
more
snow
rubbed
rubbed
.

I
don't
know
where
Ma
went
.

I
thought
she'd
gone
upstairs
and
expected
to
hear
she
had
.

Oh
,
he
was
being
queer
and
careful
,
pawing
about
in
the
drawer
and
holding
the
bottle
like
a
snake
at
the
length
of
his
arm
.

They
were
always
trying
so
you
got
to
expect
it
.

Now
Hans
had
given
Ma
something
of
his
--
we
both
had
when
we
thought
she
was
going
straight
to
Pa
--
something
valuable
;
;

She'd
found
it
by
luck
most
likely
but
she
hadn't
said
anything
and
we
didn't
know
how
long
ago
it'd
been
or
how
many
other
ones
she'd
found
,
saying
nothing
.

But
he'd
find
out
about
this
one
because
we
were
using
it
.

A
fool
could
see
what
was
going
on
.

But
he
didn't
figure
Ma
for
much
.

``
You
going
to
put
more
towels
on
him
''
?
?

That's
what
he
needs
,
something
warm
to
his
skin
,
don't
he
''
?
?

That's
why
I
only
put
towels
on
his
chest
and
belly
.

``
What
are
we
going
to
do
with
these
''
?
?

Big
Hans
began
pouring
whisky
in
the
kid's
mouth
but
his
mouth
filled
without
any
getting
down
his
throat
and
in
a
second
it
was
dripping
from
his
chin
.

``
Here
,
help
me
prop
him
up
.

``
I
can't
''
.

``
Don't
hold
him
like
that
.

Just
hold
him
like
I
told
you
''
.

I
had
my
arm
behind
his
back
.

He
was
in
his
mid-fifties
at
this
time
,
long
past
the
establishment
of
his
name
and
the
wish
to
be
lionized
yet
once
again
,
and
it
was
almost
a
decade
since
he
had
sworn
off
lecturing
.

This
was
an
enormously
long
building
whose
walls
were
made
of
rocks
,
some
of
them
brought
home
from
every
continent
during
his
six
years
as
an
oil
geologist
.

Everywhere
else
his
ideas
lay
or
hung
in
visible
form
:
his
models
,
drawings
,
ten-foot
canvases
in
monochromes
from
his
painting
days
,
and
underfoot
a
windfall
of
broken-backed
books
that
looked
as
though
their
insides
had
been
ransacked
by
a
maniac
.

He
worked
standing
,
with
his
left
hand
in
his
pocket
as
though
he
were
merely
stopping
for
a
moment
,
sketching
with
the
surprised
stare
of
one
who
was
watching
another
person's
hand
.

Sometimes
he
would
grunt
softly
to
some
invisible
onlooker
beside
him
,
sometimes
he
would
look
stern
and
moralistic
as
his
pencil
did
what
he
disapproved
.

It
all
seemed
--
if
one
could
have
peeked
in
at
him
through
one
of
his
windows
--
as
though
this
broken-nosed
man
with
the
muscular
arms
and
wrestler's
neck
was
merely
the
caretaker
trying
his
hand
at
the
boss's
work
.

This
air
of
disengagement
carried
over
to
his
apparent
attitude
toward
his
things
,
and
people
often
mistook
it
for
boredom
in
him
or
a
surrender
to
repetitious
routine
.

He
would
wear
this
same
costume
in
Florida
,
despite
his
wife
Cleota's
reminders
over
the
past
five
days
that
he
must
take
some
cool
clothes
with
him
.

an
explosive
laugh
which
always
carried
everything
before
it
.

Now
she
kept
herself
protectively
ready
to
laugh
again
and
sure
enough
he
pointed
at
her
with
his
index
finger
and
said
``
Toot
''
!
!

Once
more
and
roared
off
into
the
fog
,
his
foot
evidently
surprising
him
with
the
suddenness
with
which
it
pressed
the
accelerator
,
just
as
his
hand
did
when
he
worked
.

she
could
dust
the
plants
,
then
break
off
suddenly
and
pick
up
an
old
novel
and
read
from
the
middle
on
;
;

Every
few
minutes
she
would
awaken
for
a
moment
to
review
things
:
Stowey
,
yes
,
was
on
his
way
south
,
and
the
two
boys
were
away
in
school
,
and
nothing
was
burning
on
the
stove
,
and
Lucretia
was
coming
for
dinner
and
bringing
three
guests
of
hers
.

Then
she
fell
asleep
again
as
soddenly
as
a
person
with
fever
,
and
when
she
awoke
it
was
dark
outside
and
the
clarity
was
back
in
her
eyes
.

They
were
both
so
young
,
after
all
,
so
unready
for
any
final
parting
.

But
yes
,
nineteen
plus
thirty
was
forty-nine
,
and
she
was
forty-nine
and
she
had
been
married
at
nineteen
.

Enjoy
being
a
bride
while
you
can
''
.

Without
saying
so
,
she
was
really
grateful
;
;

She
had
made
curtains
for
all
the
windows
of
her
little
house
,
and
she
had
kept
it
spotless
and
neat
,
shabby
as
it
was
,
and
cooked
good
meals
for
Bobby
Joe
.

Now
there
was
no
work
in
the
fields
,
nor
would
there
be
till
it
rained
,
and
she
did
not
know
where
he
went
.

The
women
,
keeping
their
voices
low
as
they
worked
around
the
house
or
sat
in
the
living
room
,
sounded
like
chickens
shut
up
in
a
coop
for
the
night
.

There
was
much
embracing
,
much
exclaiming
.

Cousin
John
''
!
!

All
the
women
got
up
and
offered
their
chairs
,
and
when
they
were
all
seated
again
,
the
guests
made
their
inquiries
and
their
explanations
.

There
was
the
suggestion
of
ice
water
,
and
--
in
spite
of
the
protest
``
We're
not
really
thirsty
''
--
Linda
Kay
,
to
escape
the
stuffy
air
and
the
smothering
soft
voices
,
hurried
to
the
kitchen
.

``
She
married
our
baby
boy
,
Bobby
Joe
,
this
summer
''
.

We
didn't
expect
him
to
come
along
;
;

thought
for
the
longest
he
was
a
tumor
''
.

``
Oh
he's
a
second
cousin
or
something
.

Linda
Kay
asked
.

There
was
really
no
reason
to
refuse
,
and
Linda
Kay
had
never
ridden
in
a
Cadillac
.

Bobby
Joe
would
be
a
senior
this
year
,
and
he
planned
to
graduate
.

Howard
sighed
.

Of
course
he
couldn't
say
much
,
really
,
because
of
Debora
,
but
Linda
Kay
could
imagine
what
kind
of
woman
his
wife
had
been
and
what
a
raw
deal
he
had
got
.

It
made
her
feel
different
about
Howard
.

She
was
going
to
tell
Bobby
Joe
about
how
mistaken
she
had
been
,
but
he
brought
one
of
the
cousins
home
for
supper
,
and
all
they
did
was
talk
about
antelope
.

Bobby
Joe
and
two
or
three
of
the
other
boys
declared
they
had
never
been
possum-hunting
,
and
Uncle
Bill
Farnworth
(
from
Mama
Albright's
side
of
the
family
)
said
he
would
just
get
up
from
there
and
take
them
,
right
then
.

Bobby
Joe
had
been
sitting
close
to
her
,
touching
her
actually
,
and
holding
her
hand
from
time
to
time
,
but
it
seemed
at
once
that
Howard
sat
much
closer
.

The
doctor
paid
the
bill
and
they
repaired
to
the
hotel
,
room
number
nine
,
to
initiate
Alex
further
into
these
undertakings
.

Inside
,
carefully
packed
in
straw
,
were
six
eggs
,
but
the
eye
of
a
poultry
psychologist
was
required
to
detect
what
scientifically
valuable
specimentalia
lay
inside
;
;

The
ledger
was
full
of
most
precise
information
:
date
of
laying
,
length
of
incubation
period
,
number
of
chick
reaching
the
first
week
,
second
week
,
fifth
week
,
weight
of
hen
,
size
of
rooster's
wattles
and
so
on
,
all
scrawled
out
in
a
hand
that
looked
more
Chinese
than
English
,
the
most
jagged
and
sprawling
Alex
had
ever
seen
.

Below
these
particulars
was
a
series
of
alpha-beta-gammas
connected
by
arrows
and
crosses
which
denoted
the
lineage
of
the
breed
.

Alex's
instruction
was
rapid
,
for
the
doctor
had
to
go
off
to
the
Rue
Ecole
De
Medecine
to
hear
more
speeches
with
only
time
for
one
sip
of
wine
to
sustain
him
through
them
all
.

The
doctor
stood
about
,
waiting
for
Alex
to
dress
,
with
a
show
of
impatience
,
and
soon
they
were
moving
,
as
quietly
as
could
be
,
through
the
still-dark
hallways
,
past
the
bedroom
of
the
patronne
,
and
so
into
the
street
.

It
was
a
fine
broody
hen
,
white
,
with
a
maternal
eye
and
a
striking
abundance
of
feathers
in
the
under
region
of
the
abdomen
.

The
doctor
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
professional
interests
have
found
scope
,
drew
Alex's
attention
to
those
excellences
which
might
otherwise
have
escaped
him
:
the
fine
color
in
comb
and
wattles
,
the
length
and
quality
of
neck
and
saddle
hackles
,
the
firm
,
wide
spread
of
the
toes
,
and
a
rare
justness
in
the
formation
of
the
ear
lappets
.

All
search
was
ended
;
;

he
had
found
his
fowl
.

The
doctor
was
wearing
a
long
New
England
greatcoat
,
hardly
necessary
in
the
June
weather
but
a
garment
which
proved
well
adapted
to
the
sequestration
of
hens
.

Their
hostess
enquired
.

Alex
told
her
that
there
was
no
hurry
for
their
breakfasts
,
trying
at
the
same
time
to
effect
a
speedy
separation
of
the
persons
before
and
behind
him
.

Ejaculated
the
surprised
woman
,
looking
at
Alex
for
an
explanation
but
he
,
parting
from
her
without
ceremony
,
only
offered
a
few
words
about
the
doctor's
provincial
American
speech
and
a
state
of
nerves
brought
on
by
the
demands
of
his
work
.

Anyhow
she's
coming
back
in
five
minutes
to
do
the
room
''
.

The
doctor's
mind
was
working
at
a
great
speed
;
;

they
climbed
the
stairs
which
creaked
,
very
loudly
to
their
sensitive
ears
,
and
reached
the
next
floor
.

The
doctor
sat
down
rather
wearily
,
caressing
the
hen
and
remarking
that
the
city
was
not
the
place
for
a
poultry-loving
man
,
but
no
sooner
was
the
remark
out
than
a
knock
at
this
door
obliged
him
to
cover
the
hen
with
his
greatcoat
once
more
.

The
two
men
sat
for
some
time
,
savoring
the
pleasure
of
escape
from
peril
and
the
relief
such
escape
brings
,
before
they
got
up
and
left
the
hotel
,
the
doctor
to
go
to
the
conference
house
and
Alex
to
go
to
the
main
post
office
.

At
the
time
Alex
arrived
he
was
engaged
in
some
sort
of
intimate
communication
with
the
hen
,
who
had
settled
herself
on
the
nest
most
peacefully
after
the
occurrences
of
the
morning
.

``
Chickens
have
short
memories
''
,
the
doctor
remarked
,
``
that's
why
they
are
better
company
than
most
people
I
know
''
,
and
he
went
on
to
break
some
important
news
to
Alex
.

There
were
times
it
wasn't
right
to
make
a
person
happy
,
like
the
times
she
came
in
the
kitchen
and
asked
know
we
don't
keep
peanut
``
butter
for
a
peanut
butter
sandwich
.

You
in
this
house
''
,
he
always
told
her
.

But
he
knew
how
important
it
was
for
her
to
keep
her
figure
.

fine
hand
.

``
I
guess
I
better
get
ready
to
go
''
.

``
I
don't
want
to
leave
here
,
Winston
''
.

``
I
told
you
what
Miss
Ada's
doctor
said
''
.

What
you
think
I
care
about
that
?
?

She
sounded
as
though
they
already
existed
.

We've
only
been
married
four
years
,
January
''
.

Too
many
times
was
the
truth
of
it
,
Winston
thought
.

Winston
apologized
and
quickly
set
the
hat
right
.

Then
he
stood
back
to
look
at
Mr.
Jack
,
who
was
pulling
on
his
pigskin
gloves
.

Winston
watched
him
hurry
down
the
drive
to
his
car
;
;

The
tulips
and
the
big
pink
peonies
had
been
blooming
along
the
drive
,
and
he
had
walked
up
from
the
bus
almost
singing
.

She
had
dug
a
hole
for
each
bulb
,
each
tree
wore
a
tag
with
her
writing
on
it
;
;

Somehow
Winston
didn't
think
she'd
take
to
window
boxes
.

Frowning
,
Miss
Ada
studied
the
list
.

Winston
followed
her
around
the
room
,
collecting
the
small
frail
objects
(
Christmas
,
birthday
,
and
anniversary
)
and
wrapping
them
in
tissue
paper
.

She
smiled
at
Winston
,
and
he
saw
the
hateful
hard
glitter
in
her
eyes
.

``
At
least
you
could
leave
it
for
the
movers
''
,
Miss
Ada
said
.

``
What
possessed
you
to
tell
me
a
clotheshorse
would
be
a
good
idea
''
?
?

every
morning
,
I
lay
out
his
clothes
on
it
''
.

``
Well
,
that's
over
now
.

``
Mr.
Jack
sets
store
by
that
''
.

``
Really
,
Winston
.

It
was
meant
to
be
my
present
''
.

But
she
went
on
down
the
list
.

Winston
was
relieved
;
;

those
presents
had
been
on
his
mind
.

``
Picture
!
!

On
Christmas
night
,
they
had
had
a
disagreement
about
it
.

Through
the
door
,
he
had
seen
Mr.
Jack
walking
around
,
waiting
for
Miss
Ada
.

``
You
look
like
that
picture
I
have
at
the
office
''
,
Mr.
Jack
had
started
.

Make
the
man
put
them
in
if
he
has
to
''
.

After
that
they
had
sat
for
five
minutes
without
saying
a
word
.

I
lived
to
see
an
envelope
of
hers
in
the
morning
mail
and
to
lock
myself
in
my
room
in
the
afternoon
to
reread
her
letter
for
the
tenth
time
and
finally
prepare
an
answer
.

My
memory
has
catalogued
for
easy
reference
and
withdrawal
the
image
of
her
pink
,
scented
stationery
and
the
unsloped
,
almost
printed
configurations
of
her
neat
,
studious
handwriting
with
which
she
invited
me
to
recall
our
summer
,
so
many
sentences
beginning
with
``
Remember
when
;
;

It
made
her
look
sweet
and
schoolgirlish
,
I
was
excited
to
be
with
her
,
but
I
did
not
know
how
to
express
it
.

We
would
write
to
one
another
and
make
a
definite
plan
.

But
though
I
boasted
and
gave
off
a
dapper
front
,
I
was
beneath
it
all
frightened
.

In
or
out
,
should
I
kiss
her
goodnight
?
?

When
in
one
letter
Jessica
informed
me
that
her
father
did
not
like
the
idea
of
her
going
out
alone
on
New
Year's
Eve
,
I
knew
for
a
moment
an
immense
relief
;
;

Her
optimism
gave
me
heart
.

I
wore
a
new
double-breasted
brown
worsted
suit
with
a
faint
herringbone
design
and
wide
lapels
like
a
devil's
ears
.

Times
Square
,
when
I
ascended
to
it
with
my
fellow
subway
travellers
(
all
dressed
as
if
for
a
huge
wedding
in
a
family
of
which
we
were
all
distant
members
)
,
was
nearly
impassable
,
the
sidewalks
swarming
with
celebrants
,
with
bundled
up
sailors
and
soldiers
already
hugging
their
girls
and
their
rationed
bottles
of
whiskey
.

I
looked
for
Jessica
to
materialize
out
of
the
clogging
,
curdling
crowd
and
,
as
the
time
passed
and
I
waited
,
a
fiend
came
to
life
beside
me
and
whispered
in
my
ear
:
How
was
I
planning
to
greet
Jessica
?
?

I
suddenly
thought
of
Mary
Jane
Brennan
,
the
way
her
pretty
eyes
could
flash
with
anger
,
her
quiet
competence
,
the
gentleness
and
sweetness
that
lay
just
beneath
the
surface
of
her
defenses
.

I
asked
.

``
I
was
full
of
booze
and
,
well
,
a
drunk
is
apt
to
do
anything
he
says
he'll
do
''
.

Don't
tell
me
about
drunks
.

``
Would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
I
were
,
Mary
Jane
''
?
?

``
I
wouldn't
have
gone
into
nursing
if
I
didn't
care
about
people
.

I
don't
blame
that
girl
for
breaking
her
engagement
with
you
.

You've
not
seemed
like
them
,
but
maybe
you
are
.

My
father's
a
policeman
and
makes
less
than
seven
thousand
dollars
a
year
.

There
was
no
money
for
tuition
,
for
clothes
,
for
all
the
things
you
apparently
take
for
granted
.

I
think
it's
a
good
deal
.

Her
eyes
became
bright
as
she
talked
about
her
father
and
mother
,
aunts
and
uncles
,
cousins
.

When
she
had
finished
I
said
:

I'll
bet
he
wouldn't
be
pleased
if
a
rumdum
like
me
were
to
ask
his
daughter
for
a
date
--
I
mean
,
after
I'm
out
of
the
hospital
,
a
month
or
so
from
now
''
.

He's
a
pretty
good
judge
of
character
,
Anderson
.

What
about
your
that
girl
you
were
going
to
kill
''
?
?

It
suddenly
seemed
very
important
to
me
that
Mary
Jane
Brennan
should
know
the
truth
about
me
--
that
I
was
not
the
confused
,
sick
,
irresponsible
person
she
believed
me
to
be
.

As
for
that
other
girl
,
let's
just
say
that
I
never
want
to
see
her
again
.

You
will
get
to
come
home
on
long
weekends
from
Hanover
,
won't
you
''
?
?

``
Do
you
like
to
dance

It
was
unlikely
that
any
girl
as
sharp
as
Mary
Jane
Brennan
would
believe
it
without
proof
.

No
one
,
not
even
the
producer
,
had
any
real
hope
of
getting
it
back
to
Broadway
.

But
because
it
was
a
suspense
gangster
story
of
the
Capone
era
,
many
of
us
felt
that
it
might
catch
on
for
a
run
in
Chicago
,
continue
as
a
road
company
,
and
eventually
become
a
movie
.

We
opened
on
Friday
and
closed
the
following
Monday
.

Then
later
I
had
quit
my
safe
,
secure
five-a-week
spot
on
a
network
soap
opera
to
take
a
part
in
this
play
.

I
knew
that
I'd
soon
be
back
working
as
an
orderly
at
the
hospital
or
as
a
counterman
at
Union
News
or
Schraffts
while
waiting
for
another
acting
job
to
open
.

``
All
right
''
,
I
said
.

I'm
calling
you
,
Mr.
Nelson
,
at
the
request
of
Mr.
Phillip
Wycoff
.

His
car
could
pick
you
up
at
your
hotel
at
twelve
''
.

``
Yes
,
of
course
,
Mr.
Nelson
''
.

I
started
to
say
something
else
appropriate
,
but
the
man
had
hung
up
.

``
You
Mr.
Nelson
''
?
?

He
asked
.

``
That's
right
''
.

I
was
giving
the
parked
cars
the
once-over
.

The
Oldsmobile
with
the
license
number
JYJ
114
was
in
stall
number
five
.

I
put
in
new
batteries
so
as
to
be
certain
I'd
have
plenty
of
power
and
on
my
way
out
walked
over
to
the
regular
parking
stalls
and
stood
looking
at
them
thoughtfully
.

The
attendant
waved
me
on
.

Your
leg
muscles
and
back
muscles
feel
weary
.

You're
conscious
of
the
fact
that
your
feet
hurt
,
that
the
city
pavements
are
hard
.

``
That
curb
parking
is
undependable
and
annoying
,
particularly
when
it
rains
''
,
he
said
.

Regulars
drive
out
their
own
cars
''
.

You
get
business
where
the
business
is
,
not
where
it
isn't
''
.

By
the
time
I'd
made
it
he
was
gone
.

I
turned
on
the
electric
bug
,
and
the
signal
came
in
loud
and
clear
.

I
stayed
half
a
block
behind
him
,
letting
lots
of
cars
keep
in
between
us
,
listening
to
the
steady
beep
beep
beep
.

After
a
while
the
signal
became
a
buzz
and
I
knew
he
was
behind
me
.

Moreover
,
I'd
have
lost
him
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
electronic
shadowing
device
.

I
noticed
that
he
was
in
Unit
12
and
that
he
had
registered
under
the
name
of
Oscar
L.
Palmer
and
wife
,
giving
a
San
Francisco
address
.

If
he
does
,
it's
still
better
than
an
even
chance
he
won't
notice
the
transposition
of
the
numbers
,
and
if
he
should
notice
it
,
the
thing
can
be
passed
off
as
an
honest
mistake
.

I
could
have
written
anything
.

``
That's
right
''
.

``
Your
wife
isn't
going
to
join
you
--
later
''
?
?

We
like
to
run
a
nice
quiet
place
''
.

``
Thank
you
''
,
I
told
her
.

not
like
the
cracker-box
construction
of
so
many
of
the
motel
units
that
have
stucco
all
over
the
outside
but
walls
that
are
thin
enough
so
you
can
hear
every
movement
of
the
people
in
the
adjoining
apartment
.

With
the
aid
of
that
I
could
hear
my
man
moving
around
,
heard
him
cough
a
couple
of
times
,
heard
the
toilet
flush
,
heard
the
sound
of
water
running
.

He
didn't
have
to
telephone
.

I
was
so
hungry
my
stomach
felt
all
lines
of
communication
had
been
severed
.

It's
one
thing
to
go
without
food
when
you're
occupied
with
some
work
or
when
you're
simply
postponing
a
meal
,
but
when
you're
dependent
on
someone
else
and
know
that
you
can't
eat
until
he's
bedded
down
for
the
night
,
hunger
can
be
a
gnawing
torture
.

I
got
in
the
car
,
drove
down
to
the
drive-in
and
ordered
a
couple
of
hamburgers
with
everything
included
,
a
cup
of
coffee
and
the
fastest
service
possible
.

``
You
really
in
a
hurry
,
Handsome
''
?
?

``
I'm
in
a
hurry
,
Beautiful
''
.

I
said
``
Darn
it
,
that's
the
automatic
signal
that
shows
when
the
ignition
key
is
on
.

``
No
''
,
I
said
.

``
How
much
overweight
is
she
''
?
?

``
Good
figures
should
be
kept
in
hand
''
,
she
said
,
and
walked
away
with
an
exaggerated
wiggle
.

When
I
switched
on
the
lights
for
her
to
come
and
get
the
check
,
I
had
the
exact
change
plus
a
dollar
tip
.

He
was
going
to
be
sensible
and
not
try
to
do
anything
rash
with
that
gun
pointed
at
him
.

Vince
.

The
white
Buick
hadn't
moved
away
yet
.

``
Remember
how
she
looked
when
Barney
held
the
door
for
her
?
?

Grosse
muttered
,
his
head
down
,
one
hand
playing
with
the
zipper
on
his
jacket
.

The
heavy
glass
didn't
break
,
but
the
top
flew
off
;
;

The
fat
man
didn't
answer
.

He
returned
the
menu
to
its
place
between
catchup
bottle
and
paper
napkin
dispenser
.

``
She
don't
know
nothing
about
them
cars
.

Grosse
tucked
the
gun
under
the
counter
.

``
You
get
that
kid
over
to
Rose's
house
''
.

``
You
and
Barney
get
her
over
to
Rose's
before
it
gets
too
light
.

After
Guardino's
left
,
we'll
dump
the
kid
somewhere
near
the
border
where
she
kin
get
home
.

``
What
am
I
going
to
do
with
her
all
day
?
?

Just
get
her
where
Guardino
won't
see
her
and
start
asking
questions
''
.

I
ain't
no
baby
sitter
''
.

``
You
don't
hafta
get
nasty
.

``
What
is
it
''
?
?

And
I
ain't
going
back
there
on
account
of
one
lousy
kid
''
.

Barney
was
not
really
frightening
.

Although
she
found
she
was
thirsty
,
she
was
about
to
refuse
(
never
,
never
take
candy
from
a
strange
man
)
when
she
saw
the
bottle
was
unopened
.

She
blew
her
nose
on
a
tissue
and
opened
the
coke
bottle
.

The
man
was
busy
doing
something
to
the
inside
of
the
door-frame
on
the
driver's
side
of
a
car
.

But
he
was
back
at
work
on
a
car
.

Her
heart
was
thumping
painfully
;
;

Her
mother
would
be
fast
asleep
curled
up
against
that
wonderful
,
big
,
safe
,
solid
shoulder
next
to
her
on
the
front
seat
.

He
inserted
the
car
key
in
the
lock
.

We're
going
''
.

You
go
.

The
big
car
sprang
away
from
the
curb
like
something
alive
.

Roberta
glanced
at
him
and
stopped
trembling
.

His
eyes
were
threaded
by
little
filaments
of
red
as
if
tiny
veins
had
burst
and
flooded
blood
into
them
.

Marty
smiled
at
Squire
pleasantly
and
said
,
``
There
was
a
cab
waiting
for
me
here
.

He
asked
,
keeping
his
voice
casual
.

The
seventeen
men
stood
and
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
longer
.

There
were
other
farmhouses
nearby
.

There
were
many
more
between
here
and
Jarrodsville
.

Telephone
poles
lined
the
road
.

They
were
staring
at
him
in
the
same
blank
and
menacing
way
that
the
men
outside
the
gate
had
stared
.

It
concerned
an
officer
who
had
been
disgraced
and
drummed
out
.

The
steady
roll
of
the
drums
had
sounded
behind
him
as
he
walked
between
the
endless
ranks
of
the
men
he
had
commanded
,
and
each
man
about-faced
and
turned
his
back
as
the
officer
approached
.

Now
the
dirt
highway
was
bordered
on
either
side
by
a
fairly
deep
drainage
ditch
,
too
broad
to
leap
over
unless
you
were
an
Olympic
star
.

It
was
the
station
wagon
that
had
passed
his
cab
on
the
road
,
the
station
wagon
that
had
been
parked
at
the
Burch
farm
.

There
was
nothing
he
could
do
except
jump
into
the
ditch
.

The
cars
,
with
their
load
of
howling
men
,
had
disappeared
in
the
distance
.

He
still
had
three
miles
to
go
.

He
could
not
go
through
the
fields
.

At
least
he
could
climb
up
on
the
fence
when
his
tormenters
roared
by
again
.

He
did
not
dare
climb
back
up
to
the
road
.

He
splashed
on
,
mud
sucking
at
his
feet
with
each
step
,
until
he
reached
the
end
of
the
drainage
ditch
and
the
beginning
of
the
fence
that
enclosed
the
farm
.

He
stood
,
panting
,
for
a
moment
.

The
fence
,
his
only
refuge
when
the
metal
death
came
roaring
at
him
,
was
made
of
rails
,
all
right
,
but
the
rails
were
protected
by
a
thick
screening
of
barbed
wire
that
would
rip
his
flesh
if
he
pressed
against
it
.

You
could
not
stand
on
dignity
when
you
were
soaked
and
muddied
and
your
life
was
at
stake
.

Probably
people
were
watching
him
from
the
porch
or
from
behind
the
windows
of
this
farmhouse
,
too
,
but
he
did
not
bother
to
look
.

The
fences
stretched
on
endlessly
.

And
then
he
heard
them
.

The
cars
must
have
had
their
gas
pedals
pushed
down
to
the
floor
boards
.

He
thought
the
fender
of
the
Plymouth
brushed
his
jacket
as
it
went
by
.

He
did
not
leave
the
middle
of
the
road
.

He
was
going
to
make
it
,
he
told
himself
.

``
Oh
,
no
,
not
again
''
,
he
said
aloud
.

There
was
a
new
sound
,
a
sound
as
piercing
as
the
Rebel
yell
,
yet
different
.

``
Get
in
''
,
Charley
Estes
said
brusquely
.

Rourke
was
talking
on
the
phone
when
he
came
back
.

He
listened
a
moment
and
then
said
,
``
Hold
it
''
.

I'll
be
there
''
.

Rourke
confirmed
the
appointment
over
the
phone
and
hung
up
.

''

``
Where
''
?
?

``
A
lady
.

That
is
,
maybe
not
too
much
of
a
lady
.

``
I
don't
know
whether
that
threatening
letter
of
hers
has
anything
to
do
with
this
situation
or
not
,
but
I
want
to
see
who
takes
the
call
''
.

``
This
deal
at
Las
Putas
Buenas
where
the
two
knife-men
jumped
you
''
,
said
Rourke
with
interest
,
``
that
sounds
like
it
was
set
up
with
malice
aforethought
by
the
luscious
Mrs.
Peralta
,
doesn't
it
''
?
?

A
single
automobile
was
parked
half-way
up
the
block
on
the
left-hand
side
.

He
turned
to
see
the
briefly-illumed
faces
of
two
men
in
the
parked
car
just
as
Rourke
said
,
``
It's
the
next
house
,
Mike
.

``
It
was
back
there
.

''

His
voice
was
chilling
and
cold
.

``
Did
you
see
the
car
parked
across
the
street
''
?
?

``
It
has
a
Beach
license
,
Tim
.

Unless
I'm
crazy
as
hell
,
they're
two
of
Painter's
dicks
.

Shayne
nodded
grimly
.

``
The
pair
whom
Petey
is
officially
commending
for
slapping
me
around
and
pulling
me
in
''
.

``
What
are
they
doing
here
''
?
?

``
A
stake-out
,
I
suppose
.

I'm
not
positive
,
Tim
.

You
drive
on
and
circle
back
and
pull
up
beside
them
parked
there
.

Make
them
show
their
hands
.

``
The
things
you
talk
me
into
,
Mike
.

The
reporter
nodded
as
he
moved
up
beside
him
at
the
bar
.

Shayne
told
the
bartender
,
``
Bourbon
and
water
''
,
and
Rourke
told
him
,
``
It's
those
two
,
all
right
.

Shayne
said
happily
,
``
I've
got
it
all
worked
out
,
Tim
.

Will
that
pay
for
a
pint
I
can
take
with
me
.

Shayne
turned
the
handle
and
jerked
the
door
open
before
either
of
the
men
were
quite
aware
of
his
presence
in
the
night
.

What
happened
with
you
''
?
?

He
glanced
up
in
time
to
see
Roberts
hurtling
down
on
him
from
above
,
literally
flying
through
the
air
,
his
bloody
face
twisted
.

Mickey
tried
to
flatten
against
the
banister
,
gripped
it
with
one
hand
,
but
Roberts'
full
weight
struck
him
at
that
moment
in
the
groin
.

He
gasped
for
air
and
the
impact
tore
his
hand
from
the
rail
.

He
made
himself
back
off
slowly
,
his
eyes
wary
on
Roberts
,
who
now
had
no
more
to
lose
than
he
.

``
Come
on
''
,
he
said
.

He
held
the
razor
well
out
to
one
side
.

``
Or
would
it
be
easier
if
I
put
my
hands
in
my
pockets
''
?
?

He
advanced
slowly
,
directly
,
giving
no
hint
of
a
feint
to
either
side
.

Mickey
backed
off
two
steps
,
forcing
him
to
come
on
again
.

Mickey
backed
off
again
and
Roberts
hesitated
,
then
came
along
.

This
was
going
to
be
it
now
,
any
second
,
and
what
he
had
to
remember
was
to
keep
his
eye
on
the
razor
,
no
matter
what
,
even
if
Roberts
should
feint
with
a
kick
to
the
groin
,
the
deadly
hand
was
his
exclusive
concern
.

He
hunched
his
left
shoulder
into
it
and
slashed
at
Roberts'
forearm
with
his
own
,
felt
the
blade
slide
off
his
sleeve
.

Before
Roberts
could
move
inside
to
cut
upward
toward
his
face
,
he
slammed
his
right
fist
into
Roberts'
belly
.

He
felt
it
rip
at
the
side
of
his
jacket
and
a
momentary
sting
under
his
left
ribs
.

When
he
charged
Mickey
was
ready
.

He
couldn't
feel
any
.

There's
no
way
to
take
him
in
now
and
keep
those
other
two
--
Wister
and
the
one
who
hired
the
two
of
them
--
from
finding
out
about
Roberts
and
lamming
out
.

He
went
to
the
room
he
had
rented
and
got
into
his
overcoat
.

It
snowed
softly
,
silently
,
an
undulating
interruption
of
his
vision
against
the
night
sky
.

Then
he
backed
out
and
swung
around
to
the
front
drive
.

He
went
into
the
hotel
and
searched
till
he
found
the
razor
.

It
snowed
continuously
,
but
quietly
,
evenly
.

When
he
reached
the
dip
in
the
woods
,
he
saw
that
already
the
earlier
ruts
were
barely
discernible
.

The
Jeep
fought
its
way
through
the
low
spot
and
got
onto
higher
ground
.

When
the
dust
settled
,
he
went
back
to
the
Jeep
and
carefully
worked
Roberts'
body
onto
his
shoulder
.

It
would
be
a
bad
place
to
die
.

It
was
a
bad
place
for
Roberts
to
wind
up
,
but
Roberts
had
asked
for
it
.

He
got
to
his
feet
and
threw
the
flashlight
beam
into
the
pit
.

It
wasn't
cold
enough
in
the
tunnel
to
preserve
the
body
intact
.

He
made
his
way
back
to
the
Jeep
.

It
landed
on
Roberts'
sprawled
right
thigh
,
poised
precariously
,
then
slid
off
to
the
ground
.

He
went
back
once
more
to
the
Jeep
and
started
the
short
drive
to
the
hotel
.

The
maid
answered
and
he
decided
Nancy
must
be
at
work
.

A
woman
named
Lisa
who
tells
nobody
anything
about
herself
.

On
the
highway
he
relaxed
and
enjoyed
the
drive
over
Lake
Pontchartrain
and
along
the
coast
.

The
courthouse
was
a
white-stucco
building
minus
the
customary
dome
.

The
sheriff's
swivel
chair
tilted
back
.

Pity
we
don't
know
more
about
him
.

It'll
be
a
tedious
job
,
but
if
you
want
to
try
it
,
the
old
newspaper
files
are
in
the
basement
here
in
the
county
supervisor's
office
''
.

``
Once
,
when
the
editor
was
just
out
of
the
hospital
from
a
gallstone
operation
,
Mrs.
Calhoun
and
the
mother
of
the
bride
went
out
to
his
house
and
fought
it
out
beside
his
bed
.

It
turned
out
that
she
also
sold
real
estate
,
cosmetics
,
and
hospital
insurance
.

I
remember
her
because
she
didn't
want
her
picture
in
the
paper
.

``
Now
how
in
hell
would
I
remember
that
''
?
?

Mr.
Ferrell
is
a
private
detective
,
Hirey
.

``
Sure
''
,
said
Hirey
.

It
won't
open
from
inside
.

Hirey
treats
himself
a
lot
better
than
we
do
prisoners
.

And
,
of
course
,
you
know
not
to
take
clippings
''
.

In
a
tour
around
the
stacks
,
he
found
that
the
earliest
volumes
began
on
the
left
and
progressed
clockwise
around
the
room
.

An
old
weakness
for
burrowing
in
records
rose
up
to
tempt
him
.

It
was
,
indeed
,
all
here
--
almost
a
century
.

He
pulled
it
over
,
climbed
up
,
and
lifted
out
the
big
volume
,
almost
losing
his
balance
from
the
weight
of
it
.

It
told
him
little
more
than
Mrs.
Calhoun
had
remembered
,
stating
that
it
had
been
a
small
,
modest
wedding
compared
to
some
of
the
others
.

Mr.
Black's
life
was
an
open
book
,
so
to
speak
,
from
his
birth
in
Jackson
,
Mississippi
,
through
his
basketball-playing
days
at
L.S.U.
and
his
attainment
of
a
B.A.
degree
,
which
had
presumably
prepared
him
for
his
career
as
district
sales
manager
for
Peerless
Business
Machines
.

Hank
was
beginning
to
feel
sharp
concern
for
Mr.
Black
.

The
item
said
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Black
had
moved
to
Jackson
,
his
home
town
--
so
the
lovely
Lisa
had
been
with
him
a
year
ago
.

He
glanced
at
his
watch
,
saw
it
was
only
seven
,
and
decided
to
indulge
his
weakness
now
.

In
the
middle
of
the
stock
market
crash
,
he
heard
a
slight
noise
in
the
outer
office
.

He
turned
around
,
saw
nothing
,
and
decided
it
must
be
a
mouse
.

It
clanged
shut
as
he
sprang
toward
it
.

No
,
they
could
kill
him
just
as
easy
right
now
.

``
Well
''
--
said
Mr.
Skyros
.

Someone
reasonably
trustworthy
.

And
Angie
would
hear
about
it
.

And
Angie
knew
--

``
Time
''
,
said
Angie
,
and
he
smiled
very
sweet
and
slow
at
Mr.
Skyros
.

``
Not
too
much
time
,
because
I'll
be
needing
some
more
myself
pretty
much
right
away
.

the
genial
smile
seemed
painted
on
his
face
.

Angie
knew
--
Speak
of
dangerous
information
!
!

Really
he
had
Mr.
Skyros
at
bay

Acourse
there's
this
deal
o'
Denny's
--
and
Jackie's
--
kinda
hangin'
fire
,
ain't
it
,
maybe
you've
been
kinda
worryin'
over
that
.

I
stay
in
business
so
long
because
I'm
careful
.

``
That's
a
long
while
''
,
said
Angie
.

I
mean
,
we
all
figured
--
I
guess
anybody'd
figure
--
Angie
''
--

If
Mr.
Skyros
had
dreamed
of
all
the
trouble
that
young
man
would
eventually
cause
--

Who
knew
,
Angie
might
not
last
long
.

``
Now
you
don't
want
to
go
talking
that
way
''
,
he
said
.

You
see
,
you
got
to
remember
,
we
all
got
schedules
,
like
any
business
!
!

``
I
appreciate
it
,
you
do
that
.

Sure
.

We
don't
none
of
us
want
no
trouble
.

``
Standard
deal
,
Mr.
Skyros
.

This
is
awkward
for
everybody
,
isn't
it
,
we
all
got
to
put
up
with
inconvenience
sometimes
.

He
got
out
of
there
in
a
hurry
,
brushing
past
another
man
in
the
door
,
mopping
his
brow
.

Grab
,
snatch
,
I
saw
that
first
!
!

This
kind
of
place

Not
when
she'd
waited
so
long
already
.

Escape
.

To
be
Katharine
Ross
,
and
work
in
a
nicer
shop
somewhere
,
at
a
little
more
money
so
she
could
have
prettier
clothes
,
and
learn
ladies'
manners
and
all
like
that
,
and
get
to
know
different
people
than
up
to
now
,
not
just
the
ones
like
her
here
,
with
foreign-sounding
names
,
the
ones
went
to
the
same
church
and
--
Different
place
,
different
job
,
different
people
,
she'd
be
all
different
too
.

Some
of
those
vaguely-imagined
new
,
different
people
.

``
Happened
to
be
in
the
hall
!
!

Drink
your
coffee
''
--

Maude
swooped
up
the
cup
and
hiked
up
her
top
hoop
as
if
about
to
take
off
with
a
racing
start
.

Ben
and
Lucien
have
gone
after
them
.

But
of
course
the
paterollers
won't
be
of
any
help
,
not
with
everything
so
upset
and
that
Yankee
cavalry
outfit
they
say
is
running
around
,
God
knows
where
''
.

But
then
the
so-called
coffee
was
bad
enough
at
best
,
cold
it
was
all
but
undrinkable
--
especially
that
cup
!
!

Rilly
or
Glendora
had
entered
her
room
while
she
slept
,
bringing
back
her
washed
clothes
.

And
he
certainly
couldn't
have
guessed
that
she
would
resist
his
demand
for
the
gold
or
that
she
was
not
the
yielding
--
yes
,
and
credible
fool
he
had
every
right
to
expect
.

Don't
question
,
Rev
had
said
,
don't
invite
danger
.

But
before
she
left
her
room
she
dug
into
her
big
moire
bag
,
took
out
the
envelope
holding
her
marriage
contract
and
the
wax
seal
had
been
broken
.

Rev
had
known
all
along
.

Rev
didn't
need
to
break
the
wax
seal
,
read
the
contract
and
find
out
.

``
Too
much
work
this
morning
,
Miss
Sarah
--
everybody
gone
like
that
''
--

``
Miss
Maude
.

Maude
?
?

In
the
kitchen
Glendora
was
despairingly
picking
chickens
.

Glendora
dropped
a
chicken
and
a
flurry
of
feathers
,
and
went
with
her
through
the
drizzle
,
to
the
storehouse
.

It
was
a
long
,
low
room
,
like
a
root
cellar
,
for
it
was
banked
up
with
soil
,
and
vines
had
run
rampant
over
that
,
too
.

They
wouldn't
go
hungry
,
not
yet
.

Maude
had
said
.

Maude
had
the
opportunity
to
take
the
bottle
of
opium
from
Sarah's
room
.

A
lighted
lamp
stood
on
the
table
that
dusky
,
drizzling
day
.

George
had
a
tack
hammer
.

A
rush
of
panic
caught
Sarah
.

As
she
reached
the
kitchen
door
the
answer
presented
itself
;
;

It
might
be
,
indeed
it
had
already
proved
to
be
a
marriage
without
love
,
but
it
was
marriage
.

So
she
couldn't
choose
Rev
as
a
confidant
;
;

I
didn't
think
there
was
any
reason
to
''
.

``
Maybe
there
isn't
.

``
You
think
Black's
the
one
we're
looking
for
''
?
?

``
I
know
''
.

You
don't
think
Gilborn
is
the
--
''
?
?

``
Gilborn
says
he
was
in
his
office
all
day
with
her
yesterday
.

``
Right
.

He
looked
at
his
watch
.

He
stopped
automatically
at
the
street
corners
,
waiting
for
the
traffic
lights
to
change
,
unheeding
of
other
people
,
his
coat
open
and
flapping
.

Mainly
of
what
Conrad
had
tried
to
make
him
believe
.

Yet
it
wasn't
so
.

Kitti
had
come
along
to
justify
everything
.

Not
once
,
in
the
time
that
he
had
known
her
,
had
he
ever
considered
the
possibility
,
not
once
,
not
for
one
one-thousandth
of
a
second
,
of
her
infidelity
.

Not
really
.

And
so
he
walked
,
aimless
again
.

Where
there
is
a
victim
,
there
is
a
killer
.

He
rose
from
the
chair
,
took
off
his
coat
.

If
anyone
had
asked
her
,
she
would
have
described
herself
only
as
nervous
and
worried
.

She
wondered
whether
Stanley
would
call
.

And
now
she
was
feeling
sick
,
both
from
concern
about
Stanley
and
hunger
.

The
dentist
last
night
,
for
instance
.

It
was
in
the
kitchen
,
as
she
was
watching
the
kettle
,
waiting
for
the
water
to
boil
,
that
he
had
grabbed
for
her
.

Her
mother
was
already
considerably
concerned
over
her
daughter's
future
.

For
Blanche
,
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
Stanley
would
propose
.

Stanley
had
filled
out
the
return
and
because
,
when
he
was
finished
,
it
was
close
to
the
lunch
hour
,
he
had
politely
asked
Kitti
to
join
him
,
never
expecting
her
to
accept
.

Those
ten
days
were
like
no
others
that
Blanche
had
known
.

Mostly
,
she
stayed
in
bed
.

``
Right
''
,
said
the
fingerprint
man
.

If
Rose
Mallory's
killer
acted
this
way
,
catching
up
with
him
was
going
to
be
a
cinch
.

We'd
know
him
by
his
stretch
pants
and
the
flowers
he'd
wear
twined
in
his
hair
.

Perhaps
if
Felix
had
first
come
upon
us
when
this
boy
was
not
cavorting
so
gaily
up
and
down
the
hall
outside
the
murdered
woman's
apartment
,
we
might
have
had
less
trouble
convincing
Felix
of
our
seriousness
.

He
had
retained
his
hat
and
his
horn
,
and
,
whatever
fun
might
still
be
going
,
he
was
ready
to
join
it
.

The
M.E.'s
boys
had
finished
their
on-the-spot
examination
and
the
body
had
been
removed
for
autopsy
.

You're
a
taxpayer
,
householder
,
landlord
.

You
have
your
paper
horn
clutched
in
your
big
,
craggy
fist
,
and
for
your
entrance
you
have
planned
a
noisy
,
colorful
and
exuberant
greeting
to
your
friends
and
tenants
.

Then
he
turns
back
to
you
.

We'd
seen
his
handiwork
out
in
the
back
yard
,
and
the
little
his
tenants
had
told
us
of
him
did
make
him
sound
a
little
special
.

He
,
of
course
,
must
have
been
equally
unprepared
for
what
confronted
him
,
but
,
nonetheless
,
I
did
find
his
reaction
startling
.

I
don't
remember
ever
seeing
teeth
that
were
quite
so
white
and
at
the
same
time
quite
so
emphatically
not
dentures
.

He
had
only
a
fringe
of
hair
and
he
wore
it
cropped
short
.

``
Felix
''
?
?

``
Me
,
the
happy
one
''
.

``
That
much
Latin
we
remember
''
,
Gibby
said
dryly
.

``
You
always
live
up
to
your
name
,
always
like
this
,
always
making
happy
''
?
?

``
The
world
is
full
of
blokes
who
put
their
hearts
into
making
the
tragic
scene
.

Felix
is
all
there
is
''
.

We
are
Assistant
District
Attorneys
.

This
gentleman
is
a
police
officer
.

He
is
a
fingerprint
specialist
.

Come
right
along
.

``
That
important
''
?
?

Felix
asked
.

Obligingly
Gibby
lowered
his
voice
.

That
was
almost
forty
years
ago
''
.

You
may
think
we
didn't
need
Nancy
and
Jean
,
but
you
always
get
what
you
can
when
you
can
,
and
we
had
no
guarantee
that
a
fingerprint
record
on
them
couldn't
be
useful
before
we
were
through
with
this
case
.

The
killer
,
if
in
our
present
group
,
would
certainly
be
interested
in
knowing
that
much
,
and
even
though
with
the
fingerprint
evidence
what
it
was
I
could
see
no
way
he
could
use
this
bit
of
information
to
improve
on
his
situation
,
there
might
always
be
some
way
.

Felix
took
us
into
his
studio
.

These
shapes
might
have
been
mad
,
but
there
was
no
telling
.

They
were
all
completely
shrouded
.

Hub
was
sitting
in
a
chair
that
blocked
the
hall
door
.

He
was
dozing
,
perhaps
the
only
sleep
he'd
gotten
.

Nothing
new
.

Hub
picked
up
the
telephone
.

``
Some
better
.

He
had
little
time
to
himself
,
anyway
.

Thornburg
arrived
with
the
writers
.

They
had
spent
the
morning
revising
the
act
,
eliminating
all
the
gay
songs
,
patter
and
dancing
with
a
view
of
the
best
public
relations
.

Raymond
Fox
reported
that
the
orchestra
had
hastily
rehearsed
``
Cradle
Song
''
in
case
it
was
needed
.

El
Dorado
was
surrounded
by
a
mob
.

Backstage
was
tomblike
by
contrast
.

Bake
was
waiting
to
report
that
Lou
DuVol
had
been
sobered
up
to
the
point
where
he
could
function
efficiently
.

Skolman
isn't
going
to
like
it
much
,
though
,
giving
away
what
he
should
be
selling
''
.

However
,
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
screen
the
mob
outside
,
even
if
Bonner
had
manpower
available
for
the
purpose
.

``
No
longer
than
yours
.

Andy
crumbled
the
script
in
his
fist
.

But
Bonner
departed
,
still
full
of
ill
will
.

he
had
to
cling
to
routine
,
tested
procedures
.

To
act
otherwise
would
be
to
admit
his
helplessness
.

But
,
admit
or
not
,
Bonner
was
helpless
.

``
The
sweaty
bastard's
probably
halfway
to
Peru
with
our
money
by
now
''
.

Thornburg
popped
in
to
advise
,
``
Andy
,
Skolman's
sending
up
smoke
signals
.

``
What's
he
complaining
about
''
?
?

We
got
a
bunch
of
sippers
out
there
tonight
.

There's
a
couple
of
call-backs
I
can
work
on
''
.

The
result
had
nothing
of
the
polish
,
pace
or
cohesion
of
the
previous
night
.

Here's
where
luck
would
normally
step
in
.

Eliminating
the
patter
and
the
upbeat
numbers
left
little
but
blues
and
other
songs
of
equal
melancholy
.

the
evening
was
still
not
beyond
salvaging
,
not
as
a
show
but
for
him
as
a
person
.

Rocco
Vecchio
--
a
perspiring
,
haggard
Vecchio
--
was
standing
there
,
flanked
by
two
men
in
the
uniforms
of
armored
transport
guards
.

He
drew
a
deep
breath
.

He
sensed
rather
than
heard
the
gasp
that
swept
across
the
audience
.

This
particular
song
at
this
particular
time
could
only
be
interpreted
as
the
ultimate
in
bad
taste
,
callous
exploitation
beyond
the
bounds
of
decency
.

''

He
wondered
if
the
audience
would
let
him
finish
.

The
money's
here
,
all
of
it
''
.

``
Did
you
hear
them
?
?

Do
you
know
what
they
think
of
me
''
?
?

``
Who
needs
them
''
?
?

Nothing
broken
that
can't
be
mended
''
.

The
words
were
hollow
.

He
clutched
that
knowledge
to
him
as
he
returned
to
his
dressing
room
.

the
place
had
the
air
of
a
morgue
.

Just
don't
tell
Ferguson
that
crazy
opinion
of
yours
''
.

``
Why
not
''
?
?

under
the
scraggly
brows
the
pale
old
eyes
burned
with
a
bitter
memory
.

``
It's
the
truth
''
.

Rossi
and
Ferguson
have
been
across
the
street
,
talking
to
the
kid
.

``
The
trouble
with
you
''
,
old
man
Arthur
began
,
and
then
checked
himself
.

The
old
man
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
sunlight
.

``
Now
they've
gone
,
they
didn't
come
back
,
and
they
didn't
arrest
that
Dronk
boy
''
.

``
Why
on
earth
did
I
send
him
off
to
work
?
?

``
I
think
you
had
better
come
home
''
.

``
Mae
,
we're
so
busy
.

I'm
all
alone
and
certain
things
are
going
on
that
look
very
ominous
.

They'll
they'll
think
I
did
something
''
.

the
teeth
that
shone
into
the
phone
were
like
a
shark's
.

I'd
think
that
you
even
more
than
I
would
be
wondering
what
they're
up
to
.

``
What
''
?
?

Deliberately
,
she
ignored
the
yelp
.

He
rose
from
his
chair
.

her
motives
were
too
blatant
.

She
wanted
him
to
get
into
trouble
.

And
he
knew
in
that
moment
,
with
a
cold
sinking
of
despair
,
a
dying
of
old
hopes
,
that
Mae
had
spread
some
kind
of
word
there
among
the
neighbors
.

Though
his
inner
thoughts
cringed
at
it
,
he
forced
himself
to
think
back
,
recreating
the
scene
in
which
Mae
claimed
to
have
caught
him
molesting
the
child
.

A
second
scene
flashed
before
his
mind
,
the
interior
of
the
garage
at
the
new
house
and
the
young
Bartlett
girl
turning
startled
to
meet
him
,
the
dim
dark
and
the
sudden
confusion
and
fear
and
then
the
brightness
as
Mae
had
clicked
on
the
light
.

Mae
was
his
wife
.

She
was
married
to
him
for
better
or
for
worse
.

Cooper
was
beside
his
car
,
on
the
curb
at
the
right
,
just
standing
there
morosely
;
;

he
didn't
even
look
up
.

He
could
tell
them
his
fears
of
being
involved
,
he
could
explain
what
had
happened
in
the
old
neighborhood
and
how
Mae
had
misunderstood
and
how
she
had
held
it
over
him
--
the
scene
was
complete
in
his
mind
at
the
moment
,
even
to
his
own
jerkings
and
snivelings
,
and
Ferguson's
silent
patience
.

Sure
,
they're
giving
up
hope
.

Hand
in
hand
with
hope
went
things
like
terror
and
apprehension
.

Good-bye
.

``
Didn't
you
have
an
old
pair
of
painting
overalls
in
the
garage
?
?

Wait
a
minute
.

I'm
sure
they
were
in
the
garage
up
until
a
couple
of
days
ago
.

Or
even
yesterday
.

Put
down
the
cup
of
coffee
.

More
like
this
,
maybe
''
?
?

The
twenty-three
(
or
twenty-two
with
the
Paynes
themselves
omitted
)
provided
merely
a
place
to
start
,
and
their
identification
was
the
barest
of
starts
.

Of
course
he's
in

The
King
Arthur
was
less
expensive
than
the
Dumont
.

The
King
Arthur
had
fifty-four
overnighters
,
again
counting
rooms
rather
than
people
.

Or
long
fat
suitcase
,
for
that
matter
?
?

But
nothing
,
it
appeared
,
long
enough
to
attract
attention
.

Cases
,
say
,
for
musical
instruments
?
?

Anything
at
all
strange
?
?

Well
,
a
man
had
tried
,
at
the
King
Arthur
,
to
register
with
an
ocelot
.

As
reports
dribbled
in
,
William
Weigand
tossed
them
into
the
centrifuge
which
had
become
his
head
.

Sort
out
the
next
move
.

They
had
been
with
Payne
when
he
was
shot
,
could
not
therefore
have
shot
him
from
above
.

Consider
him
seriously
,
therefore
?
?

Willings
would
ambush
,
certainly
;
;

Willings
was
,
presumably
,
a
better
than
average
shot
.

Nobody
in
his
right
mind
punishes
a
quarter-century-old
dereliction
.

She
might
,
conceivably
,
have
brought
one
in
in
a
large-enough
suitcase
.

call
it
retarded
.

He
also
reminded
himself
that
he
had
an
unusual
number
of
possibilities
.

Opportunity
was
obvious
.

``
Right
''
?
?

Stilts
and
Shadow
,
on
Pam's
bed
,
appeared
to
be
one
cat
--
rather
large
,
as
Siamese
cats
go
,
and
,
to
be
sure
,
having
two
heads
and
two
tails
.

But
at
this
the
one
too-large
cat
suddenly
became
two
cats
,
stretching
.

Stilts
,
a
more
direct
cat
,
leaped
from
the
bed
and
trotted
briskly
toward
the
kitchen
.

Shadow
looked
surprised
,
wailed
,
and
trotted
after
her
.

Pam
found
she
had
no
answers
;
;

The
poor
,
unlucky
--

Pam
realized
,
to
her
surprise
,
that
she
had
been
almost
dozing
.

Don't
pretend
.

Even
with
words
coming
too
fast
,
they
came
on
the
music
of
the
voice
.

``
Call
this
a
cry
for
help
''
,
Faith
Constable
said
.

``
That
damn
door
''
,
said
the
police
chief
.

``
If
there
was
collusion
between
an
outside
murderer
and
a
member
of
the
household
it
would
be
an
elementary
precaution
to
check
on
the
door
later
.

``
Don't
forget
,
there
was
the
hope
it
would
pass
for
a
natural
death
''
,
Pauling
reminded
him
.

And
a
pane
of
glass
isn't
hard
to
''
--

I
was
hoping
I'd
hear
from
you
today
''
.

Scrapings
from
the
bed
linen
identical
with
the
lint
and
thread
found
in
the
nasal
and
oral
cavities
.

Trachea
clear
of
mucus
and
foreign
objects
.

Brain
examined
for
thrombosis
,
clot
or
hemorrhage
.

Oh
,
the
time
of
death
.

``
So
there
it
is
''
,
he
said
.

He
had
to
look
for
other
prospects
,
other
motives
until
more
conclusive
evidence
pointing
to
Johnston
came
to
light
.

If
Arthur
Williams
was
involved
in
the
fraud
or
the
murder
,
then
he
too
had
another
identity
.

Pauling
looked
doubtful
.

Madden
knew
that
he
could
be
completely
wrong
about
all
this
,
but
also
knew
that
he
would
go
right
on
disliking
Garth
.

At
the
time
the
will
was
drawn
Mr.
Hohlbein
mentioned
to
me
how
mentally
alert
she
seemed
for
her
age
,
knowing
just
what
changes
she
wanted
made
and
so
forth
''
.

``
Mr.
Hohlbein
and
I
have
noticed
some
lapses
since
,
though
.

She'd
have
consulted
us
,
you
see
.

A
splendid
vote
of
confidence
in
Thayer
,
Madden
reflected
.

to
Brian
Thayer
,
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
dollars
;
;

Mrs.
Meeker
hadn't
got
around
to
taking
care
of
that
.

``
Sometimes
we'd
have
trouble
persuading
her
to
make
tax-exempt
charitable
contributions
,
and
I've
known
her
to
quarrel
with
a
plumber
over
a
bill
for
fixing
a
faucet
;
;

the
next
moment
she'd
put
another
half
million
into
the
scholarship
fund
or
thirty
thousand
into
something
as
impractical
as
this
unfortunate
Johnston
affair
.

There
was
no
telling
how
she'd
react
to
spending
money
''
.

His
expenses
ran
another
four
or
five
thousand
.

He
would
offer
no
theory
to
account
for
her
murder
.

No
doubt
Mrs.
Meeker
had
snubbed
him
many
a
time
and
he
felt
no
grief
over
her
passing
.

The
inspector
knew
as
he
left
that
this
was
wishful
thinking
.

Airy
and
bright
,
the
apartment
was
furnished
with
good
modern
furniture
,
rugs
,
and
draperies
.

In
Dunston
the
rent
would
run
close
to
two
hundred
a
month
;
;

A
newspaper
open
at
stock-market
reports
lay
on
one
of
them
.

Thayer
folded
it
up
and
offered
a
drink
.

Where
is
he
''
?
?

``
Phil
,
for
God's
sake
,
go
away
.

``
Why
,
I'm
not
fit
to
touch
the
hem
of
her
garment
''
.

It's
not
about
you
or
Midge
.

I
have
some
security
information
about
the
prime
minister
''
.

``
I'm
not
pulling
your
leg
.

Will
you
call
that
captain
''
?
?

``
No
use
,
he
won't
come
''
.

Now
will
you
get
him
''
?
?

Mahzeer's
the
ambassador
''
.

``
Where
are
they
''
?
?

Look
,
old
man
,
you
can't
go
up
.

They
won't
even
let
you
in
the
front
door
.

So
why
don't
you
be
a
good
boy
and
''
--

If
you
want
to
spend
another
day
in
the
State
Department
--
another
day
--
you
get
in
there
and
tell
that
captain
what
I
told
you
''
.

He
bit
out
the
words
.

I
was
just
going
.

``
I
want
Captain
Docherty
''
.

He
spotted
Docherty
coming
out
of
a
room
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
and
called
to
him
.

it
was
hideously
embarrassing
--
``
not
to
let
the
prime
minister
be
alone
with
Mahzeer
''
.

Griffith
looked
half-crocked
to
the
captain
;
;

``
Why
not
''
?
?

he
wasn't
going
to
allow
himself
to
be
led
meekly
to
the
slaughter
.

``
Would
you
mind
sending
him
up
here
?
?

But
Hoag
had
not
stayed
on
the
front
steps
when
Griffith
disappeared
into
the
building
.

He
would
have
to
do
something
on
his
own
.

the
scene
looked
like
a
Christmas
card
.

On
the
third
floor
one
of
the
two
windows
was
lighted
;
;

He
walked
rapidly
along
the
buildings
scanning
their
facades
:
one
was
a
club
--
that
was
out
;
;

The
names
on
the
mailboxes
meant
nothing
to
him
.

He
peered
in
the
boxes
themselves
;
;

The
occupants
of
Apartment
Number
3
were
probably
away
for
a
few
days
,
and
not
likely
to
return
on
a
Friday
.

he
noted
with
a
thrill
of
fear
that
the
door
moved
under
his
touch
.

His
thoughts
were
scattered
by
the
sharp
report
of
a
rifle
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
.

He
was
dead
before
his
body
made
contact
with
the
floor
.

Gun
went
to
the
connecting
door
,
which
was
open
,
and
stood
at
attention
while
Orville
Torrence
Killpath
,
in
full
uniform
,
finished
combing
his
hair
.

The
lieutenant
eyed
Gun's
reflection
in
the
mirror
over
the
washbowl
and
then
glanced
back
at
his
own
face
,
moving
the
comb
methodically
around
his
head
.

But
leave
me
alone
.

``
Running
in
,
running
out
.

He
rocked
back
in
the
chair
,
knee
locked
against
stomach
,
his
beady
eyes
fixed
on
Matson
.

He
was
silent
again
,
possibly
listening
to
the
sounds
in
the
squadroom
.

Gun
knew
that
nothing
but
aces
back
to
back
would
give
the
lieutenant
an
ulcer
and
a
smile
at
the
same
time
.

``
Now
,
now
,
you're
just
guessing
,
Sergeant
''
.

He
smiled
thinly
,
savoring
his
joke
.

``
He
let
a
patrolman
take
over
the
duties
of
the
station
keeper
.

``
That's
not
taking
one's
command
with
a
responsible
attitude
,
Matson
''
.

But
stupidity
was
no
consolation
when
it
had
rank
.

``
I
was
out
in
the
district
,
sir
''
.

He
stretched
a
pale
hand
out
to
the
scattered
papers
on
his
desk
.

He
stared
at
the
report
in
Killpath's
hand
,
sure
it
was
written
by
Accacia
--
just
as
sure
as
if
he'd
submitted
it
in
his
scrawled
longhand
.

``
I
didn't
think
Accacia
knew
so
many
big
words
,
Lieutenant
''
.

Killpath
licked
his
lips
.

I
don't
think
his
diligence
mitigates
your
negligence
,
Matson
''
.

``
Negligence
,
hell
''
!
!

``
Sir
.

Gun
stiffened
,
his
hands
balling
into
fists
at
his
sides
.

``
Morning
,
Lieutenant
Rinker
''
.

He
stood
up
,
cocked
his
head
and
eyed
Gun
coldly
.

It
had
come
as
no
great
surprise
to
Matson
that
the
hot
water
in
the
showers
didn't
work
,
that
Loren
Severe
had
thrown
up
all
over
the
stairs
,
or
that
some
thieving
bastard
of
a
cop
had
walked
off
with
his
cigarettes
.

Mr.
Phillips
took
a
razor
to
Gonzalez
,
Prop.
,
but
left
the
promise
that
Spanish
would
be
understood
because
he
thought
it
meant
that
Spanish
clientele
would
be
welcome
.

Language
was
no
problem
anyway
;
;

Mr.
Phillips
had
only
to
signal
from
his
doorway
to
summon
aid
from
the
ubiquitous
bilingual
children
who
played
on
the
sidewalks
of
Mission
Street
.

You
can't
tell
a
customer
how
much
it's
going
to
cost
him
to
refinance
his
payments
before
he
even
signs
for
a
loan
on
the
money
down
!
!

A
time
plan
is
a
mere
convenience
,
you
understand
,
and
when
''
--
He
interrupted
himself
,
smiling
.

``
I
put
her
in
lamps
.

``
She
says
she
has
to
finish
a
story
''
.

``
I
asked
her
why
she
couldn't
do
it
tomorrow
,
but
it
seems
the
muse
is
working
good
tonight
and
she's
afraid
to
let
it
go
''
.

His
name
was
George
Needham
and
he
,
too
,
had
come
from
a
good
family
.

All
this
went
through
Casey's
mind
in
the
first
instant
,
but
what
held
his
interest
was
the
fact
that
these
two
should
be
together
at
all
.

She
had
grown
up
with
young
Jenkins
,
and
he
had
heard
that
they
had
been
at
the
point
of
getting
married
at
least
twice
.

He
wanted
to
ask
her
about
Jenkins
now
,
but
he
knew
he
couldn't
do
so
in
Needham's
presence
.

``
Of
course
not
''
.

``
I'll
get
my
references
in
order
''
,
Needham
said
,
and
though
he
spoke
with
a
smile
,
Casey
somehow
got
the
idea
that
he
was
not
particularly
amused
.

For
another
second
or
two
he
gave
in
to
the
annoyance
that
was
directed
at
himself
;
;

It
no
longer
mattered
that
Burton
had
outsmarted
him
.

How
can
I
find
him
?
?

There
was
no
answer
to
this
and
he
began
to
pace
back
and
forth
across
the
room
,
his
imagination
out
of
control
.

He
thought
of
other
possibilities
,
none
of
them
satisfactory
,
and
finally
he
began
to
think
,
to
wonder
if
there
was
some
way
he
could
reach
Burton
.

Casey
heard
the
voice
distinctly
and
he
knew
who
it
was
,
but
it
took
him
a
while
to
make
the
mental
readjustment
and
control
the
disturbance
inside
his
head
.

``
I
was
hired
to
take
a
picture
.

He
dialed
it
and
listened
to
it
ring
ten
times
before
he
hung
up
.

Each
time
he
got
the
same
answer
and
in
the
end
he
gave
up
.

So
what
?
?

He
considered
opening
a
can
of
beer
but
vetoed
that
idea
too
.

Finally
he
went
into
the
bedroom
and
sat
down
to
take
off
his
shoes
.

You
don't
know
me
but
I
know
you
.

Casey
heard
the
click
of
the
distant
receiver
before
he
could
open
his
mouth
,
and
it
took
him
no
more
than
three
seconds
to
make
his
decision
.

He
was
in
his
car
with
his
camera
and
equipment
bag
in
less
than
two
minutes
,
and
it
took
him
only
three
more
to
reach
the
corner
,
a
block
from
Columbus
Avenue
.

Poet
nodded
,
swung
below
and
a
moment
later
emerged
from
the
forward
hatch
where
he
picked
up
the
anchor
.

The
rock
and
roll
music
coming
from
the
radio
station
suddenly
faded
as
the
boat
coasted
into
the
null
on
the
Aj
.

Poet
came
up
from
below
,
wearing
new
bathing
trunks
.

There
had
been
tension
in
the
plane
during
the
silent
descent
;
;

``
Hydraulic
''
?
?

Another
moment
and
they
were
out
of
sight
,
leaving
behind
only
a
string
of
bubbles
as
a
clue
to
their
whereabouts
.

If
Elaine's
uncle
had
stuck
to
this
desire
for
aloneness
,
he
probably
would
still
be
alive
.

That
was
a
hell
of
a
note
,
he
thought
.

The
fisherman
was
right
in
the
middle
of
the
Deep
.

Someday
,
geologists
had
warned
,
the
land
on
both
sides
of
these
deeps
would
fall
into
the
ocean
and
no
more
La
Jolla
or
Redondo
Beach
.

Why
,
he
wondered
,
had
Elaine
wanted
him
along
on
this
trip
?
?

He
sat
up
and
watched
as
they
pulled
themselves
over
the
stern
.

``
We're
right
on
the
edge
of
the
Deep
''
,
Elaine
said
.

Pulling
off
her
face
mask
,
she
carefully
placed
the
spear
gun
across
the
stern
,
then
lifted
her
wet
hair
from
her
back
and
squeezed
out
the
water
.

``
Which
is
a
break
as
the
area
to
search
is
less
than
a
square
mile
''
,
she
added
as
she
swung
her
legs
over
the
transom
.

``
Any
news
''
?
?

His
face
was
still
creased
in
pain
as
he
studied
the
underside
of
his
arm
.

The
sudden
silence
was
too
silent
.

Elaine
recovered
first
,
so
quickly
that
Nick
thought
he
might
have
imagined
her
sudden
reaction
.

``
I'll
get
some
ointment
''
.

Springing
like
a
cat
,
he
leaped
back
,
swooped
up
the
spring
gun
and
,
whirling
,
pointed
it
toward
the
cabin
.

The
moment
the
sea
closed
over
Nick
,
some
atavistic
sense
warned
him
that
he
would
survive
in
this
alien
element
only
if
he
did
not
panic
.

The
rubber
and
glass
face
mask
slipped
from
Poet's
forehead
,
bounced
painlessly
off
Nick's
chin
,
then
disappeared
.

Suddenly
Poet
stopped
struggling
and
the
two
of
them
hung
suspended
in
the
water
,
not
rising
,
not
sinking
.

A
sharp
pain
lanced
across
Nick's
chest
and
a
bubble
of
air
escaped
from
his
tortured
lungs
,
joining
dozens
of
others
that
sailed
lazily
toward
the
surface
like
helium
balloons
rising
into
the
sky
.

The
air
hose
was
free
!
!

At
once
the
excruciating
pain
in
his
chest
stopped
and
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
,
wild
exultation
.

As
if
this
was
a
signal
,
Poet
abruptly
began
to
thrash
the
water
and
the
quick
movement
slowly
made
them
sink
through
the
water
.

You're
not
only
young
but
well
,
you
don't
even
look
like
a
police
officer
.

A
runt
with
narrow
shoulders
and
that
brush
haircut
hell
,
you'd
pass
for
a
juvenile
delinquent
of
the
hotrod
set
.

Also
,
it's
far
too
early
in
the
day
for
corny
lines
like
the
bigger
they
come
You've
had
your
gassy
lecture
,
let's
get
to
work
.

Comfortably
fixed
.

``
Okay
,
what
happened
''
?
?

Tim
come
with
the
migratory
workers
that
follow
the
crops
up
from
the
South
last
year
,
but
Tim
and
his
wife
settled
here
.

''

``
Julia
asks
me
to
come
out
at
once
.

Don't
know
why
the
County
had
to
send
anybody
up
here
.

Told
them
I
can
handle
this
''
.

``
Who's
your
witness
''
?
?

Probably
the
last
of
the
original
Island
Indians
.

There's
no
doubt
this
Tim
sneaked
back
and
killed
Mrs.
Buck
.

Pulling
back
the
sheet
,
I
examined
the
bruises
around
Julia
Buck's
once
slender
throat
.

I
told
him
,
``
I
want
to
go
see
the
Buck
house
''
.

``
Yeah
,
it's
a
real
load
''
,
I
told
him
,
looking
up
the
street
at
my
battered
Ford
.

There
was
a
garage
and
a
modern
barn
in
the
rear
,
all
of
it
standing
between
two
large
flat
fields
planted
in
early
potatoes
.

Nellie
Harris
wasn't
old
,
she
was
ancient
--
a
tiny
shriveled
woman
with
a
face
like
a
tan
prune
.

``
Probably
wages
.

Miss
Julia
was
a
hard
woman
with
a
dollar
.

But
then
I
wasn't
her
social
secretary
''
.

They
had
a
son
--
killed
in
the
war
''
.

I
asked
.

``
Well
,
for
this
week
,
but
they
wasn't
due
'till
Saturday
.

Even
if
he
angry
,
Tim
wouldn't
hurt
a
woman
.

I
asked
.

``
Got
us
an
old
station
wagon
.

I
stood
there
,
staring
at
her
for
a
moment
--
thinking
mostly
of
her
beauty
and
her
poverty
.

I
had
a
bowl
of
decent
chowder
,
phoned
the
Doc
and
he
said
he'd
leave
the
death
statements
with
his
girl
--
in
a
half
hour
.

He
said
,
``
You
bet
.

She
was
'
hiding
'
on
the
floor
of
the
back
seat
,
the
soft
curves
of
her
back
and
hips
--
rousing
lines
.

She
puffed
on
the
cigarette
slowly
,
sitting
slumped
against
the
back
seat
;
;

``
Why
not
?
?

To
the
hotel
people
,
you'll
just
be
an
innocent
tourist
who
happens
to
ask
for
that
particular
suite
''
.

``
Still
,
they
may
not
want
to
rent
it
''
.

Soak
up
local
color
.

He
spoke
softly
.

Diana
Beauclerk
was
a
second-rate
actress
living
in
New
York
.

Two
weeks
ago
she
had
gone
west
to
Pearson
City
.

At
the
time
of
her
divorce
Forbes
had
promised
to
pay
her
a
lump
sum
in
lieu
of
further
alimony
if
she
remarried
.

According
to
Stacy
,
she
told
him
she
was
planning
to
remarry
and
she
wanted
him
to
ask
Forbes
for
the
lump
sum
.

Stacy
said
he
left
her
suite
at
nine
forty-five
p.m.
.

No
other
visitor
inquired
for
her
that
evening
.

When
Alec
finished
reading
he
was
sure
that
either
Forbes
or
Stacy
had
killed
Diana
Beauclerk
.

``
Anybody
with
a
contagious
disease
been
in
there
''
?
?

``
No
''
!
!

``
Suppose
you
tell
me
the
real
reason
''
,
he
drawled
.

``
Front
!
!

The
blue
rug
was
suspiciously
bright
and
new
.

Alone
,
Alec
examined
the
doors
.

They
used
pink
,
tan
,
or
cream
powder
.

In
the
darkness
he
could
see
the
rosy
reflection
of
the
neon
sign
on
the
wall
opposite
the
window
.

There
was
no
sound
and
apparently
no
movement
in
the
room
except
the
noiseless
pulsation
of
the
red
light
on
the
wall
.

He
lay
still
,
listening
to
the
silence
,
watching
the
light
.

Somewhere
in
the
city
a
big
clock
sounded
twelve
solemn
notes
--
midnight
.

According
to
the
medical
examiner
she
was
shot
between
eleven
p.m.
and
one
a.m.
.

Alec
heard
a
faint
sound
.

For
the
sound
was
inside
the
room
.

A
monstrous
shadow
fell
across
the
illuminated
wall
,
distorted
and
indefinable
.

Something
hard
grazed
his
knuckles
.

Rough
cloth
rasped
his
fist
.

Nothing
happened
.

Again
he
groped
for
the
light
switch
.

He
had
a
short
,
heavy
,
powerful
body
.

His
eyes
were
dazed
.

``
Did
you
kill
Diana
Beauclerk
''
?
?

But
you
realize
,
I
am
sure
,
how
much
old
deeds
incite
to
new
ones
,
and
you
must
forgive
me
if
I
tell
you
first
of
the
old
ones
.

``
Sister
''
,
said
he
``
do
you
think
people
who
commit
suicide
go
to
heaven
''
?
?

And
she
answered
,
``
I
don't
know
,
but
I
hope
you'll
never
do
such
a
thing
''
.

What
has
this
to
do
with
the
present
?
?

Red
and
Handley
,
God
help
them
,
knew
the
old
Dogtown
lore
;
;

and
I
knew
they
knew
it
,
for
I'd
told
them
a
lot
of
it
.

You
know
the
facts
;
;

they
are
set
forth
in
your
own
newspapers
.

yesterday
morning
.

And
my
point
in
this
sad
story
is
the
spirit
of
the
matter
.

Now
,
Dogtown
is
one
of
those
places
that
creeps
into
the
marrow
as
worms
get
into
old
wood
,
under
the
veneer
.

In
fact
,
all
the
folk
who
lived
on
the
back
of
Cape
Ann
,
they
are
not
just
like
others
.

There's
a
different
hall-mark
on
them
.

but
now
it's
the
most
lost
and
tortured
place
in
the
world
.

It
is
now
a
sweep
of
boulders
and
ledges
,
with
oak
,
walnut
and
sumac
creeping
across
the
common
,
and
everywhere
the
ruins
and
the
long
,
long
shadows
.

They
married
cousins
,
Anta
and
Freya
Norberg
.

The
quarrel
ended
in
a
ridiculous
draw
,
but
I
must
tell
you
about
it
.

What's
that
?
?

No
,
I
don't
hold
with
those
who
live
entirely
among
dead
things
.

He
is
the
sort
who
,
with
an
appraising
eye
,
would
cross
the
street
to
help
a
strange
woman
on
to
a
bus
and
then
pinch
her
.

A
real
gentleman
,
I
feel
,
would
do
neither
.

And
later
in
the
same
week
they
both
came
together
to
examine
the
register
.

Red
always
was
morose
,
yet
that
day
the
dapper
Handley
was
the
louder
of
the
two
.

But
for
my
presence
,
they
would
have
been
at
each
others'
throats
.

Both
men
knew
it
was
in
the
Norberg
family
holdings
,
but
to
which
of
the
cousins
did
it
belong
,
Anta
or
Freya
?
?

After
the
usual
Honorable
Sirs
,
it
went
on
to
say
that
there
had
been
set
off
to
the
widow
one
full
third
part
of
the
real
estate
of
the
deceased
Salu
Norberg
,
one
lower
room
,
on
the
Western
side
,
privileges
to
the
well
and
bake-oven
and
to
one
third
of
the
cellar
(
I
can
show
you
the
cellar
when
we
go
up
)
,
also
one
Cow
Right
,
and
lastly
they
set
off
to
the
widow
her
own
land
that
she
brought
with
her
as
dower
,
namely
the
Beech
Pasture
.

That
battle
scene
,
ridiculous
as
it
was
,
remained
in
my
mind
.

Not
that
I
intentionally
go
unperceived
,
but
the
boulders
up
there
are
very
high
and
I
am
a
small
woman
.

I
suppose
Handley
knew
it
.

One
month
ago
,
on
the
20th
of
October
,
was
the
opening
of
the
gunning
season
in
Massachusetts
.

I
suppose
these
absences
gave
her
more
clearance
for
her
embraces
with
Cousin
Handley
.

He
wondered
how
he
got
tied
up
with
this
stranger
.

Brakes
howled
and
a
horn
blared
furiously
,
but
the
man
would
have
been
hit
if
Phil
hadn't
called
out
to
him
a
second
before
.

His
shout
had
been
involuntary
,
something
anybody
might
have
done
without
thinking
,
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
.

So
the
driver
started
to
curse
at
both
of
them
as
if
they
had
been
in
a
plot
together
to
ruin
his
safe-driving
record
.

But
he
decided
he
wouldn't
mind
company
in
return
for
free
drinks
,
even
though
he
made
good
money
at
his
job
.

Now
he
wondered
if
it
was
worth
it
,
having
a
screwball
for
company
.

He
keeps
riding
me
because
I
like
to
listen
to
the
radio
and
sing
while
I'm
taking
a
bath
.

Why
don't
they
tell
me
themselves
if
it
bothers
them
''
?
?

I
want
to
study
your
landlord's
habits
and
movements
first
.

He
went
for
more
aspirin
later
in
the
day
,
and
passed
the
surly
landlord
on
the
way
--
he
was
still
alive
and
scowling
as
usual
,
as
if
tenants
were
a
burden
in
his
life
.

Phil
shrugged
and
ignored
him
.

He
went
back
to
work
Monday
.

Coming
home
from
work
,
he
was
startled
to
see
a
police
car
parked
in
front
of
the
apartment
building
.

The
landlord
had
died
.

He
had
apparently
been
alone
.

The
stranger
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
of
course

He
might
be
very
tight
,
but
he
knew
where
he
was
.

He
looked
up
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
beheld
the
stranger
sitting
across
the
table
,
smiling
a
secret
smile
at
him
,
as
if
they
were
fellow
conspirators
.

Pete
?
?

--
he
hadn't
seen
him
sit
down
.

Haney
felt
like
shrinking
out
of
sight
,
but
he
was
already
trapped
in
the
corner
with
the
wiry
,
dark
little
man
.

``
But
why
pay
her
bills
?
?

Haney
scowled
.

``
Oh
yes
.

Now
I
see
.

Haney
felt
a
twinge
of
annoyance
when
he
heard
the
now
familiar
line
again
.

``
No
offense
intended
''
,
he
said
gently
.

After
all
,
I
didn't
know
you
,
Pete
.

``
But
if
you
say
you
managed
it
''
The
stranger
was
hooked
.

His
eyes
burned
feverishly
.

``
Of
course
it
looked
like
an
accident
.

Haney
swished
the
liquor
in
the
bottom
of
his
glass
.

I
went
through
and
down
,
into
pitch
darkness
.

He
said
,
``
Jist
stay
still
.

Jist
stay
where
you
are
''
.

``
You
first
''
,
I
said
.

Could
he
join
the
party
and
sleep
here
tonight
too
?
?

``
He'll
bring
a
bottle
too
,
and
I'll
get
another
one
or
maybe
two
while
I'm
out
.

His
``
sure-sure
''
was
enthusiastic
this
time
.

``
Git
over
by
the
window
while
there's
light
,
an'
I'll
put
th'
candle
out
.

When
yuh
come
back
I'll
put
it
out
agin
till
you're
both
inside
''
.

``
But
we
got
to
go
back
to
Fifth
and
get
another
bottle
or
two
.

When
he
handed
it
back
and
I
had
hold
of
it
safely
,
Pops
was
looking
toward
me
and
I
said
``
Now
''
,
to
Charlie
and
he
swung
the
short
length
of
lead
pipe
he'd
meanwhile
taken
from
his
pocket
,
once
.

Out
cold
,
if
not
dead
;
;

--
and
said
it
sharply
,
not
as
in
the
Patchen
bit
,
but
as
an
order
--
so
I
stopped
my
hand
and
looked
at
him
.

He
was
holding
the
piece
of
lead
pipe
out
to
me
.

``
We
don't
want
to
know
whether
he's
dead
,
yet
.

I
took
the
piece
of
pipe
from
Charlie's
hand
and
used
it
,
harder
than
he
had
.

That
did
it
,
if
mine
didn't
.

``
Nothing
.

Well
maybe
I'm
exaggerating
.

It
was
a
kick
,
but
not
a
big
enough
one
for
me
to
want
to
take
the
chance
again
,
except
for
stakes
.

Here's
the
picture
we
want
to
leave
for
the
fuzz
--
whenever
the
body
gets
found
.

This
happened
in
the
middle
of
a
drinking
bout
with
another
bum
.

How
about
you
''
?
?

``
We
can't
take
a
chance
on
that
.

We
went
once
more
over
every
point
,
then
triple-checked
.

In
fact
,
nobody
saw
us
,
cop
or
citizen
.

Which
,
if
it
matters
,
was
one
A.M.
.

How
safe
is
too
safe
?
?

We
decided
to
leave
the
third
one
intact
for
tomorrow
.

Also
our
plans
for
me
to
commit
Charlie's
murder
and
for
him
to
commit
mine
.

We
shook
hands
on
it
.

he
memorized
them
thoroughly
and
then
we
tore
them
into
tiny
pieces
and
flushed
them
down
.

it
was
not
quite
six
o'clock
when
we
finished
and
Charlie
said
,
``
Well
,
I
guess
that's
it
.

He
sighed
.

``
All
right
,
I'll
come
clean
.

So
it
wouldn't
be
for
days
or
even
a
week
before
you
could
do
anything
.

He
grinned
and
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
.

``
I
was
hoping
you'd
say
that
,
Willy
.

He
was
closer
to
understanding
it
in
English
now
,
although
it
could
never
have
the
inevitability
of
the
Martian
concept
it
stood
for
.

He
had
been
weary
;
;

``
Hi
''
!
!

Are
you
hungry
''
?
?

Mike
liked
having
light
up
through
the
ripples
;
;

the
question
was
too
wide
for
the
sparse
English
language
.

``
'
Taught
to
grow
'
''
?
?

the
Old
Ones
have
cherished
him
''
.

But
he
was
homesick
''
.

For
Mars
''
?
?

Is
that
--
I
mean
,
'
Do
you
know
'
''
--

I'll
help
''
.

Then
,
as
their
grokking
made
them
ever
closer
and
Mike
felt
himself
almost
ready
to
discorporate
her
voice
called
him
back
:
``
Oh
!
!

Oh
!
!

This
went
faster
than
scheduled
as
the
Martians
were
helpful
.

time
was
not
yet
.

A
colossal
campaign
opened
to
sell
more
sexual
organs
of
plants
and
Mrs.
Joseph
(
``
Shadow
of
Greatness
''
)
Douglas
was
quoted
as
saying
:
``
I
would
no
more
sit
down
without
flowers
on
my
table
than
without
serviettes
''
.

Fosterite
bishops
,
after
secret
conclave
,
announced
the
Church's
second
Major
Miracle
:
Supreme
Bishop
Digby
had
been
translated
bodily
to
Heaven
and
spot-promoted
to
Archangel
,
ranking
with-but-after
Archangel
Foster
.

The
glorious
news
had
been
held
up
pending
Heavenly
confirmation
of
the
elevation
of
a
new
Supreme
Bishop
,
Huey
Short
--
a
candidate
accepted
by
the
Boone
faction
after
lots
had
been
cast
repeatedly
.

But
,
I'm
telling
you
,
it'll
be
turned
down
--
you
don't
understand
the
System
yet
.

``
Okay
,
I'm
Happy
.

Where
do
I
start
''
?
?

The
girls
seemed
to
spend
half
their
time
tiptoeing
in
``
to
see
if
Mike
was
all
right
''
and
they
were
too
preoccupied
to
cook
,
much
less
be
secretaries
.

Absent-minded
,
subject
to
unexplained
tears
Jubal
would
have
bet
his
life
that
if
Anne
were
to
witness
the
Second
Coming
,
she
would
memorize
date
,
time
,
personae
,
events
,
and
barometric
pressure
without
batting
her
calm
blue
eyes
.

The
expense
and
time
involved
are
astronomical
.

However
,
we
sent
a
third
vessel
out
,
a
much
smaller
and
faster
one
than
the
first
two
.

``
That
it
had
found
a
planet
on
which
human
beings
could
live
and
which
was
already
inhabited
by
sentient
beings
''
!
!

Macneff
stopped
pacing
to
stare
at
Hal
with
his
pale
blue
eyes
.

Macneff
smiled
and
said
,
``
I
am
glad
that
your
scriptural
lessons
have
left
such
an
impression
''
.

Thought
Hal
.

He
was
my
gapt
in
the
creche
.

He
is
now
my
block
gapt
.

No
,
not
he
,
for
I
,
and
I
alone
,
am
responsible
for
whatever
happens
to
me
.

If
I
get
a
low
M.
R.
,
I
do
so
because
I
want
it
that
way
or
my
dark
self
does
.

And
it
leaves
very
soon
''
.

Then
,
he
said
,
``
Unfortunately
,
only
one
lamechian
linguist
exists
,
and
he
is
too
old
for
this
expedition
.

``
A
thousand
pardons
''
,
said
Hal
.

It's
inevitable
in
this
case
,
for
the
couple
will
be
separated
for
,
at
the
least
,
forty
years
.

Naturally
,
he
couched
the
provision
in
obscure
language
.

In
his
great
and
glorious
wisdom
,
he
knew
that
our
enemies
the
Israelites
must
not
be
able
to
read
therein
what
we
planned
''
.

This
was
no
man's
land
,
disputed
by
the
Haijac
Union
and
the
Israeli
Republic
,
a
potential
source
of
war
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
.

And
,
somewhere
in
that
enormous
light
,
was
his
apartment
.

Her
friends
and
professional
associates
would
sympathize
with
her
,
not
because
she
had
lost
a
beloved
husband
,
but
because
she
had
been
married
to
a
man
who
thought
unrealistically
.

Mary
was
free
to
marry
again
,
not
knowing
that
the
Sturch
had
secretly
given
her
a
divorce
,
thinking
that
death
had
dissolved
her
marriage
.

Hal
doubted
if
this
happy
event
would
occur
.

No
matter
who
the
candidate
for
marriage
selected
by
the
gapt

Pornsen
.

He
would
no
longer
have
to
see
that
fat
face
,
hear
that
whining
voice

Said
the
whining
voice
.

Sigmen
himself
must
have
foreseen
it
.

I
had
thought
we
would
never
again
speak
to
each
other
''
.

Upon
reaching
the
desired
speed
,
the
automatic
equipment
would
cut
off
the
drive
,
and
the
silent
but
not
empty
vessel
would
hurl
towards
the
star
which
was
its
journey's
end
.

Many
years
later
,
the
photon-counting
apparatus
in
the
nose
of
the
ship
would
determine
that
the
star
was
close
enough
to
actuate
deceleration
.

The
description
of
the
Siddo
syntax
was
very
restricted
.

And
,
as
Hal
found
out
,
obviously
mistaken
in
many
cases
.

The
same
use
of
an
entirely
different
word
applied
for
all
the
other
tenses
.

Fortunately
,
gender
was
inflected
,
though
the
expression
of
it
would
be
difficult
for
anybody
not
born
in
Siddo
.

He
had
already
become
used
to
Hesperus'
snapping
back
answers
to
questions
almost
before
Jack
could
get
them
asked
.

There
was
nothing
he
could
do
but
wait
.

Jack
,
what
is
the
nature
of
this
concept
''
?
?

Though
it
might
be
that
we
would
have
much
to
give
you
,
you
have
nothing
to
give
us
''
.

Another
pause
;
;

``
Then
it
is
a
matter
of
pleasure
;
;

But
you
should
understand
,
Jack
,
that
Hesperus
and
Lucifer
are
not
long
out
of
the
nursery
.

The
Angels
in
turn
would
exercise
similar
restraints
in
respect
for
the
natural
preferences
and
natures
of
the
Earthmen
--
but
they
had
no
faintest
notion
of
man's
perverse
habit
of
passing
and
enforcing
laws
which
were
contrary
to
his
own
preferences
and
violations
of
his
nature
.

Furthermore
,
even
the
highly
trained
law
clerk
who
was
a
part
of
Jack's
total
make-up
could
not
understand
how
the
principle
could
ever
be
codified
.

Yet
there
was
some
precedent
for
it
.

But
he
was
too
late
.

``
Hesperus
!
!

``
You
can't
see
them
yet
,
Jack
.

Jack
scanned
the
skies
,
the
boards
,
and
the
skies
again
.

No
--
there
was
a
tiny
pip
on
the
radar
;
;

and
it
was
getting
bigger
rapidly
.

Through
the
telescope
,
Jack
could
see
that
both
spacesuits
were
still
attached
to
it
.

but
even
more
awesome
was
the
fact
that
it
was
trailing
an
enormous
comet's-tail
of
Angels
.

The
skiff
was
not
heading
for
the
nursery
,
however
.

There
was
only
one
possible
answer
,
but
Jack's
horrified
mind
refused
to
believe
it
until
he
had
fed
the
radar
plots
of
the
skiff's
course
into
the
computer
.

The
curve
on
the
card
the
computer
spat
back
at
him
couldn't
be
argued
with
,
however
.

Stern
chase
10

Langer
would
have
to
be
headed
off
,
whether
he
knew
where
he
was
going
or
not
.

But
not
having
talked
to
the
Angels
,
he
had
made
a
wrong
turn
in
his
reasoning
somewhere
along
the
line
.

But
fusion
power
in
the
Coal
Sack
was
what
had
triggered
all
the
trouble
in
the
first
place
--
and
he
already
had
an
Angel
aboard
.

But
I
can't
take
you
to
Earth
yet
.

First
I've
got
to
intercept
my
brothers
before
they
get
any
deeper
into
trouble
.

Therefore
of
course
I
will
help
''
.

From
here
on
out
,
the
Ariadne
was
going
to
be
hotter
than
any
space
cruiser
man
had
ever
dreamed
of
.

But
since
he
had
failed
to
anticipate
it
,
he
lost
the
five
minutes
anyhow
,
in
plotting
an
intercept
orbit
.

He
rubbed
his
eyes
sleepily
with
one
huge
paw
.

The
facsiport
rolled
open
on
the
landscape
.

It
seemed
almost
a
magnification
of
the
Galaxy
itself
,
of
the
Milky
Way
,
blown
up
by
some
master
photographer
.

These
planets
were
much
bigger
,
nearly
all
capable
of
holding
an
atmosphere
.

``
How
can
a
planet
with
so
many
neighbors
be
so
lonely
''
?
?

``
We
can
breathe
out
there
,
all
right
.

Nitrogen
and
oxygen
are
about
it
''
.

``
Ryan
,
look
over
there
''
,
Nogol
said
.

``
You
hold
down
the
fort
,
Nogol
.

Take
it
easy
''
.

``
I
heard
a
story
once
about
a
rookie
who
got
excited
when
the
captain
stepped
outside
and
he
couldn't
get
an
encephalographic
reading
on
him
.

``
I'm
not
worried
about
you
mis-reading
the
dials
,
Nogol
,
just
about
a
lug
like
you
reading
them
at
all
.

Remember
,
when
the
little
hand
is
straight
up
that's
negative
.

``
But
I'm
ambidextrous
''
.

Actually
,
the
types
of
infection
that
could
attack
a
warm-blooded
mammal
were
not
infinite
,
and
over
the
course
of
the
last
few
hundred
years
adequate
defenses
had
been
found
for
all
basic
categories
.

He
wasn't
likely
to
come
down
with
hot
chills
and
puzzling
striped
fever
.

``
Hey
,
this
is
pretty
close
to
a
wart-hog
''
.

It
makes
you
wonder
if
this
exploration
business
isn't
all
some
big
joke
,
and
somebody
has
been
everywhere
before
you
even
started
''
.

The
big
man
seldom
gave
out
with
such
thoughts
.

Ekstrohm
cleared
his
throat
.

``
I
think
we'd
better
let
it
lay
until
we
get
a
clearer
picture
of
the
ecological
setup
around
here
.

``
It
looks
like
we
did
,
when
we
made
blastdown
''
.

``
But
what
about
our
landing
was
lethal
to
the
creatures
''
?
?

``
I
don't
know
about
that
.

Maybe
it
would
work
the
other
way
.

Maybe
because
they
have
had
virtually
no
radioactive
exposure
and
don't
have
any
R's
stored
up
,
they
could
take
a
lot
without
harm
''
.

These
critters
went
real
sudden
''
.

Ekstrohm
stood
up
.

But
what
was
there
to
do
?
?

In
privacy
he
could
walk
around
,
leave
the
light
on
,
read
.

Some
doctors
had
informed
him
he
was
mistaken
about
this
.

Actually
,
they
said
,
he
did
sleep
,
but
so
shortly
and
fitfully
that
he
forgot
.

Naturally
,
he
couldn't
let
his
shipmates
know
this
.

Ekstrohm
had
to
hide
his
secret
.

But
the
secret
itself
was
just
as
hard
.

Ekstrohm
picked
up
a
lightweight
no-back
from
the
ship's
library
,
a
book
by
Bloch
,
the
famous
twentieth
century
expert
on
sex
.

Behind
him
,
his
mates
stirred
without
waking
.

``
What
are
you
talking
about
,
Ryan
?
?

``
I'll
be
damned
''
,
Ekstrohm
said
.

ExPe
doesn't
like
anybody
mucking
up
primary
evidence
''
.

``
Listen
,
Ekstrohm
,
I
want
to
give
you
the
benefit
of
every
doubt
.

You've
been
riding
on
a
pink
ticket
for
six
years
,
you
know
that
''
.

``
All
I
know
is
that
you
were
outside
the
bubbles
last
night
,
and
you
were
the
only
sentient
being
who
came
in
or
out
of
our
alarm
web
.

``
Ryan
,
there
are
other
explanations
for
the
disappearance
of
the
bodies
.

Helva
.

She
was
not
alone
for
there
were
three
other
such
children
in
the
big
city's
special
nursery
.

As
she
matured
,
more
and
more
neural
synapses
would
be
adjusted
to
operate
other
mechanisms
that
went
into
the
maintenance
and
running
of
a
space
ship
.

As
long
as
her
development
within
her
shell
lived
up
to
expectations
,
and
there
were
no
side-effects
from
the
pituitary
tinkering
,
Helva
would
live
a
rewarding
,
rich
and
unusual
life
,
a
far
cry
from
what
she
would
have
faced
as
an
ordinary
,
``
normal
''
being
.

However
,
no
diagram
of
her
brain
patterns
,
no
early
I.Q.
tests
recorded
certain
essential
facts
about
Helva
that
Central
must
eventually
learn
.

And
very
,
very
few
were
lost
when
the
final
connection
was
made
to
the
control
panels
of
ship
or
industrial
combine
.

Helva's
civilization
was
not
without
busy
,
do-good
associations
,
exploring
possible
inhumanities
to
terrestrial
as
well
as
extraterrestrial
citizens
.

She
had
activated
one
of
her
microscopic
tools
which
she
would
later
use
for
minute
repairs
to
various
parts
of
her
control
panel
.

Shell
people
used
their
own
vocal
cords
and
diaphragms
but
sound
issued
through
microphones
rather
than
mouths
.

She
instinctively
regulated
her
``
sight
''
until
the
skin
lost
its
cratered
look
and
the
pores
assumed
normal
proportions
.

``
Vocal
peculiarities
often
become
excessively
irritating
during
prolonged
intra-stellar
distances
and
must
be
eliminated
.

``
I
meant
that
you
have
a
nice
singing
voice
dear
''
,
the
lady
amended
.

Asked
the
lady
.

``
No
,
I
say
''
,
the
lady
twittered
.

The
lady's
eyes
,
unmagnified
,
bugged
out
.

``
We
are
directed
to
develop
a
sense
of
proportion
,
sir
,
which
contributes
the
same
effect
''
.

She
had
,
of
course
,
been
exposed
to
and
enjoyed
a
music
appreciation
course
which
had
included
the
better
known
classical
works
such
as
``
Tristan
und
Isolde
''
,
``
Candide
''
,
``
Oklahoma
''
,
``
Nozze
de
Figaro
''
,
the
atomic
age
singers
,
Eileen
Farrell
,
Elvis
Presley
and
Geraldine
Todd
,
as
well
as
the
curious
rhythmic
progressions
of
the
Venusians
,
Capellan
visual
chromatics
and
the
sonic
concerti
of
the
Altairians
.

Breath
control
and
the
proper
enunciation
of
vowel
sounds
within
the
oral
cavity
appeared
to
require
the
most
development
and
practice
.

After
experimentation
,
Helva
discovered
that
she
could
manipulate
her
diaphragmic
unit
to
sustain
tone
.

She
found
herself
able
to
sing
any
role
and
any
song
which
struck
her
fancy
.

Shell
people
were
encouraged
to
develop
a
hobby
so
long
as
they
maintained
proficiency
in
their
technical
work
.

Her
first
actual
flight
,
for
she
and
her
kind
had
made
mock
flights
on
dummy
panels
since
she
was
eight
,
showed
her
complete
mastery
of
the
techniques
of
her
profession
.

``
Hello
,
anyone
at
home
''
?
?

``
No
one
has
come
.

``
No
directives
from
Central
is
scarcely
a
cause
for
regret
,
but
there
happen
to
be
eight
other
guys
biting
their
fingernails
to
the
quick
just
waiting
for
an
invitation
to
board
you
,
you
beautiful
thing
''
.

Mercer
stammered
,
not
knowing
what
B'dikkat
meant
,
and
the
two-nosed
man
answered
for
him
,
``
I
think
he
has
a
nice
baby
head
,
but
it
isn't
big
enough
for
you
to
take
yet
''
.

Mercer
never
noticed
the
needle
touch
his
arm
.

The
two
women
babbled
and
crooned
at
him
.

With
one
corner
of
his
mind
he
knew
that
they
were
saying
nothing
,
just
expressing
the
euphoria
of
a
drug
so
powerful
that
the
known
universe
had
forbidden
it
.

He
rammed
his
mind
into
focus
and
said
to
the
two
ladies
who
lay
pinkly
nude
beside
him
in
the
desert
,
``
That
was
a
good
bite
.

Said
she
,
``
I'm
strong
,
too
.

People
never
live
forever
.

Mercer
smiled
at
her
through
his
happiness
.

Mercer
wondered
how
long
the
super-condamine
had
lasted
him
.

He
watched
his
own
body
with
remote
,
casual
interest
.

he
had
.

apparently
her
many
torsos
,
stretched
out
along
the
ground
,
had
a
greater
capacity
for
retaining
the
drug
than
did
his
body
.

Did
you
ever
see
a
play
''
?
?

We
all
know
what
is
going
to
happen
.

Take
it
out
of
me
''
!
!

Mercer
himself
could
not
tell
how
long
it
was
before
B'dikkat
came
back
.

once
again
they
clustered
like
children
.

When
B'dikkat
cut
the
head
from
Mercer's
thigh
,
he
felt
the
knife
grinding
against
the
cartilage
which
held
the
head
to
his
own
body
.

he
felt
the
far
,
cool
flash
of
unimportant
pain
,
as
B'dikkat
dabbed
the
wound
with
a
corrosive
antiseptic
which
stopped
all
bleeding
immediately
.

Then
there
had
been
another
head
beside
his
own
.

He
did
not
count
time
.

In
between
teratologies
,
she
was
a
pretty
and
shapely
woman
;
;

When
he
said
it
,
they
thought
it
exceedingly
profound
,
though
none
of
them
understood
it
,
since
it
was
simply
the
amount
of
time
that
Mercer
had
been
on
Shayol
:

The
secret
little
corner
of
his
mind
,
which
stayed
sane
through
happiness
and
pain
,
made
him
wonder
about
B'dikkat
.

He
remembered
the
last
time
he
had
eaten
--
actual
eggs
from
an
actual
pan
.

The
Lady
Da
,
naked
in
the
dusty
plain
,
waved
a
hospitable
hand
and
showed
that
there
was
a
place
for
him
to
sit
beside
her
.

Once
,
like
you
,
I
had
one
head
,
two
hands
,
ten
fingers
on
my
hands
.

Now
I
can
only
write
,
and
that
only
when
I
get
out
of
pain
.

The
easiest
thing
would
be
to
sell
out
to
Al
Budd
and
leave
the
country
,
but
there
was
a
stubborn
streak
in
him
that
wouldn't
allow
it
.

Reaching
the
house
ahead
of
them
,
he
waited
with
his
Winchester
in
his
hands
.

They
were
dirty
,
their
clothes
were
torn
,
and
the
girl
was
so
exhausted
that
she
fell
when
she
was
still
twenty
feet
from
the
front
door
.

The
boy
licked
his
dry
lips
.

``
Get
up
.

There's
water
in
the
house
''
.

Any
lingering
suspicion
that
this
was
a
trick
Al
Budd
had
thought
up
was
dispelled
.

He
put
her
down
on
the
couch
,
and
going
into
the
kitchen
,
saw
that
the
boy
had
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
the
table
.

``
Who
are
you
and
what
happened
to
you
''
?
?

Morgan
nodded
.

Why
didn't
you
go
there
''
?
?

``
This
is
a
mighty
empty
country
''
,
Morgan
said
.

``
Then
we're
lucky
we
got
here
.

He
wasn't
so
sure
about
the
boy
.

He'd
be
an
idiot
to
let
them
stay
he
thought
,
but
he
couldn't
send
them
on
,
either
.

I
guess
you'd
better
go
on
in
the
morning
''
.

``
Who
are
you
?
?

This
is
the
Rafter
Aj
.

You
fell
down
in
front
of
the
house
,
and
I
carried
you
in
.

then
she
murmured
:
``
You're
very
kind
,
Mr.
Morgan
.

``
I
don't
have
many
strays
coming
to
my
front
door
''
,
he
said
.

``
Mr.
Morgan
,
it's
the
best-looking
food
I
ever
saw
''
.

He
told
himself
he
had
never
seen
two
people
eat
so
much
.

When
he
saw
the
expression
in
her
eyes
,
he
knew
he
couldn't
send
them
on
.

You'll
have
to
go
to
town
to
see
the
doc
''
.

He
nodded
at
the
door
in
front
of
him
.

``
That's
my
spare
bedroom
.

``
You're
awfully
kind
''
,
the
girl
said
.

He
was
thinking
of
Rittenhouse
and
how
he
had
left
him
there
,
to
rock
to
death
on
the
porch
of
the
Splendide
.

``
He
stuck
with
me
all
these
years
.

Just
a
half-breed
'pache
,
never
said
much
,
never
meant
anythin
to
me
,
but
he
stuck
with
me
.

I
believed
him
.

I
tried
.

God
in
Heaven
,
I
can't
refuse
you
now
.

``
The
horses
.

I'll
saddle
the
horses
and
bring
them
round
.

You
get
ready
''

Gavin's
stallion
was
in
the
barn
and
he
tightened
the
cinches
over
the
saddle
blanket
,
working
by
touch
in
the
darkness
,
comforting
the
animal
with
easy
words
.

The
mare
had
backed
away
.

``
She
doesn't
want
you
now
.

I
have
to
think
about
it
.

A
man
could
make
a
mark
there
.

``
Yes
,
like
a
father
and
son
''
.

He
approached
the
horse
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
stallion's
quivering
neck
.

Lived
alone
by
the
river
.

Clayton
swung
into
the
saddle
and
whacked
the
stallion's
rump
.

He
saw
them
ambushed
,
strewn
in
the
postures
of
the
broken
and
the
dying
.

They
passed
ranches
that
were
framed
dark
gray
against
the
black
hills
.

He
worked
his
tongue
round
and
round
in
the
hollow
of
his
cheek
and
his
voice
came
out
of
his
throat
,
dry
and
cracked
.

Clayton
is
with
him
,
takin
him
out
of
the
valley
.

You
see
,
he
lied
to
us
when
he
said
he
was
leavin
alone
''
.

And
you
stand
by
like
a
fool
and
let
him
do
it
''

There's
only
one
way
they
can
get
out
now
and
that's
through
the
Gap
--
if
we
ride
hard
we
can
take
them
''
.

Thirty-six

The
clouds
parted
and
hard
gashes
of
sunlight
swooped
down
to
stain
the
earth
with
streaks
of
white
and
gold
light
so
that
the
shadows
of
the
running
horses
flowed
like
dark
streams
over
the
dazzling
snow
.

The
mare
began
to
tire
and
Clayton
felt
the
spray
of
snow
from
the
hoofs
of
Gavin's
stallion
.

He
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
thin
dotting
of
pursuers
.

Gavin's
face
was
bloodless
with
excitement
.

he
could
feel
more
than
hear
the
staccato
beat
of
hoofs
that
fanned
out
across
the
prairie
to
the
north
.

With
every
leaping
stride
of
the
horse
beneath
him
he
crossed
one
more
patch
of
earth
that
had
been
his
,
that
he
would
never
see
again
.

The
sentry
was
not
dead
.

``
You
are
hurt
''
!
!

``
Thank
you
,
My
dear
''
,
he
said
.

Mike
silenced
them
.

``
We'll
grab
horses
''
,
Dean
said
.

Mike
debated
it
,
trying
to
decide
whether
Fiske
was
strong
enough
to
ride
.

And
,
for
the
sake
of
Julia
and
Susan
,
it
had
to
be
tried
.

Light
showed
in
the
orderly
room
across
the
parade
ground
.

Someone
evidently
was
on
duty
there
.

You
stay
with
the
ladies
.

All
of
you
be
ready
to
ride
hell
for
leather
''
.

Susan
said
fiercely
.

He
snorted
.

``
Running
around
in
the
moonlight
almost
naked
and
slugging
a
man
with
a
rock
''
?
?

And
using
him
,
Mike
McLish
,
as
a
sop
to
her
pride
.

There's
bound
to
be
someone
on
guard
,
but
the
hat
might
fool
them
long
enough
for
me
to
get
close
''
.

``
Is
that
you
,
Bill
''
?
?

The
guard
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
stockade
wall
just
out
of
reach
of
the
moonlight
.

The
explosion
of
the
rifle
had
crashed
against
the
walls
of
the
stockade
and
the
deep
echoes
were
still
rolling
in
the
hills
.

Dean
came
rushing
up
.

Mike
took
the
bayonet
from
Dean's
hand
and
slashed
the
picket
line
.

``
Ride
''
!
!

Mike
said
frantically
.

``
No
telling
how
good
this
horse
is
''
,
Mike
panted
.

You
might
need
it
.

We'll
still
have
the
rifle
,
and
I
might
be
able
to
round
up
some
more
.

I'll
stampede
the
rest
of
these
horses
so
they
can't
chase
you
''
.

Dean
leaned
from
the
saddle
and
gave
him
a
mighty
whack
on
the
back
.

The
animals
thundered
away
into
the
moonlight
,
heading
for
the
ridges
.

``
They're
stealin'
the
stock
''
!
!

He
crouched
there
.

His
shout
had
been
taken
up
and
repeated
.

Durkin
and
Calhoun
came
running
from
the
post
.

They
bawled
questions
that
were
not
answered
in
the
uproar
.

The
area
was
deserted
.

He
looked
at
the
looming
hoods
of
the
supply
wagons
,
struck
by
a
new
inspiration
.

He
set
his
bundle
down
.

He
shouldered
the
blanket
again
,
backed
off
,
and
tossed
the
lantern
with
its
open
wick
beneath
the
wagon
.

He
turned
and
raced
across
the
parade
ground
toward
the
rock
house
.

Bullets
began
to
snap
past
him
.

Susan
and
Julia
came
from
the
door
and
dragged
him
with
them
.

She
crouched
aside
as
bullets
beat
at
the
portal
,
chewing
into
the
planks
.

He
peered
from
a
loophole
.

That
halted
the
rush
.

``
Hurry
!
!

Hurry
''
!
!

The
roof
of
the
command
post
began
to
buckle
.

One
of
the
wagons
erupted
a
massive
pillar
of
flame
.

A
sizable
supply
of
powder
had
been
touched
off
.

The
glow
of
the
fire
reached
through
the
openings
in
the
windows
,
giving
light
enough
to
examine
Mike's
wound
.

Fort
up
!
!

There's
a
large
war
party
on
their
way
''
!
!

Mr.
Manuel
whispered
in
the
ears
of
the
Sioux
that
the
Cheyennes
were
comin'
to
raid
'em
for
their
horses
.

``
But
that
was
war
''
,
I
said
.

Well
,
talkin'
ain't
goin'
to
help
--
let's
fort
up
''
!
!

More
of
an
agricultural
nation
,
they
have
relied
on
their
warriors
only
for
defense
and
for
survival
in
the
endless
wars
of
the
plains
.

Still
,
I
was
disgusted
with
myself
for
agreeing
with
Montero's
methods
.

Surprisingly
,
he
had
told
the
others
what
he
had
done
.

28
.

Gray
Eyes
attacked
our
camp
just
as
the
first
pink
threads
stitched
together
the
hills
and
the
sky
.

The
cooks
had
prepared
one
of
the
best
meals
we'd
had
in
a
long
time
,
and
on
Montero's
orders
had
baked
enough
bread
to
last
the
day
.

I
didn't
catch
a
wink
.

It
was
a
relief
when
they
finally
came
.

Gray
Eyes
was
in
the
lead
.

jagged
red
and
black
medicine
symbols
covered
his
chest
.

At
first
I
thought
he
had
missed
.

I
squeezed
the
trigger
.

``
If
you're
goin'
to
kill
'em
--
!
!

Lead
up
!
!

A
horse
screamed
as
it
twisted
from
side
to
side
in
a
frenzy
.

I
forgot
to
aim
.

But
a
few
reached
our
wall
.

A
second
leaped
from
his
horse
to
the
top
of
the
bale
,
firing
four
arrows
in
such
rapid
succession
it
didn't
seem
possible
they
were
in
flight
.

The
pall
of
dust
they
raised
made
it
difficult
to
see
when
the
Aricaras
charged
again
.

Coming
over
the
wall
he
had
seemed
like
a
hideous
devil
.

Now
under
me
I
could
see
him
for
what
he
really
was
,
a
boy
dressed
up
in
streaks
of
paint
.

Some
gracefully
soared
from
the
backs
of
their
wounded
,
screaming
mounts
to
make
one
last
defiant
charge
before
the
lead
split
their
hearts
or
tore
their
guts
.

None
of
them
reached
our
walls
again
.

She
was
carrying
a
quirt
,
and
she
started
to
raise
it
,
then
let
it
fall
again
and
dangle
from
her
wrist
.

``
You
could
burn
down
this
whole
mountainside
with
a
fire
that
size
.

It's
bigger
than
it
has
to
be
,
though
I
don't
see
where
it's
doing
any
harm
.

I
own
the
place
''
.

``
Jake
Carwood
.

My
father
ran
him
off
here
six
years
ago
''
.

``
No
''
,
Wilson
said
.

``
But
it's
understandable
.

I
meant
what
I
said
about
that
fire
.

``
I
don't
mind
washing
dishes
now
and
then
''
,
he
said
pleasantly
.

It
might
hurt
you
,
though
.

She
was
quick
.

He
was
tall
and
dark-skinned
,
a
half-breed
,
Wilson
thought
.

And
he
was
handsome
,
despite
the
long
thin
scar
that
slanted
across
his
cheek
.

``
I
am
.

``
Put
the
rifle
down
,
Joseph
''
,
the
girl
said
.

It's
no
job
for
you
''
.

He
took
it
without
flinching
.

It
made
Wilson
wonder
.

They
could
hear
the
pony's
feet
on
the
dry
leaves
for
a
while
,
then
the
sound
faded
out
.

You're
pretty
hard
on
him
''
.

``
Not
now
''
,
Wilson
said
.

``
I
guess
I'll
find
out
soon
enough
.

You've
got
blood
on
your
cheek
.

Mine
.

``
I'll
bet
that's
as
close
as
you've
been
to
a
man
since
you
were
a
baby
''
,
Wilson
said
.

I've
had
enough
of
you
.

He
hadn't
shown
up
too
well
in
their
eyes
,
letting
himself
be
browbeaten
by
a
woman
.

And
determined
not
to
show
it
.

``
Both
of
you
.

He
had
a
feeling
that
the
girl
meant
trouble
.

There
would
still
be
plenty
of
moments
of
regret
and
sadness
and
guilty
relief
.

good
grass
,
good
water
.

It
hadn't
started
out
that
way
.

2

He
stood
on
the
porch
and
watched
him
struggling
with
the
heavy
harness
,
and
finally
went
over
to
help
him
.

Wilson
backed
the
team
into
the
traces
,
and
wished
they
weren't
going
to
town
at
all
.

It
was
the
only
thing
about
her
that
was
the
least
bit
hard
to
remember
.

He
had
spent
two
hours
riding
around
the
ranch
that
morning
,
and
in
broad
daylight
it
was
even
less
inviting
than
Judith
Pierce
had
made
it
seem
.

There
was
an
artificial
lake
just
out
of
sight
in
the
first
stand
of
trees
,
fed
by
a
half
dozen
springs
that
popped
out
of
the
ground
above
the
hillside
orchard
.

It
was
hotter
once
they
reached
the
flat
,
and
drier
,
but
the
grass
was
better
.

A
red-tailed
hawk
flew
in
behind
them
and
stayed
there
,
watching
for
any
snakes
or
rabbits
that
they
might
stir
up
from
the
side
of
the
road
.

Such
was
my
state
of
mind
that
I
did
not
question
the
possibility
of
this
;
;

I
went
to
the
hall
in
the
afternoons
only
,
on
these
preliminary
matters
.

Drifting
here
and
there
.

Squatting
,
as
if
waiting
.

Baldness
was
attacking
his
pate
.

When
he
saw
me
coming
he
turned
his
radio
off
.

Now
,
here
was
something
of
obvious
importance
to
me
,
yet
when
I
reached
for
the
tickets
he
snatched
them
away
from
my
hand
.

I
withdrew
my
hand
.

One
afternoon
,
upon
receiving
permission
and
the
necessary
instructions
from
the
clerk
,
I
had
visited
the
toilet
adjoining
the
hall
.

It
was
,
I
felt
,
possible
that
they
were
men
who
,
having
received
no
tickets
for
that
day
,
had
remained
in
the
hall
,
to
sleep
perhaps
,
in
the
corners
farthest
removed
from
the
counter
with
its
overhead
light
.

This
light
did
not
penetrate
very
far
back
into
the
hall
,
and
my
eyes
were
hindered
rather
than
aided
by
the
dim
daylight
entering
through
the
fan
vents
when
I
tried
to
pick
out
whatever
might
be
lying
,
or
squatting
,
on
the
floor
below
.

I
did
not
despair
,
however
;
;

I
returned
to
the
hall
,
despite
my
dislike
for
the
clerk
.

Meanwhile
spring
had
passed
well
into
summer
.

When
I
asked
him
what
,
if
anything
,
I
could
do
about
it
,
he
surprised
me
by
referring
me
to
the
director
of
the
hall
.

The
clerk
impressed
this
upon
me
:
that
I
should
not
arrive
in
the
hall
before
ten
o'clock
.

Cigarette
butts
littered
the
floor
.

I
stopped
by
the
counter
.

No
one
was
behind
it
,
but
in
the
rear
wall
of
the
office
I
noticed
,
for
the
first
time
,
a
door
which
had
been
left
partially
open
.

The
director's
office
.

he
looked
dapper
in
a
lightweight
summer
suit
,
brown
silk
tie
and
green-tinted
soft
collar
.

But
he
came
toward
me
sedately
enough
,
showed
me
around
the
counter
,
offered
me
a
seat
inside
his
office
,
then
walked
to
a
file
cabinet
and
got
out
my
application
.

I
had
the
impression
that
he
had
read
my
forms
,
perhaps
several
times
.

As
he
lowered
himself
on
the
chair
behind
his
desk
I
wondered
what
this
dapper
,
slightly
ridiculous
man
could
possibly
have
to
do
with
the
workings
of
the
hall
.

He
spoke
,
in
a
voice
as
immaculate
as
his
appearance
.

What
sort
of
men
I
would
come
into
contact
with
,
at
the
hall
?
?

I
felt
certain
that
the
director
,
like
the
afternoon
clerk
,
seldom
moved
beyond
the
counter
,
that
the
hall
,
to
them
,
was
a
jungle
,
a
dark
and
unwelcome
place
.

This
desire
,
I
went
on
,
growing
voluble
as
my
conviction
was
aroused
,
had
mounted
at
such
a
rate
recently
that
I
now
found
its
realization
necessary
not
only
to
my
physical
but
also
to
my
spiritual
wellbeing
.

Barton
said
harshly
,
``
Why
did
you
do
that
''
?
?

They
filed
out
through
the
guard-room
door
,
into
the
paved
square
.

They
had
chosen
this
night
purposely
.

They
looked
up
in
surprise
as
Powers
came
in
.

The
sergeant
turned
to
the
door
.

The
sergeant
froze
.

Five
minutes
later
they
reached
the
horses
.

They
walked
the
horses
,
heading
along
the
river
,
Barton
and
Emmett
Foster
in
the
lead
,
seven
men
riding
quietly
through
the
night
.

Five
miles
.

Foster
had
brought
extra
clothing
also
.

He
had
been
one
of
the
original
Night
Riders
,
one
who
had
escaped
the
trial
.

The
ex-prison
guard
was
embarrassed
.

It
was
all
right
to
put
a
bunch
of
ranchers
onto
horses
,
to
call
them
Night
Riders
,
to
set
out
to
attack
the
largest
mining
combination
the
country
had
ever
seen
if
all
they
wanted
was
adventure
.

Twenty
years
before
a
group
of
Easterners
had
bought
out
the
Haskell
claims
in
the
rocky
hills
south
of
Grass
Valley
.

They
had
spent
a
million
dollars
,
carving
in
a
road
,
putting
up
buildings
,
drilling
their
haulage
tunnel
.

A
company
of
cavalry
couldn't
come
in
there
if
two
men
were
guarding
that
trail
''
.

But
Kruger's
men
keep
them
off
balance
,
and
they
don't
trust
me
.

Did
you
find
him
''
?
?

``
He's
in
Morgan's
Ferry
''
.

``
What's
he
doing
there
''
?
?

``
Dealing
faro
?
?

``
Your
sister-in-law
has
the
faro
bank
in
Cap
Ayres'
saloon
''
.

Barton
cursed
under
his
breath
.

Your
cousin
Finley
saw
to
that
.

He's
quite
a
rat
,
you
know
.

He
sold
out
to
Kruger's
men
.

He
wants
your
ranch
''
.

``
If
you
hadn't
I'd
have
killed
you
''
.

That's
what
they'll
expect
you
to
do
.

``
The
hell
you
do
''
.

I've
got
to
get
the
boy
.

Barton's
men
cut
the
telegraph
wires
in
half
a
dozen
places
,
carrying
away
whole
sections
to
make
repairs
more
difficult
.

It
reached
Donald
Kruger
in
his
massive
home
in
Burlingame
.

There
a
dozen
giant
monitors
played
their
seventy-five-foot
jets
of
water
against
the
huge
seam
of
tertiary
gravel
which
was
the
mountainside
.

The
gravel
was
the
bed
of
an
ancient
river
,
buckled
in
some
prehistoric
upheaval
of
earth
.

The
monitors
ran
twenty-four
hours
each
day
.

He
lived
and
breathed
for
the
mining
company
.

Even
Hague
was
repelled
by
the
machinelike
deadliness
that
was
Kodyke
.

Kodyke
was
to
head
the
dread
company
police
.

He
pulled
open
the
top
drawer
of
his
desk
and
drew
out
a
tintype
.

``
This
is
Mitchell
Barton
.

He
broke
out
of
Folsom
last
night
.

Apparently
he
bribed
one
of
the
guards
.

You
know
how
the
ranchers
in
the
valley
are
.

Ten
years
ago
they
blew
up
some
of
our
ditches
.

The
gunman
nodded
,
slipping
the
picture
into
his
breast
pocket
,
saying
nothing
.

Then
she
turned
the
station
wagon
around
and
headed
it
back
down
the
hill
,
with
the
village
as
her
ostensible
destination
.

When
the
station
wagon
drew
abreast
of
the
dusty
dirt
road
that
led
up
to
the
porch
of
the
Culver
house
,
Pamela
turned
the
wheel
,
guiding
the
car
to
its
familiar
parking
spot
close
to
the
house
,
and
stopped
.

She
locked
the
ignition
,
removed
the
keys
,
stepped
out
of
the
car
and
went
into
the
house
.

He
had
belonged
to
this
land
and
,
perhaps
,
had
desecrated
it
--
and
this
was
the
only
material
symbol
that
remained
of
him
.

If
she
,
Pamela
,
were
being
held
responsible
for
his
crimes
,
then
hers
must
be
the
final
act
of
expiation
.

She
would
return
this
symbol
to
the
mountain
,
as
one
pours
seed
back
into
the
soil
every
Spring
or
as
ancient
fertility
cults
demand
annual
human
sacrifice
.

Perhaps
it
was
all
a
vividly
conceived
dream
.

The
ground
was
covered
with
soft
pine
needles
and
the
slope
was
gentle
.

A
few
days
ago
,
she
would
have
thought
such
an
expedition
as
this
utterly
ridiculous
;
;

today
,
on
the
contrary
,
it
seemed
utterly
reasonable
.

Success
depended
upon
maintaining
her
equanimity
;
;

Red
man
or
white
man
,
pacifist
or
killer
,
the
forest
would
accept
them
all
--
knowing
that
it
could
thrive
equally
well
on
slaughter
and
beneficence
;
;

knowing
that
its
ageless
mass
would
always
dwarf
the
short
span
of
time
allotted
to
any
man
.

Pamela
shook
her
head
.

It
was
a
bold
,
dark
castle
of
pine
boughs
that
stood
like
a
medieval
fortress
,
eclipsing
the
sun
and
human
time
.

Silence
came
into
the
forest
--
a
solid
being
that
clapped
its
hand
over
the
murmuring
mouths
of
the
birds
and
the
whispered
comfort
of
the
trees
.

She
started
to
brush
the
dirt
and
bits
of
leaves
off
her
clothes
.

The
trees
were
crowded
so
closely
together
that
their
branches
overlapped
,
virtually
shutting
out
the
sun
completely
.

There
was
a
peculiar
density
about
it
,
a
thick
substance
that
could
be
sensed
but
never
identified
,
never
actually
perceived
.

She
already
knew
this
unwholesome
,
chilling
atmosphere
that
was
somehow
grotesquely
alive
.

It
entered
her
body
with
the
ghastly
intimacy
of
an
incubus
,
and
its
particles
,
spreading
,
creeping
,
crawling
,
joined
themselves
into
steel
bands
that
constricted
her
knees
so
tightly
that
they
ached
;
;

clutched
her
throat
and
sucked
up
the
moisture
in
her
mouth
so
that
her
tongue
was
dry
and
hard
and
stuck
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
and
her
teeth
were
clenched
together
in
the
rigid
fixture
of
her
jaws
.

She
thrust
forward
through
the
shadows
and
the
trees
that
resisted
her
and
tried
to
fling
her
back
.

bushes
swished
and
scratched
at
her
slacks
;
;

tree
branches
snapped
as
she
pushed
them
ruthlessly
away
from
her
.

Miraculously
,
she
found
exactly
the
right
statement
.

She
began
it
deliberately
,
so
that
none
of
her
words
would
be
lost
on
him
.

``
I
want
to
tell
you
something
Thomas
DeMontez
Lord
.

``
To
me
you'll
always
be
the
girl
o'
my
dreams
,
an'
the
sweetest
flower
that
grows
''
.

Beaming
idiotically
,
he
pooched
out
his
lips
and
attempted
to
kiss
her
.

Lord
nodded
agreeably
.

He
opened
the
door
and
got
out
.

He
waited
at
the
car
side
for
a
moment
,
looking
down
at
her
expectantly
.

Then
,
helpfully
,
as
she
merely
stared
at
him
in
weary
silence
,
``
Maybe
you
could
write
it
down
for
me
,
huh
?
?

He
went
prone
on
his
stomach
,
the
better
to
pursue
his
examination
.

Never
,
he'd
once
told
Joyce
,
had
he
encountered
any
man
or
situation
that
called
for
a
gun
.

Just
a
big
pile
of
self-confidence
in
an
almost
teensy
package
.

He
slid
in
at
her
side
,
tucked
a
cigar
into
his
mouth
,
and
politely
proffered
one
to
her
.

``
Can't
you
stop
that
stupid
clowning
for
even
a
minute
''
?
?

On
the
other
hand
,
howsomever
,
maybe
you
wouldn't
either
.

``
How
--
with
what
?
?

There's
nothing
out
here
but
rattlesnakes
''
.

sufficiently
,
at
least
,
to
get
them
back
into
town
.

``
What
did
you
mean
by
that
rattlesnake
gag
?
?

The
car
lurched
along
at
a
snail's
crawl
,
the
left-front
mudguard
banging
and
scraping
against
the
tire
,
occasionally
scraping
against
the
road
itself
.

Lord
whistled
tunelessly
as
he
fought
the
steering
wheel
.

Joyce
had
seen
him
like
this
once
before
--
more
than
once
,
actually
,
but
on
one
particularly
memorable
occasion
.

It
was
payday
for
Highlands
,
and
he
was
packing
a
lot
of
money
back
into
the
oil
fields
.

Moreover
,
as
long
as
the
weapon
was
carried
openly
,
the
sheriff's
office
had
made
no
previous
issue
of
it
.

It
was
the
wrong
thing
to
say
.

He
said
.

``
We
aim
t'
be
see-lective
,
y'know
?
?

Figger
we
got
to
be
plumb
careful
with
any
of
you
Highlands
big
shots
''
.

He
was
an
honest
man
doing
a
hard
job
,
and
the
implication
that
he
was
anything
else
was
unbearable
.

``
uh-huh
.

So
you
get
rid
of
that
pistol
right
now
,
Mis-ter
McBride
.

Not
without
a
face-saving
respite
of
at
least
a
few
minutes
.

Now
,
Mis-ter
McBride
''
,
said
Lord
,
and
he
laid
a
firmly
restraining
hand
on
the
field
boss's
arm
.

He
flung
off
Lord's
hand
and
attempted
to
push
past
him
,
inadvertently
shoving
him
into
a
storefront
.

Then
,
as
he
doubled
,
gasping
,
vomiting
the
breakfast
he
had
so
lately
eaten
,
Lord
straightened
him
with
an
uppercut
.

A
rabbit
punch
redoubled
him
.

No
more
could
he
defend
himself
against
them
.

I've
given
willful
hurt
to
no
man
.

He
,
McBride
,
would
be
cited
as
in
the
wrong
,
and
he
,
Lord
,
would
go
scot-free
,
an
officer
who
had
only
done
his
duty
,
though
perhaps
too
energetically
.

The
herd
was
watered
and
then
thrown
onto
a
broad
grass
flat
which
was
to
be
the
first
night's
bedground
.

There
was
some
idle
talk
,
a
listless
discussion
of
this
or
that
small
happening
during
the
day's
drive
.

The
cook
,
Mateo
Garcia
,
had
arrived
there
long
before
the
herd
.

Conchita
kept
an
eye
on
the
twins
and
little
Elena
,
trying
to
keep
them
from
falling
into
the
creek
by
which
they
persisted
in
playing
.

She
wondered
what
had
taken
place
in
town
,
between
him
and
his
wife
.

You
too
,
Sean
!
!

He
was
in
earnest
conversation
with
her
father
and
the
old
vaquero
,
Luis
Hernandez
.

Certainly
,
she
wouldn't
dare
ask
her
father
afterward
.

At
the
moment
,
the
three
men
were
not
saying
much
of
anything
.

``
Let's
hear
it
,
anyway
''
.

``
Wait
a
little
while
.

Let
Senora
Brannon
live
in
her
father's
house
for
a
time
.

After
all
,
you
want
the
senora
as
much
as
you
want
the
boy
.

``
A
year
,
Luis
?
?

Five
?
?

Ten
?
?

How
long
should
I
wait
''
?
?

``
Maybe
in
a
year
,
Tomas
.

''

``
In
a
year
she'll
like
living
in
Clayton's
house
too
much
to
come
back
to
me
''
,
Brannon
said
flatly
.

Brannon
looked
at
Hank
Maguire
.

If
you
take
the
one
,
you'd
better
take
both
''
.

Brannon
shook
his
head
.

``
I
won't
force
Beth
to
come
against
her
will
.

It
was
to
be
nothing
more
than
that
.

The
seventh
man
was
Red
Hogan
,
a
wiry
little
puncher
with
a
wild
streak
and
a
liking
for
hell-raising
.

Lighted
windows
glowed
jewel-bright
through
the
downpour
.

``
Maybe
to
have
supper
.

Hogan
got
down
from
the
saddle
and
had
a
look
inside
.

It
shouldn't
be
long
''
.

They
closed
in
fast
,
kept
him
from
reaching
inside
his
coat
for
his
gun
.

``
Just
come
along
''
,
Brannon
told
him
.

``
Brannon
,
I
warn
you
''
!
!

``
Every
last
one
of
you
.

Red
Hogan's
patience
ran
out
.

``
Key
''
?
?

Macklin
said
.

Come
on
--
the
key
.

His
face
took
on
a
sudden
pallor
,
became
beaded
with
sweat
,
and
he
seemed
to
have
trouble
with
his
breathing
.

It's
here
in
my
pocket
''
.

Once
the
door
was
open
,
they
crowded
him
inside
the
dark
building
.

Deputy
Marshal
Luke
Harper
still
stood
guard
on
the
veranda
,
a
forlorn
,
scarecrowish
figure
in
the
murky
dark
.

``
Don't
try
it
''
,
Brannon
told
him
,
dismounting
and
starting
up
the
steps
with
his
men
following
.

The
others
followed
Brannon
inside
.

There
had
been
no
sign
of
a
rifleman
and
no
track
or
trace
to
show
that
anyone
had
been
near
.

He
had
cursed
at
them
and
threatened
them
.

This
time
Lewis
had
his
own
rifle
in
his
hands
,
and
he
threw
some
answering
fire
back
at
the
mysterious
far-off
shot
,
then
spent
most
of
the
day
searching
out
the
area
.

He
found
nothing
,
but
he
still
refused
to
give
up
and
move
out
.

A
bullet
smashed
directly
into
the
center
of
William
Lewis'
chest
.

Two
more
shots
followed
in
quick
succession
,
dropping
him
limp
and
huddled
on
the
ground
.

An
inquest
was
held
,
and
after
a
good
deal
of
testimony
about
the
anonymous
notes
,
the
county
coroner
estimated
that
the
shooting
had
been
done
from
a
distance
of
300
yards
.

He
immediately
rode
on
to
Cheyenne
,
threw
a
ten-day
drinking
spree
and
dropped
some
very
strong
hints
among
friends
.

``
Three
shots
in
that
fella
'fore
he
hit
the
ground
!
!

But
there
were
other
homesteaders
who
passed
the
Lewis
murder
off
as
a
personal
grudge
killing
,
the
work
of
one
of
his
neighbors
.

The
rustling
problem
was
by
no
means
solved
.

Even
in
the
very
area
where
the
shooting
had
been
done
,
cattle
were
still
disappearing
.

``
Fred
was
mighty
crude
about
the
way
he
took
in
cattle
''
his
own
hired
man
,
Andy
Ross
,
mentioned
later
.

But
he
brought
back
the
sheriff
and
several
deputies
,
and
to
the
lawmen
the
entire
affair
seemed
a
repetition
of
the
Lewis
killing
.

``
Exterminatin'
cow
thieves
is
just
a
business
proposition
with
me
''
,
he'd
blandly
announce
.

They
wouldn't
o'
stood
no
chance
with
you
in
a
plain
,
straight-out
shoot-down
''
.

He
had
lots
of
friends
,
then
as
always
.

No
man's
name
brought
more
cheers
when
it
was
announced
in
a
rodeo
.

``
But
well
,
it
just
don't
seem
sportin'
somehow
''
!
!

``
Sportin'
''
!
!

``
Sportin'
''
!
!

He
echoed
again
in
soft
wonder
.

I
heard
o'
Texas
cattlemen
wrappin'
a
cow
thief
up
in
green
hides
and
lettin'
the
sun
shrink
'em
and
squeeze
him
to
death
.

After
the
first
two
murders
,
the
warning
notes
were
rarely
ignored
.

Houses
of
settlers
who'd
treated
the
company
herds
as
a
natural
resource
,
free
for
the
taking
,
were
sitting
empty
,
with
weeds
growing
high
in
their
yards
.

The
small
half-heartedly
tended
fields
of
men
who'd
spent
more
time
rustling
cattle
than
farming
were
lying
fallow
.

(
The
best
evidence
is
that
he
received
a
monthly
wage
of
about
$125
,
very
good
money
in
an
era
when
top
hands
worked
for
$30
and
found
.

He
had
made
himself
the
personification
of
the
Devil
to
the
homesteaders
.

The
hands
and
their
bosses
saw
him
as
a
lone
knight
of
the
range
,
waging
a
dedicated
crusade
against
a
lawless
new
society
that
was
threatening
a
beloved
way
of
life
.

I
just
want
you
to
take
a
message
to
Diane
Molinari
.

Tell
her
to
come
here
to
the
hotel
''
.

``
Eagle's
Nest
ought
to
have
a
fire
company
.

His
face
pale
,
Summers
headed
for
the
street
.

The
fact
that
Jess's
horse
had
not
been
returned
to
its
stall
could
indicate
that
Diane's
information
had
been
wrong
,
but
Curt
didn't
interpret
it
this
way
.

From
the
back
of
the
barn
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
reach
Black's
house
without
using
the
street
.

He
could
hear
horses
moving
around
inside
,
and
nothing
else
.

He
moved
ahead
carefully
,
his
left
hand
in
front
of
him
,
and
came
to
a
wooden
partition
.

Presently
he
heard
footsteps
crossing
the
yard
,
and
Jess's
smothered
curses
.

The
door
swung
open
,
and
Jess
said
sourly
,
``
What
the
hell's
the
matter
with
you
?
?

A
match
flared
,
and
he
reached
above
his
head
to
light
a
lantern
which
hung
from
a
wire
loop
.

Jess
caught
his
breath
in
surprise
.

He
started
to
reach
for
his
gun
,
but
apparently
thought
better
of
it
.

He
reached
out
to
pull
the
door
shut
and
fasten
it
with
a
sliding
bolt
.

You
won't
be
needing
this
''
.

``
We
ain't
got
nothing
to
talk
about
.

There
was
raw
fury
in
his
eyes
,
and
the
veins
of
his
neck
were
swollen
.

Jess
stiffened
.

Curt's
fingers
put
a
little
more
pressure
on
the
trigger
of
his
gun
.

Was
it
Dutch
Brenner
''
?
?

Curt
was
holding
Jess's
gun
in
his
left
hand
.

Pistol-whipping
an
unarmed
man
might
come
easy
to
someone
like
Jess
,
but
Curt
couldn't
bring
himself
to
do
it
.

``
Having
all
the
guns
makes
you
a
big
man
,
don't
it
,
Adams
?
?

If
we
was
both
armed
,
you
wouldn't
talk
so
tough
''
.

He
retreated
a
step
and
holstered
his
own
.

I
just
wanted
to
hear
you
say
so
''
.

It
was
like
hitting
a
sack
of
salt
.

When
his
head
came
down
,
Curt
grabbed
him
by
the
hair
and
catapulted
him
head
first
into
the
wall
.

Even
Black's
old
crowbait
began
to
snort
,
and
from
the
house
Black
yelled
,
``
Jess
!
!

He
lurched
drunkenly
to
his
feet
,
lowered
his
head
,
and
took
one
step
away
from
the
wall
.

``
It
was
Brenner's
idea
''
,
Jess
mumbled
,
dabbing
at
his
nose
.

``
He
found
out
about
you
and
Arbuckle
talking
.

Leaving
Jess's
where
it
lay
,
he
left
the
stall
.

We're
going
someplace
''
.

This
dirty
coward
just
admitted
killing
Arbuckle
.

You're
coming
along
peacefully
,
or
I'll
put
a
bullet
in
your
leg
''
.

Jess
stumbled
through
the
door
.

``
Honey
''
,
he
whispered
.

His
wounds
need
dressing
now
''
.

He
released
her
reluctantly
for
her
enthusiastic
reunion
with
Old
Hap
.

Jackson
was
doing
most
of
the
talking
.

From
the
way
the
wound
in
his
head
was
itching
,
Dan
knew
that
it
would
heal
.

The
Burnsides
,
now
ready
to
roll
,
were
purposefully
deaf
to
his
cry
.

Slipping
her
hand
in
his
,
they
silently
watched
the
Burnsides
make
the
bend
in
the
road
and
disappear
from
sight
.

Seeing
them
waiting
there
at
the
foot
of
Emigrant
Rock
was
so
overwhelming
that
,
for
a
good
minute
after
they
rounded
the
bend
and
started
down
the
grade
leading
toward
them
,
Matilda
could
not
speak
at
all
.

Hez
asked
,
who
still
believed
they'd
have
them
to
lick
.

``
They
ain't
even
in
sight
''
!
!

By
then
Hez
could
see
for
himself
,
and
so
could
the
others
.

Soon
they
were
all
shouting
greetings
,
exchanging
smiles
,
and
rejoicing
to
think
that
they
were
all
back
together
again
.

No
sooner
did
they
hear
of
Dan's
injury
than
both
Gran
and
Matilda
went
into
immediate
action
.

But
with
Bill
O'Connor
on
the
fiddle
,
and
Gran
Harrow
exuberantly
shouting
``
Glory
Be
''
and
``
Hallelujah
''
above
their
united
chant
of
the
lilting
old
ballads
,
they
played
their
quaint
folk
games
with
all
the
fervor
and
abandon
of
a
real
celebration
.

Rod
shifted
his
eager
eyes
from
the
milling
group
out
in
the
circle
long
enough
to
reply
,
``
I
ain't
much
of
a
hand
for
Dare-Base
and
Farmer-in-the-Dell
,
but
I'd
sure
like
to
get
in
on
the
handhold
and
wrestles
''
.

With
a
swift
swoop
of
his
big
arms
,
he
grabbed
Sally
out
of
the
circle
surrounding
him
,
and
then
kissed
her
soundly
before
setting
her
down
so
she
could
stand
by
his
side
while
they
jointly
chose
the
rest
of
their
``
outfit
''
.

Soon
she
saw
Rod
and
Hez
moving
over
to
join
them
.

``
My
souls'
a-gracious
''
!
!

The
three
men
stepped
out
to
the
side
to
wait
for
Captain
Clemens'
signal
.

``
Reckon
ye're
right
,
Dan
''
,
Hez
called
back
over
his
shoulder
.

Before
Harmony
had
a
chance
to
reply
,
Rod
cracked
his
long
whip
over
his
thin
oxen's
backs
.

``
Gyp'll
be
holdin'
forth
in
some
bar
if
he's
here
at
all
''
,
Cobb
declared
,
glancing
along
the
street
as
they
stretched
their
legs
.

There
were
no
less
than
six
or
seven
saloons
in
Ganado
,
not
counting
the
lower
class
dives
,
all
vying
for
the
trade
of
celebrating
miners
and
teamsters
.

``
Take
one
side
of
the
street
,
and
I'll
take
the
other
''
,
he
proposed
.

``
If
you
spot
Carmer
give
a
yell
before
you
move
in
''
.

Suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
insane
that
they
might
hope
to
locate
Gyp
Carmer
so
casually
,
even
were
he
to
prove
the
thief
.

Behind
its
ornate
facade
the
notorious
dive
clung
like
a
bird's
nest
to
the
rocky
ribs
of
the
canyonside
.

The
front
windows
of
the
place
were
long
and
narrow
,
reaching
nearly
to
the
floor
and
affording
an
unusually
good
view
of
the
interior
.

``
What
luck
,
Cobb
''
?
?

A
man
knocked
the
roulette
ball
about
idly
in
its
track
,
and
another
dozed
at
one
of
the
card
tables
.

All
the
doors
were
open
at
this
hour
except
one
,
and
it
was
toward
this
that
Stevens
made
his
way
with
Russ
close
at
his
shoulder
.

He
started
to
struggle
up
,
heaving
desperately
.

I've
drawn
his
fangs
''
,
he
snapped
.

``
Look
at
this
''
!
!

``
By
golly
,
Stevens
!
!

``
Shall
we
get
out
of
here
''
?
?

Glowering
looks
met
them
in
the
bar
,
but
there
was
no
attempt
to
halt
them
.

To
his
faint
surprise
Russ
held
up
his
hand
.

I've
had
enough
.

It
was
you
that
tracked
it
down
anyway
,
Stevens
''
,
he
pursued
strictly
.

``
Whatever
you
say
''
.

``
Old
Crip
wasn't
''
,
retorted
Cobb
tartly
.

But
I
want
this
to
sink
in
awhile
.

Then
maybe
next
time
he
won't
be
so
quick
on
the
trigger
''
.

``
You're
the
doctor
''
,
he
returned
with
a
smile
.

Pat
let
him
go
,
following
more
leisurely
.

At
the
first
restaurant
he
sensibly
pulled
up
to
go
in
for
his
dinner
,
and
as
a
consequence
did
not
see
Cobb
strike
the
open
range
at
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
and
head
straight
across
the
swells
for
Antler
.

The
truth
was
,
the
puncher
was
both
bewildered
and
dismayed
by
his
own
mixed
luck
.

How
much
of
an
accident
could
that
be
''
?
?

What
did
it
mean
?
?

Clapping
spurs
to
the
bronc
he
set
off
at
a
sharp
canter
,
with
growing
alarm
.

Setting
a
course
straight
for
the
house
,
he
was
covering
ground
fast
when
an
angry
bee
buzzed
past
close
to
his
face
.

``
Over
this
way
!
!

Dismounting
,
Russ
looked
about
hastily
.

Another
snarled
close
overhead
.

Sweeping
a
look
around
,
he
saw
that
he
was
safe
for
the
moment
.

He
dashed
madly
for
the
next
elbow
turn
in
the
draw
,
and
made
it
.

Early
in
November
the
clouds
lifted
enough
to
carry
out
the
assigned
missions
.

No
one
had
much
to
say
.

The
truck
dropped
them
off
at
the
various
revetments
spread
through
the
jungle
.

His
face
was
dark
as
the
sky
above
it
as
he
stood
on
the
wing
and
waited
for
his
pilot
.

See
you
''
,
Donovan
said
as
he
jumped
off
the
wing
.

The
expression
was
his
trade-mark
,
his
open
sesame
to
good
luck
,
and
his
prayer
that
pilot
and
plane
would
always
return
.

At
the
prearranged
time
,
Greg
started
the
engine
and
taxied
out
.

The
dark
brown
bombs
hanging
under
each
wing
looked
large
and
powerful
.

``
Somebody
beat
us
to
it
''
!
!

Finally
,
as
time
began
to
run
out
,
he
headed
into
Ormoc
and
glide-bombed
a
group
of
houses
that
Intelligence
had
thought
might
contain
Japanese
supplies
.

Greg
went
up
tight
against
the
ceiling
and
led
them
back
to
their
pass
to
home
.

He
was
about
to
make
a
gas
check
on
his
flight
when
Todman's
voice
broke
in
:
``
Sweeneys
!
!

The
same
old
question
.

But
it
also
made
him
conspicuous
to
the
enemy
,
if
it
was
the
enemy
,
and
he
hadn't
been
spotted
already
.

In
seconds
,
Greg
made
his
decision
.

He
pushed
the
radio
button
.

The
planes
,
light
with
most
of
the
gas
burned
out
,
responded
beautifully
.

The
opposing
aircraft
continued
to
come
on
.

``
Todman
,
drop
your
second
element
back
.

Greg
slapped
his
hand
across
the
switches
that
turned
on
the
guns
and
gun
camera
and
gun
sight
.

``
Arm
your
guns
,
Sweeneys
''
.

They're
Japs
''
,
came
a
high-pitched
voice
.

No
turns
.

That's
an
order
''
.

``
They
haven't
seen
us
''
.

He
hit
the
radio
button
.

``
Now
,
Sweeneys
,
now
.

Perfect
,
he
thought
.

The
Jap's
propeller
flew
off
in
pieces
.

He
pushed
stick
and
rudder
and
entered
the
overcast
on
his
back
.

He
fought
the
panic
of
vertigo
.

We
were
coming
to
an
intersection
,
turning
right
,
chuffing
to
a
stop
.

``
Gracias
.

I
waved
with
discretion
and
moderation
to
the
vague
golden
faces
fading
through
rising
dust
and
the
distortions
of
the
back
window
glass
.

White-shirted
and
conservatively-cravated
drivers
stared
conspicuously
toward
the
eastern
horizon
and
past
my
supplicating
and
accusing
gaze
.

``
Mor-ee-air-teeeee
''
,
he
shrieked
,
his
white
teeth
grossly
counterpointing
those
of
the
glittering
blonde
.

``
Onleh

Mrs.
Roebuck
continued
.

But
Corporal
Johnson
has
alreadeh
said

.

Mrs.
Roebuck
thought
Johnson
was
a
``
sweet
bawh
t'lah
lahk
thet
''
,
but
her
Herman
was
getting
to
be
a
man
,
there
was
no
getting
around
it
.

And
re-echo
.

it
flopped
down
,
sprang
back
up
and
gouged
my
shin
.

I
drew
back
,
drawing
back
my
foot
for
a
kick
.

Did
an
anteater
want
ants
?
?

I
wouldn't
have
known
the
difference
.

We
were
in
a
field
,
in
a
tight
,
screeching
turn
.

We
were
back
on
the
road
.

``
That
was
Tee-wah
I
was
talking
.

Too
high
.

On
unoccupied
roadway
the
bottle
shattered
into
a
small
amber
flash
.

I
started
looking
on
the
splintery
truck
bed
for
a
piece
of
board
,
a
dirt
clod
--
anything
I
could
throw
and
with
better
aim
than
I
had
thrown
the
beer
bottle
.

We
were
slowing
.

In
the
ditch
sand
was
white
and
soft-looking
,
only
an
occasional
pebble
discernible
,
faintly
gleaming
.

On
the
truck
bed
there
was
nothing
smaller
than
a
piece
of
rusty
machinery
;
;

Looking
back
I
saw
a
gray-haired
man
getting
out
of
his
halted
car
and
trying
to
read
our
license
number
.

Two
cars
came
over
a
crest
,
their
chrome
and
glass
flashing
.

I
looked
back
at
pale
ovals
framed
in
the
elongated
oval
of
the
car's
rear
window
.

Eyes
like
hot
honey
,
eyes
that
sizzled
.

She
smiled
.

It
was
her
first
smile
.

``
Sure
''
.

``
No
,
thanks
''
.

``
Zing
''
!
!

I
mean
:
Is
advertising
honest
?
?

About

The
water
in
Thor's
big
swimming
pool
had
been
covered
with
a
blanket
of
thick
,
foamy
soapsuds
--
fashioned
,
of
course
,
from
zing
--
Joyce
had
dived
from
the
board
into
the
pool
,
then
swirled
and
cavorted
in
her
luxurious
``
bath
''
while
cameras
rolled
.

The
finished
--
and
drastically
cut
--
product
would
begin
with
a
hazy
longshot
of
Joyce
entering
the
suds
,
then
bursting
above
the
pool's
surface
clad
in
layers
of
lavender
lather
,
and
I
had
a
hunch
this
item
was
going
to
sell
tons
and
tons
of
soap
;
;

Joyce
went
on
,
``
When
we'd
finished
,
Lou
--
Mr.
Thor
--
asked
me
to
stay
a
little
longer
.

Everybody
left
and
I
stayed
in
the
pool
,
then
Lou
came
back
alone
and
leaped
into
the
pool
too
.

And
he
didn't
have
any
clothes
on
''
.

I
swam
like
mad
,
got
out
of
the
pool
,
grabbed
my
robe
,
and
ran
to
the
car
.

Her
impact
in
the
zing
commercials
had
led
to
her
being
considered
for
an
excellent
part
in
an
upcoming
TV
series
,
Underwater
Western
Eye
,
a
documentary-type
show
to
be
sponsored
by
Oatnut
Grits
.

I
could
show
what
I
can
do
''
.

There
I
got
my
Colt
Special
and
shoulder
harness
,
slipped
my
coat
on
,
and
went
back
into
the
front
room
.

One
of
my
virtues
or
vices
is
a
sort
of
three-dimensional
imagination
complete
with
sound
effects
and
glorious
living
color
.

It'll
probably
be
at
least
an
hour
or
two
before
I
can
check
back
with
you
.

You'd
better
hurry
''
.

She
smiled
slightly
.

I
spun
about
and
clattered
through
the
front
room
to
the
door
.

Hell
,
she
couldn't
.

But
the
scene
was
not
the
quiet
,
calm
scene
I'd
expected
.

Two
uniformed
officers
,
a
couple
of
plain-clothesmen
I
knew
,
and
two
other
men
stood
on
a
gray
cement
area
next
to
the
pool
on
my
left
.

At
the
pool's
far
end
was
the
little
cabana
Joyce
had
mentioned
,
and
on
the
water's
surface
floated
scattered
lavender
patches
of
limp-looking
lather
.

He
didn't
push
it
;
;

A
call
to
the
police
had
been
placed
from
here
a
couple
of
minutes
after
nine
P.M.
,
and
the
first
police
car
had
arrived
two
or
three
minutes
after
that
--
10
minutes
ago
now
.

I
said
,
``
O.K.
,
so
now
only
Blake
knows
.

Deputy
coroner
says
it
looks
like
he
sucked
in
a
big
pile
of
those
thick
suds
and
strangled
on
'em
.

If
it
were
not
for
an
old
professor
who
made
me
read
the
classics
I
would
have
been
stymied
on
what
to
do
,
and
now
I
understand
why
they
are
classics
;
;

those
who
wrote
them
knew
people
and
what
made
people
tick
.

When
my
Uncle
offered
me
a
part-time
job
which
would
take
care
of
my
normal
expenses
and
give
me
time
to
paint
I
accepted
.

The
arrangement
turned
out
to
be
excellent
.

It
was
as
if
they
could
hardly
wait
to
get
into
their
costumes
,
cover
their
faces
with
masks
and
go
adventuring
.

My
new
Aunt
was
perhaps
three
or
four
years
older
than
I
and
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
I
had
seen
as
gorgeous
a
woman
who
oozed
sex
.

I
was
aware
that
when
our
eyes
met
we
both
quickly
averted
them
.

Why
she
married
him
I
do
not
know
.

or
maybe
she
liked
men
old
enough
to
be
her
father
;
;

I
was
waiting
in
front
of
it
when
she
showed
up
and
told
me
of
my
Uncle's
indisposition
.

``
I
know
.

I
was
thinking
about
that
.

``
I
guess
we
both
felt
it
''
.

I
think
I
have
a
way
so
we
can
carry
on
without
his
suspecting
us
''
.

And
to
prove
what
you
tell
him
about
me
you
suggest
that
he
keep
the
date
instead
.

``
Don't
worry
about
me
.

``
Are
you
trying
to
cut
your
throat
''
?
?

A
few
minutes
later
I
saw
my
Uncle's
car
drive
up
and
a
woman's
figure
emerge
and
walk
to
the
corner
.

In
one
hand
he
gripped
firmly
a
parasol
though
there
had
been
no
indication
of
rain
.

He
was
looking
out
on
the
dark
waters
of
the
Lake
when
I
came
upon
him
and
without
wasting
words
I
smacked
him
hard
across
the
face
.

He
had
better
write
a
postcard
to
Walter
.

Five
days
later
,
on
receiving
it
,
Meredith
sat
drumming
his
dactyls
on
his
writing
table
.

The
voice
crying
in
him
was
the
voice
of
guilt
.

Now
,
he
was
just
in
the
late
poems
of
Holderlin
and
therefore
had
most
of
the
nineteenth
century
before
him
--
plus
next
semester's
class
preparation
.

Should
she
wake
him
?
?

To
this
meek
conjugation
Nicolas
had
replied
,
``
O.K.
I
can
use
this
blanket
.

And
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
Nicolas
had
slept
in
the
park
only
part
of
one
night
,
when
he
discovered
that
Munich's
early
mornings
even
in
summer
are
laden
with
dew
.

Packing
a
small
suitcase
,
informing
her
husband
whom
she
found
in
Harry's
Bar
that
she
was
taking
a
train
to
Germany
to
get
away
for
a
while
,
patting
his
arm
,
refusing
a
drink
,
getting
on
the
train
--
all
this
had
only
taken
her
two
hours
.

``
Dear
girl
''
,
Walter
had
finally
said
,
``
he
writes
me
that
he
is
sleeping
in
the
English
Gardens
''
.

Should
she
wake
him
?
?

The
sun
grew
hotter
as
it
approached
the
midday
.

His
nose
was
tickled
.

He
sneezed
.

He
belched
,
he
stretched
.

The
Grafin
,
who
was
charmed
by
her
,
told
her
,
``
Your
sister
who
was
here
two
years
ago
has
quite
dark
hair
.

You
shall
see
her
at
dinner
''
.

He
was
asking
had
it
been
she
who
left
the
love
note
in
his
sheets
(
she
also
served
as
maid
)
when
he
saw
the
Grafin
followed
by
a
stately
blond
girl
approaching
his
table
.

It
would
be
literary
license
calculated
to
glamorize
life
to
say
that
he
,
oh
,
dropped
his
napkin
,
so
startled
was
he
by
Mary
Jane's
beauty
.

Her
white
blond
hair
was
clean
and
brushed
long
straight
down
to
her
shoulders
.

Perhaps
her
eyes
were
larger
and
more
of
a
summer
blue
for
all
they
had
seen
and
wept
that
day
.

veal
cutlets
:
``
Oh
,
I
couldn't
possibly
eat
all
this
''
!
!

Fruit
compote
:
``
If
you
think
I
would
understand
it
''
;
;

The
third
time
rather
urgently
.

They
were
west
of
the
Sabine
,
but
only
God
knew
where
.

And
the
valley
stretched
endlessly
out
ahead
,
scorched
and
baked
and
writhing
in
its
heat
,
until
it
vanished
into
the
throbbing
wall
of
fiery
orange
brown
haze
.

``
Hoa-whup
''
!
!

The
dust-thick
saliva
came
from
his
mouth
like
balled
cotton
.

He
moved
back
to
the
wheel
and
stood
there
blowing
,
grasping
the
top
of
a
spoke
to
still
the
trembling
of
his
played-out
limbs
.

He
unlashed
the
dipper
and
drew
water
from
a
barrel
.

But
it
was
water
.

She
scoffed
.

They'll
roll
off
in
another
day
.

``
Hettie
''
,
he
said
as
gently
as
he
could
,
``
we're
still
headed
west
.

``
Maybe
in
time
to
make
a
cross
and
dig
our
graves
''
.

His
wide
mouth
compressed
.

It
had
been
five
days
too
late
before
he
learned
that
she'd
gone
through
the
wedding
ceremony
in
a
semitrance
of
laudanum
,
administered
by
her
mother
.

He
had
left
her
inviolate
,
thinking
familiarity
would
gentle
her
in
time
.

``
Hettie
,
they
didn't
sell
you
''
,
he
said
miserably
.

``
I
might
have
starved
,
but
at
least
I
wouldn't
be
fried
to
a
crisp
and
soaked
with
dirt
''
!
!

He
darkened
under
his
heavy
burn
.

He
had
never
seen
clouds
like
them
before
,
but
he
had
the
primitive
feel
of
danger
that
gripped
a
man
before
a
hurricane
in
Carolina
.

The
six-ton
Conestoga
began
to
whip
and
shake
.

The
heavens
opened
,
pelting
them
with
hail
the
size
of
walnuts
.

Walls
of
water
rushed
down
the
slopes
and
filled
the
hollows
like
the
crests
of
flash
floods
.

They
were
engulfed
by
the
weird
silence
,
broken
only
by
the
low
,
angry
murmur
of
the
river
.

Then
the
darkness
thinned
,
and
there
was
light
again
,
and
then
bright
sunlight
.

She
did
not
call
out
.

But
as
the
tree
passed
,
she
lifted
an
arm
in
gesture
of
better
luck
and
farewell
.

He
sputtered
back
to
his
feet
and
scrambled
madly
to
pull
his
bags
of
seed
grain
forward
.

They
were
already
swollen
to
bursting
.

He
examined
the
water
marks
on
the
iron
tires
when
the
animals
were
finished
.

The
spokes
were
tight
again
,
the
iron
tires
gripped
onto
the
wheels
as
if
of
one
piece
.

He
furled
the
slashed
sides
of
the
canvas
tarpaulins
,
leaving
the
ribs
and
wagon
open
.

He
sprinted
to
the
rail
and
leaped
overboard
into
the
shark-infested
waters
.

We
pulled
and
swore
and
yanked
and
wept
,
scraping
our
hands
until
they
bled
profusely
.

Three
days
previously
,
we
had
steamed
past
barren
Rennell
Island
in
the
distance
.

There
were
gigantic
blisters
and
rope
burns
on
our
hands
;
;

``
Even
when
the
islands
were
under
German
mandate
before
World
War
1
,
,
Europeans
gave
Eromonga
a
wide
berth
.

I
remembered
,
too
,
the
jesting
voice
of
a
classmate
,
Bobby
Pauson
:
``
But
how
do
they
reproduce
,
Dr.
Griggs
?
?

I'm
sure
that
males
have
something
to
do
with
that
process
''
!
!

Often
,
I
heard
my
uncles
and
cousins
speak
of
it
when
I
was
a
small
boy
growing
up
in
Rabaul
.

our
sore
and
burned
hands
and
arms
need
attention
''
.

The
girl
in
the
prow
of
the
outrigger
turned
a
smile
like
a
beacon
on
me
.

I
noted
that
her
full
breasts
were
bare
and
that
she
wore
a
garland
of
red
pandanus
fruit
in
her
blue-black
hair
.

All
my
rosy
visions
of
rest
and
even
pleasure
on
this
island
vanished
at
the
sight
.

The
man
must
have
leaped
to
his
death
from
the
topmost
rung
of
the
tultul
.

It
took
thirty
of
our
women
almost
six
moons
to
build
this
one
,
which
is
higher
and
stronger
than
the
old
one
.

He
looked
as
if
he
was
going
to
keel
over
.

I
clapped
the
big
man
with
the
bleached
hair
on
his
shoulder
and
said
heartily
,
hoping
it
would
make
an
impression
on
the
women
:
``
This
one
is
the
maku
Frayne
.

Brassnose
turned
a
stricken
face
toward
me
and
said
brokenly
,
``
Sommers
,
you
meddling
Yank
,
you're
a
fool
!
!

They
despise
males
who
brag
of
their
strength
;
;

You've
ruined
me
,
blast
you
''
!
!

The
man
was
an
ox
and
he
put
up
a
creditable
struggle
;
;

but
four
Eromonga
women
are
more
than
a
match
for
the
strongest
male
that
ever
lived
.

Miraculously
,
Karipo
and
her
women
had
succeeded
in
driving
a
hundred
invaders
from
the
isle
of
Pamasu
back
to
their
war
canoes
,
after
considerable
loss
of
life
on
both
sides
.

Those
who
stayed
had
to
pass
tests
.

The
old
woman
arose
stiffly
and
led
me
to
a
clearing
where
a
small
hut
stood
.

Maybe
to
beat
up
on
his
squaw
''
.

Somehow
the
thought
of
a
simple
man
bewildered
by
things
no
one
had
ever
really
helped
him
understand
moved
the
driver
.

Maybe
he
was
only
doing
the
best
he
knew
how
,
like
any
of
us
.

He
said
to
his
partner
.

Just
see
it
''
.

Never
Benny
.

A
few
minutes
later
the
insurance
man
,
a
road
checker
,
drove
up
in
the
gray
coupe
with
license
plates
on
it
from
a
far-away
state
.

He
chatted
with
Ramey
and
Benson
for
a
minute
or
so
in
the
meager
shade
of
the
trailer
.

How
would
you
ever
see
her
again
?
?

Her
glance
swung
past
the
trailer
where
the
two
drivers
were
standing
.

What
had
caught
his
attention
was
obscured
by
the
car
itself
,
so
that
neither
the
girl
nor
the
truck
drivers
could
see
,
but
Benson
knew
what
it
was
.

Benson
said
to
Ramey
.

The
slightest
twitch
would
have
parted
the
shoe
entirely
from
the
foot
,
yet
the
toes
were
still
inside
.

He
turned
and
bent
over
the
body
of
the
Indian
.

His
words
were
mostly
to
himself
.

``
Don't
''
.

The
sneaker
reached
out
once
more
to
tap
against
the
mass
and
Ramey's
vision
darkened
except
for
an
unreasonable
clarity
of
the
man's
leg
.

He
stared
at
the
shining
,
shining
circles
of
hairs
and
heard
the
voice
of
his
partner
through
trees
,
``
Don't
do
that
,
fella
.

Ramey's
fist
and
the
air
expelled
from
the
man's
collapsing
cheek
made
a
hollow
pop
in
the
air
like
cupped
hands
clapping
together
.

With
a
thoughtful
look
,
the
man
sat
on
the
pavement
,
legs
straight
out
in
front
of
him
.

The
man
brought
one
hand
up
slowly
and
the
fingers
fumbled
across
his
face
until
he
touched
his
mouth
.

``
Why
did
you
do
it
--
why
did
you
hit
him
''
?
?

She
said
,
her
voice
rising
.

Ramey
said
nothing
.

No
one
seemed
to
know
for
sure
what
had
happened
,
nor
was
there
any
purpose
or
responsibility
in
the
muttering
feet
and
urgent
voices
behind
the
driver
,
beyond
finding
out
.

Ramey
looked
around
and
caught
sight
of
his
partner
near
the
front
end
of
the
wrecked
truck
talking
to
the
patrolman
.

Benson
moved
his
arms
,
gesturing
with
an
unfamiliar
vigor
and
talking
rapidly
.

Some
of
the
ruddiness
was
gone
from
his
face
and
he
stared
at
Ramey
.

Then
he
calmly
and
carefully
slugged
the
remaining
five
shots
into
the
venomous
head
--
caught
in
the
wicker
back
of
the
chair
,
the
eyes
dead
on
him
as
the
life
finally
went
out
of
the
brute
.

He
heard
their
chattering
,
and
then
the
sounds
of
hacking
as
they
dismembered
the
snake
right
on
the
porch
with
wood
axes
.

It
was
only
then
that
he
turned
to
look
at
Penny
.

She
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
again
,
back
in
the
same
position
where
the
snake
had
found
her
.

But
her
hands
were
calm
,
now
.

I
don't
suppose
a
wife
should
be
grateful
to
her
husband
for
saving
her
life
,
but
I
am
.

And
for
the
hundredth
time
that
week
,
he
was
startled
at
her
beauty
.

Seven
years
they'd
been
married
.

Now
,
she
just
sat
there
looking
at
him
,
without
an
expression
except
concern
for
him
.

``
We're
all
God's
creatures
,
aren't
we
''
?
?

And
you
love
Ahmiri
,
that
black
bastard
of
a
servant
even
a
little
more
,
because
he's
a
beautiful
man
.

We're
all
God's
creatures
,
aren't
we
,
Penny
?
?

The
Brahmaputra
has
its
headwaters
in
the
tableland
of
the
world
,
the
towering
white
headwalls
of
the
Himalayas
that
are
unknown
to
man
as
any
other
space
on
the
planet
.

At
first
it
had
been
just
a
romantic
dream
of
his
,
the
same
as
the
idea
of
finishing
Oxford
after
the
war
.

And
Keith's
record
of
kills
made
him
a
man
to
listen
to
--
a
man
paradoxically
,
who
might
even
survive
.

He
knew
how
to
shoot
down
Nazis
.

He
enjoyed
killing
.

And
he
would
have
enjoyed
it
just
as
much
if
he
had
been
a
Nazi
.

The
Nazis
bombed
Britain
,
so
the
RAF
retaliated
and
shot
them
all
down
.

Not
quite
.

They
don't
go
for
bull-like
muscle
,
as
a
rule
.

Penny
and
Keith
had
no
romance
.

The
Nazis
knew
this
,
of
course
,
and
while
their
chief
quarry
was
the
industrial
centers
,
they
let
a
few
drop
every
time
they
went
over
,
hoping
for
a
lucky
hit
.

There
was
a
measure
of
protection
in
its
concrete
walls
and
ceiling
,
but
the
engineers
who
hastily
installed
it
were
well
aware
that
concrete
is
not
much
better
than
prayer
,
if
as
efficacious
,
when
a
direct
hit
comes
along
.

The
bomb
plunged
into
the
ground
near
the
Post
,
but
not
precisely
into
the
Command
room
itself
.

She
came
from
Ohio
,
from
what
she
called
a
``
small
farm
''
of
two
hundred
acres
,
as
indeed
it
was
to
farmer-type
farmers
.

But
to
Keith's
London-bred
mind
,
such
acreage
sounded
rather
invincible
.

He
couldn't
stop
killing
.

The
terrible
power
of
a
gun
,
the
thing
that
blasted
the
soul
out
of
a
living
body
,
man
or
beast
,
was
one
he
never
wanted
to
lose
.

When
they
got
to
Shillong
,
in
Assam
,
he
was
happy
.

The
great
black
leopards
.

But
there
are
big
rogues
in
both
countries
.

Robinson
clambered
heavily
into
the
boat
,
sat
down
,
and
stripped
off
his
triple-tank
assembly
.

``
The
equipment
was
fine
''
,
Rob
stated
,
standing
up
.

He
stared
stonily
at
the
floor
.

You
don't
head
back
down
again
.

Not
me
,
anyway
.

``
Rob's
not
going
to
give
up
as
easy
as
all
that
''
.

He
went
to
Key
West
every
fall
and
winter
and
was
the
only
man
in
town
who
did
not
know
that
his
title
of
``
Commodore
''
was
never
used
without
irony
.

Hell
,
I
gave
him
the
first
decent
job
he
ever
had
,
six
,
seven
--
how
many
years
ago
was
it
,
Rob
''
?
?

He
went
down
the
steps
to
the
galley
and
sleeping
quarters
;
;

``
When
you
gotta
go
,
you
gotta
go
''
,
Mrs.
Forsythe
said
.

``
Hi
there
,
Schaffner
''
,
he
had
said
.

``
Can
I
make
you
one
''
?
?

``
Well
,
no
''
,
Herr
Schaffner
said
.

``
What
do
you
mean
''
?
?

Now
I
wish
to
enter
the
American
market
,
where
the
competition
is
very
strong
.

Waddell
was
not
an
eminently
moral
person
,
but
he
did
not
like
what
he
had
just
heard
.

``
Perhaps
not
in
so
many
words
''
,
the
German
said
.

``
But
surely
you
have
misunderstood
Mr.
Roy
.

Never
,
never
did
I
offer
him
the
exclusive
rights
.

We
spoke
of
the
need
for
advertising
,
and
I
agreed
that
the
deep
dive
would
be
most
useful
for
publicity
.

He
started
out
the
door
.

``
You
intend
to
speak
with
Mr.
Roy
''
?
?

``
If
you
will
pardon
,
I
think
it
would
be
better
if
not
.

I
know
this
from
my
talks
with
him
''
.

``
On
the
basis
of
the
facts
''
.

It
is
not
good
,
Mr.
Waddell
:
you
will
do
him
great
harm
''
.

There
was
no
doubt
that
Herr
Schaffner
meant
every
word
of
what
he
said
.

``
He
has
the
distributorship
for
Florida
,
you
say
''
?
?

``
Yes
''
,
the
German
said
.

``
Thank
you
''
,
the
German
had
said
courteously
.

Now
,
in
that
same
cabin
,
Robinson
fell
to
his
knees
beside
a
bunk
.

Let
me
set
the
record
this
time
,
and
let
me
get
back
OK
,
so
the
German
will
give
me
the
exclusive
.

And
make
my
life
different
and
better
from
this
time
on
.

Artie
had
picked
up
a
snorkle
and
was
twirling
it
on
his
forefinger
.

``
You
know
I
know
it
''
,
Robinson
answered
warily
.

``
Well
,
I
was
a
little
bit
confused
.

``
I
don't
think
you
should
go
down
again
''
.

Early
that
day
Matsuo
saw
a
marine
.

He
had
no
doubt
the
marine
was
the
lead
scout
of
a
column
,
and
while
his
shot
had
probably
bred
indecision
,
they
would
soon
come
hunting
.

He
had
no
rice
.

The
knife
,
an
ammunition
pouch
,
and
a
half-filled
bottle
of
purified
water
hung
on
his
belt
.

The
marine
came
to
the
edge
of
the
green
jungle
mist
and
stayed
,
as
though
debating
whether
to
brave
the
sunlight
.

His
fatigues
made
a
streak
of
almost
phosphorescent
green
in
the
mist
.

A
signal
?
?

The
marines
let
him
advance
.

When
he
sank
on
his
knees
,
they
had
allowed
him
to
char
without
administering
the
stroke
of
mercy
.

Matsuo
repeatedly
choked
down
his
own
nausea
.

At
nightfall
he
had
been
able
to
sneak
down
a
hillside
and
into
the
jungle
,
reeking
of
death
.

He
strained
his
hearing
.

faint
creaking
of
belts
and
slings
;
;

whispers
:
he
heard
none
of
these
.

While
his
comrades
cocked
the
trap
,
that
one
behaved
as
if
it
was
some
dull
maneuver
.

Hush
followed
.

Like
a
mischievous
boy
expecting
punishment
,
Matsuo
awaited
reaction
from
the
jungle
.

The
pockets
of
his
jacket
bulged
.

Hand
grenades
.

They
could
come
on
him
now
without
difficulty
.

The
marine
was
sprawled
some
thirty
yards
away
,
one
arm
extended
.

Rifle
leveled
on
the
man
,
he
made
a
rush
.

Heat
,
in
the
sunlight
,
pressed
in
like
an
invisible
crowd
.

He
squatted
by
the
head
,
gently
placing
the
rifle
on
the
ground
.

In
the
other
:
a
wristwatch
with
broken
crystal
wrapped
in
a
dirty
handkerchief
.

One
by
one
he
tossed
the
objects
aside
.

Then
there
was
no
saying
how
many
times
the
marine
had
blown
his
nose
on
the
handkerchief
.

Matsuo
put
the
bottle
to
his
own
lips
.

Matsuo
shook
his
head
.

Every
so
often
he
turned
the
knife
.

burned
each
hand
when
they
came
groping
again
.

``
A
small
measure
of
payment
,
marine
''
.

He
dropped
the
knife
in
its
scabbard
,
hung
the
rifle
behind
a
shoulder
.

The
marine
,
hands
on
cheeks
,
rolled
by
his
unwounded
side
onto
his
stomach
.

He
ceased
weeping
.

As
Matsuo
climbed
by
using
the
vines
and
kicking
his
feet
against
the
trunk
,
a
mood
of
gloom
immersed
him
like
a
jungle
shadow
.

What
now
?
?

In
the
jungle
,
birds
were
mute
,
while
insects
preserved
only
the
monotony
of
living
.

He
cupped
his
mouth
and
yelled
.

Matsuo
laughed
,
slung
the
rifle
.

His
superiors
had
said
that
all
marines
were
depraved
.

He
began
to
uncap
the
bottle
,
the
rusty
cap
squealing
on
its
threads
.

And
when
this
was
gone
,
he
hadn't
even
a
little
bitter
tablet
to
purify
other
water
if
he
were
to
discover
some
stagnant
jungle
pool
.

The
upper
part
of
his
packet
had
stained
dark
.

In
China
it
was
a
baby
sitting
on
a
railroad
platform
,
smudged
,
blood-specked
,
with
the
village
burning
about
him
and
shells
exploding
.

``
Seems
to
me
I
don't
remember
altering
any
law
about
that
''
.

The
stranger
ignored
him
.

Blue
Throat
winked
at
his
six
cronies
.

``
The
kid
has
no
manners
,
boys
.

Tilghman's
clenched
fist
swept
over
in
a
terrific
right
cross
and
clipped
the
big
gunfighter
on
the
side
of
his
chin
.

Tilghman
leapt
on
to
him
,
dragged
him
upright
and
hit
him
again
,
this
time
sending
him
careening
against
the
bar
.

Tilghman
flung
himself
aside
,
dropped
on
one
knee
and
pulled
his
own
gun
.

``
Yes
,
George
,
but
I
ain't
got
poor
old
Pat's
body
yet
.

In
two
minutes
the
body
of
Tilghman's
former
comrade
,
who
had
been
killed
by
Blue
Throat
in
a
gambling
brawl
the
previous
night
,
was
carried
into
the
town's
funeral
parlor
to
be
prepared
for
decent
burial
.

Any
posse
riding
down
the
street
to
demand
Blue
Throat's
surrender
would
be
wiped
out
with
one
deadly
burst
of
fire
.

The
law-abiding
citizens
of
Petrie
had
gathered
inside
Kaster's
Store
,
halfway
down
the
street
.

Several
were
firing
into
the
barn
when
Billy
Tilghman
arrived
.

``
If
Blue
Throat
has
his
way
he'll
keep
us
all
cooped
up
in
here
for
days
''
,
he
said
.

``
There's
only
one
thing
to
move
him
fast
,
and
we
have
it
right
here
in
this
very
store
''
.

``
I'm
gonna
drop
these
into
Blue
Throat's
lap
''
,
he
announced
,
``
and
I'd
like
every
gun
to
be
firing
into
that
barn
while
I
get
near
enough
to
toss
'em
through
the
window
''
.

He
slipped
outside
,
hugging
the
walls
of
buildings
and
dodging
into
doorways
.

Blue
Throat's
men
spotted
him
and
a
hail
of
bullets
splintered
the
store
fronts
and
board
walk
as
he
passed
.

Though
only
slightly
injured
himself
the
big
hoodlum
never
returned
to
those
parts
.

Of
all
the
rip-roaring
two-fisted
tough
boys
of
the
Old
West
,
``
Uncle
Billy
Tilghman
''
stands
out
head
and
shoulders
.

He
was
the
lawman
who
survived
more
gunfights
than
any
other
famous
gun-slinging
character
in
the
book
.

For
fifty
years
his
guns
and
ham-like
fists
shot
holes
through
and
battered
the
daylights
out
of
the
enemies
of
law
and
order
in
the
frontier
towns
of
the
West
.

Citizens
took
the
view
that
a
lawman
was
expected
to
risk
his
life
on
the
odd
occasion
anyway
,
but
this
fighting
fury
of
a
man
risked
it
regularly
over
a
period
of
half
a
century
.

Tilghman
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
walked
towards
the
fire
.

Along
each
side
of
the
room
were
six
tiered
bunks
,
each
one
screened
off
with
a
curtain
.

The
men
behind
them
were
Bill
Doolin
and
five
of
his
gang
--
every
man
a
killer
.

Can't
seem
to
locate
landmarks
in
this
snow
''
.

``
Jed's
homestead
is
on
the
south
bank
''
.

One
false
move
on
his
part
and
he
would
be
a
dead
man
.

If
he
showed
signs
of
collecting
his
rifle
and
going
back
with
his
deputy
to
the
ranch
he
would
be
shot
down
instantly
.

This
Woman
had
no
distinct
shape
or
size
and
no
particular
face
,
but
she
radiated
warmth
,
a
sweet
warmth
;
;

When
he
awoke
in
the
mornings
,
she
was
in
his
mind
and
he
could
hardly
wait
to
get
to
school
to
be
near
her
in
the
flesh
.

Something
was
beginning
to
stir
and
come
alive
in
her
,
too
(
it
may
have
been
there
for
a
good
while
,
since
she
was
twenty
now
;
;

Once
(
this
was
on
the
third
day
of
school
)
she
kneeled
down
to
pick
up
some
books
where
they'd
dropped
on
the
floor
and
Jack
looked
up
her
dress
--
at
the
bare
expanse
of
incredibly
white
leg
.

He
thought
for
a
moment
his
heart
had
stopped
beating
.

He
jumped
back
,
ducked
and
ran
,
crouching
,
down
the
hill
away
from
the
school
.

``
I've
got
to
get
her
''
.

She
said
,
with
the
solicitude
of
a
middle-aged
woman
for
her
only
child
.

``
No
,
I'm
not
hungry
''
,
he
said
,
pushing
back
the
bacon
and
eggs
.

``
No
.

``
Hell
,
I
jist
got
on
top
of
--
''

``
It's
all
over
Branchville
.

If
you'd
get
out
of
your
back
yard
once
in
a
while
you
might
even
get
her
your
ownself
''
.

Miss
Langford
,
in
a
fresh
white
dress
and
low-heeled
white
sandals
,
without
socks
,
was
out
there
with
them
,
trying
to
get
them
inside
.

``
Let's
go
inside
''
.

``
Oh
,
come
on
Miss
Langford
,
play
with
us
just
onct
''
,
one
of
the
little
girls
begged
,
smiling
wistfully
.

``
No
,
not
now
''
,
said
the
teacher
.

Come
inside
now
''
.

Jack
watched
Miss
Langford
all
morning
.

At
noontime
,
remembering
what
the
teacher
had
said
about
maybe
playing
with
the
kids
,
Jack
stayed
close
to
the
schoolhouse
while
all
the
other
big
boys
,
except
Charles
,
went
off
out
the
road
to
play
ball
.

``
O.K.
''
Charles
rose
also
,
and
the
two
of
them
moved
over
to
join
the
girls
.

``
That's
all
right
''
,
she
said
,
tossing
her
head
back
to
get
the
hair
out
of
her
eyes
.

``
It
was
my
fault
''
.

``
Thank
you
''
,
she
said
,
dusting
herself
off
.

He
had
considered
throwing
erasers
or
flipping
paperwads
at
someone
or
pulling
the
hair
of
the
girl
sitting
in
front
of
him
,
but
he
couldn't
take
a
chance
on
either
of
these
possibilities
:
the
teacher
probably
would
make
him
stand
face-to-wall
in
a
corner
instead
of
stay
in
after
school
.

The
only
drawback
now
to
the
plan
he'd
decided
on
was
that
someone
else
might
fail
to
do
his
work
,
too
,
and
the
teacher
would
have
that
person
stay
late
along
with
Jack
.

``
You
will
stay
here
thirty
minutes
after
the
others
go
home
this
afternoon
and
work
your
problems
''
.

On
the
fringe
of
the
amused
throng
of
white
onlookers
stood
a
young
woman
of
remarkable
beauty
and
poise
.

The
youth
with
the
snake
had
a
natural
pride
and
joy
of
life
which
appealed
to
the
woman
.

The
haughty
white
girl
turned
to
a
distinguished
,
hawk-faced
man
standing
at
her
side
and
murmured
:
``
Look
at
your
watch
,
Col.
Garvier
.

The
slaves
ran
gaily
to
the
center
of
Congo
Square
and
gathered
around
a
sweaty
youth
they
called
Johnny
No-Name
.

The
slender
,
handsome
fellow
was
called
Dandy
Brandon
by
the
other
slaves
.

Shy
,
actually
,
he
avoided
feminine
overtures
and
seemed
truly
ignorant
of
the
girls'
desires
when
they
sought
to
make
liaisons
with
him
in
the
open
fields
,
in
carriages
and
in
boathouses
.

``
What
is
your
name
,
boy
?
?

Come
a
bit
closer
.

I
won't
bite
,
you
know
''
.

``
My
name
is
Dandy
Brandon
,
missy
.

Satisfied
at
last
,
and
after
a
few
amorous
gambits
on
her
part
which
convinced
Delphine
that
Dandy
was
capable
of
learning
new
arts
,
she
opened
the
window
and
called
to
her
liveried
driver
.

If
the
old
fool
argues
about
the
price
,
tell
him
I
shall
order
my
husband
not
to
treat
him
as
a
patient
any
longer

Besides
,
he
owns
300
slaves
.

His
bold
eyes
raked
the
woman
,
and
a
perceptive
spectator
might
sense
that
there
was
more
to
their
relationship
than
that
of
slave
to
owner
.

He
saw
a
pint-sized
man
with
a
graying
spade
beard
and
an
unusually
large
head
.

He
deserves
a
better
life
than
just
rotting
away
on
the
Prieur
plantation
''
.

The
physician
led
the
horses
to
the
stable
after
a
cursory
glance
at
the
cringing
slave
.

Had
Dandy
been
older
or
wiser
,
instinct
might
have
warned
him
that
he
would
be
well
advised
to
flee
from
the
Lalauries'
tender
care
if
he
valued
his
life
.

So
Dandy
Brandon
trustingly
entered
the
house
with
Delphine
Lalaurie
and
trudged
up
the
rear
steps
to
the
attic
room
which
was
to
be
his
new
home
.

Just
six
weeks
after
Dandy
Brandon's
arrival
at
the
mansion
,
the
little
surgeon
and
his
svelte
young
wife
gave
their
annual
open
house
and
ball
,
to
which
only
New
Orleans'
oldest
and
wealthiest
families
were
invited
.

You
did
this
you
like
to
hurt
to
beat
people
I
want
to
go
home
''
.

Guests
stared
with
horror
at
Madame
Lalaurie
and
made
speedy
departures
.

She
daubed
at
her
swimming
eyes
with
a
lacy
handkerchief
and
said
with
obvious
emotion
:
``
That
poor
boy
!
!

Then
,
on
July
2
,
there
occurred
another
incident
which
set
tongues
to
wagging
at
a
furious
clip
.

Since
then
,
and
since
the
pure
grain
had
gotten
him
divorced
from
every
decent
--
and
even
indecent
--
group
from
Greenwich
Village
to
the
Embarcadero
,
he
had
become
a
sucker-rolling
freight-jumper
.

Out
and
out
and
never
to
return
again
.

He
was
pressed
far
back
into
the
corner
of
the
car
on
his
hay
sacks
,
the
rattling
and
tinning
of
the
wheels
on
the
rails
almost
covering
the
sound
of
his
ocarina
.

He
held
his
elbows
away
from
his
body
,
and
the
little
sweet
potato
trilled
neatly
and
sweetly
as
he
tickled
its
tune-belly
.

A
little
thing
,
but
the
right
twist
for
the
action
that
counted
.

Hot
,
that
was
the
word
,
hot
!
!

A
poet
,
yet
!
!

``
Yeah
,
seems
so
,
don't
it
''
,
the
boy
laughed
,
hugging
her
close
.

``
None
of
that
.

We
don't
know
this
guy
''
.

``
We
--
we
eloped
''
,
Cappy
said
.

They
couldn't
have
much
dough
,
but
then
none
of
the
freight-bums
Feathertop
rolled
had
much
.

``
I'm
just
a
poor
ex-jazz
man
,
name
of
--
uh
--
Boyd
Smith
''
.

He's
a
nice
guy
''
.

He
had
it
all
doped
,
of
course
.

Kitty
inquired
politely
.

``
Where
from
''
?
?

``
What's
the
matter
,
she
wanna
go
the
bathroom
''
?
?

``
Whyn't
ya
say
so
,
fellow
travelers
!
!

Cappy
looked
wary
,
but
he
moved
off
the
floorboards
and
followed
the
dirty
ex-musician
to
the
center
of
the
refuse-littered
boxcar
.

He
took
out
a
small
packet
filled
with
bits
of
charcoal
,
a
deep
pot
of
thin
metal
,
some
sheets
of
newspaper
,
a
book
of
matches
and
a
wrinkled
and
many-times
folded
piece
of
tin
foil
with
holes
in
it
.

``
Fan
it
''
,
he
told
Cappy
,
handing
him
a
sheet
of
newspaper
.

``
Hot
dogs
,
man
.

When
they
had
licked
the
last
of
the
wieners'
taste
from
their
fingers
,
they
settled
back
,
and
Cappy
offered
Ernie
a
cigarette
.

Ernie
asked
.

``
Why
didn't
he
want
you
to
get
hitched
''
?
?

After
a
few
seconds
,
she
said
,
``
Dad
didn't
like
Cappy
.

It
was
my
fault
''
.

``
Your
fault
,
hell
!
!

If
I'd
been
careful
it
never
woulda
''
--
he
stopped
abruptly
.

``
Oh
he
was
stupid
,
her
old
man
!
!

He
remembered
Midge
,
and
the
child
.

But
that
had
been
a
time
before
all
this
,
a
time
he
didn't
think
about
.

These
are
just
another
couple
of
characters
to
roll
.

``
Wanna
drink
''
?
?

From
the
man
who
had
leaped
in
from
the
high
bank
outside
,
as
the
train
had
slowed
on
the
grade
.

He
was
big
.

Real
big
,
with
shoulders
out
to
here
,
and
hair
all
over
him
like
a
grizzly
.

The
big
man
asked
again
,
taking
a
step
into
the
boxcar
.

This
character
could
break
him
in
half
.

He
took
the
bottle
with
undue
belligerence
,
and
making
sucking
noises
with
his
thick
lips
,
drained
it
completely
.

He
threw
his
head
back
,
closed
his
eyes
,
and
belched
ferociously
.

``
We're
going
to
Philadelphia
''
,
Kitty
said
,
pulling
her
skirt
down
around
her
legs
all
the
more
.

He
advanced
on
them
,
and
abruptly
there
was
a
shocked
electricity
in
the
car
.

Ernie
was
screaming
inside
himself
:
No
,
damn
you
,
you
ain't
gonna
take
my
meal
ticket
away
from
me
!
!

They
went
down
in
a
heap
and
for
a
long
minute
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
flailing
arms
and
legs
.

Or
the
surging
whirling
sounds
of
bats
at
night
,
when
their
black
bodies
dived
into
the
blackness
above
and
below
the
amber
street
lights
.

Or
the
bay
of
female
dogs
in
heat
.

It
went
to
church
on
Sunday
and
one
Saturday
a
month
went
to
confession
.

With
a
tiny
fur-piece
wrapped
around
her
shoulders
,
she
wiggled
her
satin-covered
buttocks
down
the
street
before
him
and
didn't
stop
.

The
way
she
strutted
down
the
street
,
the
Old
Man
would
have
been
blind
not
to
have
noticed
both
.

``
But
she
shouldn't
have
come
here
in
the
first
place
''
,
the
women
had
said
.

His
voice
had
not
commanded
her
to
stop
.

Perhaps
he
had
known
then
where
that
hundred
dollar
bill
had
come
from
and
where
it
was
taking
his
wife
.

It
squatted
low
and
square
upon
the
sidewalk
with
a
heavy
iron
grating
supporting
a
glass
facade
.

And
the
forked
tongue
of
gossip
licked
its
sinister
way
from
back
porch
to
back
porch
.

They
kept
him
alive
,
waiting
.

It
was
as
though
he
had
made
a
pact
with
the
devil
himself
,
but
it
was
not
yet
time
to
pay
the
price
.

At
fifteen
he
didn't
care
that
he
had
no
mother
,
that
he
couldn't
remember
her
face
or
her
touch
;
;

neither
did
he
care
that
Aunt
Rose
provided
for
him
.

To
him
life
was
a
restless
boredom
that
began
with
the
rising
sun
and
ended
only
with
sleep
.

He
would
not
be
like
the
``
rich
Americans
''
who
lived
in
white-columned
houses
on
the
other
side
of
the
park
.

One
lithe
leg
straddled
the
railing
and
swung
loosely
before
the
creaking
,
torn
pales
.

Well
,
what
did
that
matter
when
the
sun
was
shining
and
there
were
dreams
to
dream
about
?
?

``
Christ
sake
,
goat
,
git
''
!
!

Pompeii
expected
Romeo's
small
body
to
sink
closer
and
closer
to
the
ground
.

she
developed
a
peaches
and
cream
complexion
and
a
sunny
disposition
,
and
she
asked
for
nothing
more
of
life
than
that
she
be
kept
dry
and
comfortable
and
fed
huge
amounts
of
food
at
stated
intervals
and
be
carried
to
where
she
could
watch
activity
going
on
around
her
.

Maggie
couldn't
seem
to
get
her
strength
back
or
catch
up
with
herself
with
all
she
had
to
do
:
there
was
the
big
basket
of
clothes
to
be
coaxed
through
the
rackety
old
washer
and
lugged
out
and
lugged
back
;
;

there
was
the
daily
round
of
household
chores
in
which
Maggie
insisted
on
participating
.

In
desperation
Maggie
consulted
Eugenia
one
afternoon
:
``
Do
you
think
you
could
find
me
something
I
could
do
here
at
home
to
make
some
money
,
so
I
could
still
watch
the
baby
and
do
the
rest
of
the
things
''
?
?

``
It
seems
to
me
you
have
enough
to
do
as
it
is
''
,
Eugenia
said
.

``
I
have
plenty
of
odd
moments
when
I
could
be
doing
something
''
,
Maggie
said
.

``
For
one
thing
you
can
stop
keeping
that
child
in
starched
dresses
and
changed
from
the
skin
out
nineteen
times
a
day
''
.

``
Evadna
Mae
Evans
said
she
didn't
put
a
thing
on
her
child
but
a
flannel
wrapper
until
it
was
nine
months
old
''
.

Maggie
started
laughing
,
and
she
laughed
so
hard
she
couldn't
stop
,
and
she
kept
on
laughing
while
she
lugged
the
clothes
out
to
the
yard
to
hang
them
up
while
the
sun
was
still
shining
.

``
I
have
here
that
you
could
run
a
nursery
of
your
own
for
working
mothers
''
,
Eugenia
said
.

``
We
could
put
up
cribs
on
the
second
floor
sleeping
porch
and
turn
the
front
bedroom
into
a
playroom
where
it's
nice
and
sunny
,
but
of
course
it
would
entail
quite
a
bit
of
running
up
and
down
stairs
and
Chris
said
you
were
to
be
careful
about
that
''
.

``
Don't
worry
,
I
can
get
plenty
more
''
,
Eugenia
said
,
wondering
where
in
the
world
she
could
.

``
And
then
whenever
I
have
a
minute
I
can
be
working
at
it
,
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
baby
and
the
stove
at
the
same
time
.

She
said
,
``
Oh
Eugenia
,
I
wish
''

``
What
''
?
?

The
jobless
huddled
in
the
streets
outside
of
employment
offices
,
outside
newspaper
buildings
,
in
parks
,
in
relief
lines
,
outside
government
agencies
.

Shivering
,
people
talked
and
argued
;
;

Something
had
to
be
done
about
the
furnace
,
the
fuel
bills
,
the
washing
machine
,
the
doctor
and
dentist
bills
,
about
making
money
stretch
for
food
,
for
the
mortgage
,
for
taxes
,
for
shoes
,
for
half
soles
,
for
overshoes
,
for
clothes
,
for
the
new
leaks
in
the
roof
,
for
gas
and
light
bills
;
;

about
keeping
warm
,
about
keeping
well
,
about
meeting
the
minor
emergencies
that
came
up
once
,
twice
,
fifty
times
a
day
.

The
pipes
burst
and
they
all
laughed
and
stood
in
ice
water
to
their
ankles
while
they
swabbed
the
bathrooms
.

They
lived
mainly
in
the
kitchen
;
;

Unusual
in
a
case
like
this
,
but
''
--

''

``
I
read
it
,
yes
.

Kizzie
turned
to
go
inside
.

She
swung
around
.

You
told
me
to
bring
my
camera
.

I'm
not
going
back
''
--

``
Indeed
you
are
!
!

She
was
so
beautiful
,
so
valiant
,
so
pitiable
.

``
I'll
decide
that
when
I
get
there
.

I
was
so
cruel
to
Tolley
,
so
unfair
.

Let
none
but
Him
who
rules
the
thunder

It
was
simply
his
necessity
to
confess
which
had
made
him
write
and
keep
this
thing
.

``
You've
told
God
,
Frank
''
,
he
said
.

``
'
And
let
me
go
,
for
the
night
gathers
me
,
and
in
the
night
shall
no
man
gather
fruit
'
''
.

But
there
were
great
satisfactions
,
even
for
a
small
man
.

He
poured
his
thimble
of
wine
for
the
toast
he'd
made
so
often
.

He
could
put
a
stop
to
it
,
she
told
him
again
and
again
.

Another
weakness
--
far
more
irritating
than
his
manner
of
speaking
,
which
he
made
only
token
effort
to
change
--
was
his
devotion
to
that
old
horse
of
Tolley's
.

Her
horse
,
rather
.

But
Mr.
Robards'
now
,
oh
my
yes
,
indeed
,
yes
!
!

Gunny
symbolized
so
much
that
was
unpleasant
--
Tolley
,
the
indifference
with
which
the
Fairbrothers
and
indeed
the
whole
neighborhood
now
treated
her
and
which
she
would
die
rather
than
acknowledge
to
her
husband
,
his
lack
of
understanding
and
sympathy
in
her
present
condition
,
her
disgusting
swollen
stomach
.

Human
birth
was
no
novelty
to
Mr.
Robards
.

The
chances
were
against
his
being
here
to
humor
her
when
her
time
came
,
she
was
sure
.

Jenny
wished
now
that
she
had
had
Dr.
Dunne
,
feeling
that
somehow
he
wouldn't
have
allowed
the
dear
baby
to
turn
into
triplets
.

Now
she
must
be
thinking
of
a
boy-name
,
something
special
.

What
about
Royal
Robards
?
?

Roy
was
deeply
distressed
.

Of
course
she
wasn't
herself
right
now
,
but
as
her
strength
came
back
her
spirits
didn't
seem
to
rise
with
it
.

``
Don't
you
dare
!
!

Miss
Jen
was
funny
that
way
,
funny
that
she
didn't
seem
to
take
to
his
ideas
and
perk
up
.

He
was
downright
worried
about
her
,
but
there
was
one
more
thing
he
could
try
.

Her
hesitation
was
only
momentary
and
she
hoped
he
didn't
notice
it
,
as
she
settled
herself
,
asked
quickly
how
Miss
Jenny
and
the
babies
were
getting
on
.

``
See
for
yourself
,
Miss
Zion
.

She'll
relish
the
sight
of
a
friendly
face
.

Doaty
would
never
have
left
her
house
to
a
godless
woman
.

Perhaps
Doaty
had
guessed
already
and
kept
her
counsel
.

Their
childhood
would
have
been
quite
circumspect
without
Hetty's
flair
for
drama
,
especially
through
the
long
summers
.

Mama
had
died
before
the
corruption
of
the
family
circle
,
the
interruption
of
Charles
.

But
I
would
have
gone
anyway
,
thought
Henrietta
.

No
temptation
,
no
virtue
?
?

The
birds
were
really
awake
now
in
a
colloquy
of
music
,
and
light
was
beginning
to
creep
across
the
room
,
touching
sill
and
door
,
table
and
chair
and
all
of
Doaty's
flowers
in
their
artificial
blossom
and
leaf
.

After
the
sad
impatient
moment
,
waiting
for
comfort
which
could
not
come
,
she
slipped
out
of
bed
and
went
to
the
open
window
.

Leaning
out
,
she
could
see
a
tangle
of
rosebush
and
honeysuckle
,
one
not
quite
come
to
bloom
,
one
just
beyond
it
.

On
a
thrusting
spray
thick
with
thorns
and
dewdrops
and
swelling
pink
buds
,
like
a
summer
Valentine
,
a
bird
balanced
and
sang
,
nondescriptly
brown
and
alive
with
its
own
music
,
a
little
engine
of
song
.

Feeling
suddenly
neat
and
subdued
,
she
dressed
quite
soberly
and
went
downstairs
.

She
sounded
so
exactly
like
Doaty
that
Henrietta
obeyed
her
under
the
clear
impression
that
she
could
either
comply
or
stay
home
.

An
old
man
,
sitting
against
the
wall
of
a
cottage
and
waiting
for
the
sun
to
find
him
,
gave
her
a
more
than
reflective
look
as
she
passed
,
the
sap
still
plainly
rising
in
his
branches
.

``
I'm
taking
them
to
the
cemetery
''
,
said
Henrietta
,
out
of
a
vague
feeling
of
hospitality
.

He
straightened
himself
,
soldierly
against
the
wall
,
and
pulled
his
sprawled
feet
together
so
they
stood
side
by
side
in
their
old
boots
.

``
Rests
the
tissues
''
,
he
said
,
``
and
pacifies
the
system
.

My
dad
did
it
,
and
he
lived
to
a
great
age
''
.

She
did
suddenly
,
through
the
link
of
memory
with
his
father
,
old
Titus
,
who
must
have
been
in
his
nineties
when
Henrietta
ran
away
.

He
had
never
spoken
once
to
the
awed
sisters
,
but
his
son
had
been
friendly
,
a
big
fellow
of
fifty
or
more
,
a
fishing-boat
captain
and
powerful
like
the
sea
.

I
know
all
about
you
''
.

``
Can't
blame
a
man
for
leavin'
his
wife
''
,
he
said
quite
cheerfully
.

Man
in
a
boat
,
there's
a
lot
of
places
he
can
put
in
at
and
a
lot
of
reasons
he
can
be
away
for
a
bit
.

She
started
to
move
away
,
just
as
a
woman
came
out
of
the
cottage
,
a
big-boned
,
drab-haired
figure
with
a
clean
apron
tied
over
her
limp
print
dress
.

He
beat
the
air
with
his
stick
,
and
it
fell
from
his
claws
and
clattered
on
the
stones
.

``
It
ain't
an
idea
''
!
!

``
To
the
graveyard
.

``
Not
me
.

Come
on
now
''
.

He
mumbled
at
her
but
let
himself
be
led
off
inside
the
house
,
shuffling
mightily
to
make
it
clear
how
weak
and
aged
he
was
and
how
he
was
buffeted
about
by
those
who
still
had
their
wicked
strength
.

There
was
a
gabble
of
voices
from
indoors
,
young
hungry
sounds
like
cats
after
fish
,
and
a
burst
of
swearing
from
the
old
man
.

They
were
covered
with
tiny
white
blossoms
,
their
scant
roots
clawing
at
the
stony
ground
,
and
wild
birds
darted
in
and
about
and
through
them
so
they
were
nearly
alive
with
the
rustle
and
cry
.

She
felt
mindless
,
walking
,
and
almost
easy
until
the
church
spire
told
her
she
was
near
the
cemetery
,
and
she
caught
herself
wondering
what
she
would
say
to
Doaty
.

The
Momoyama
family
had
come
from
Miyagi
Prefecture
,
in
the
northeast
of
the
main
Japanese
island
of
Honshu
,
where
there
are
still
traces
of
the
mysterious
Ainu
strain
.

They
had
white
skins
and
blue
eyes
;
;

Tommy
Momoyama
was
one
of
these
fortunate
occasions
.

She
was
taller
than
most
Japanese
girls
,
and
had
the
exquisitely
willowy
form
of
the
Japanese
girl
who
is
lucky
enough
to
be
tall
.

She
had
been
in
Japan
just
one
week
.

Tommy
was
interested
in
psychiatry
,
because
there
was
much
an
understanding
nurse
could
do
to
help
the
patients
.

But
she
suffered
in
her
off-duty
hours
.

Such
as
now
,
when
she
sat
at
a
table
in
the
coffee
shop
at
the
Officers'
Club
,
having
coffee
and
a
hamburger
to
sustain
her
until
dinnertime
.

This
was
one
of
the
Navy's
crossroads
--
you
find
them
all
around
the
world
.

Ships
from
the
West
Coast
rotated
on
six-month
tours
of
duty
with
the
Seventh
Fleet
,
and
Yokosuka
was
the
Seventh
Fleet's
principal
port
for
maintenance
,
upkeep
and
shore
liberty
.

The
nice-looking
young
officer
fell
back
on
his
heels
,
open-mouthed
and
blushing
.

``
Oh
,
yes
--
you
had
ideas
''
!
!

He
muttered
,
and
took
off
,
obviously
feeling
like
a
fool
.

It
hadn't
been
this
way
in
college
,
or
in
nurses'
training
;
;

There
are
Spanish
girls
who
look
like
Tommy
Momoyama
,
brunettes
with
a
Moorish
hint
of
the
Orient
in
their
faces
;
;

there
are
beauties
from
the
Balkan
states
who
are
similarly
endowed
,
and
--
back
in
the
blessed
United
States
--
they
were
regarded
simply
as
pretty
women
.

She
looked
around
,
self-consciously
.

But
she
was
learning
that
so
long
as
she
was
in
this
country
,
and
wore
civilian
dress
in
the
Club
,
there
would
always
be
transient
young
men
who
would
approach
her
with
broken
English
.

There
had
been
occasions
when
some
of
the
more
experienced
had
even
addressed
her
in
what
might
have
been
perfectly
good
Japanese
.

There
was
more
to
service
in
the
Navy
Nurse
Corps
than
the
hours
in
the
ward
.

Now
there
was
raucous
male
singing
from
the
Fleet
Bar
.

It
was
terribly
off
key
,
and
poorly
done
,
and
Tommy
could
never
admit
to
herself
that
male
companionship
was
a
very
natural
and
important
thing
,
but
all
at
once
she
felt
lonesome
and
put-upon
.

she
got
out
of
the
coffee
shop
before
the
incident
could
be
repeated
.

Then
,
after
a
while
,
she
went
to
her
mirror
.

It
was
all
true
.

There
was
a
letter
to
write
to
her
mother
,
and
she
tried
to
make
its
tone
cheerful
.

And
tomorrow
she
would
take
time
to
shop
for
the
kimono
her
mother
wanted
to
present
to
the
young
wife
of
a
faculty
member
as
a
hostess
gown
.

There
had
never
been
a
good
reason
for
Doc
Doolittle
to
grow
up
.

He
was
doing
thirty
years
,
and
the
Navy
would
take
care
of
him
.

At
Yokosuka
he
was
restricted
to
the
confines
of
the
Base
because
Walt
Perry
,
being
thoughtful
,
knew
that
Doc
might
have
to
draw
some
medical
supplies
from
the
hospital
or
the
Supply
Base
.

Whitey
exclaimed
,
with
true
affection
.

We
live
down
by
the
Base
commissary
.

Wow
.

Strippers
,
but
scrumptious
,
and
Toodle
Williams
and
her
all-lesbian
band
''
.

He
laughed
and
laughed
.

``
You
see
''
,
she
said
,
looking
past
him
into
the
room
,
where
the
highball
glasses
sparkled
dully
in
the
bright
light
,
``
you
and
I
can't
understand
the
many
hardships
they
have
to
undergo
''
.

She
apparently
wasn't
satisfied
with
his
reaction
.

It
gave
her
a
lewd
,
winking
effect
.

She
asked
,
winking
wildly
.

People
don't
know
how
much
they
give
away
about
themselves
by
remarks
like
that
.

``
How
did
you
get
by
the
desk
''
?
?

Our
key
salesmen
are
in
appliances
and
cosmetics
''
.

I
have
an
appointment
''
.

``
You
haven't
been
listening
to
what
I've
been
telling
you
.

All
,
of
course
,
except
the
Donner
party
who
were
bent
on
starving
to
death
.

``
What
you
need
is
a
steady
martingale
''
,
the
cowboy
announced
after
watching
Owen
play
.

I'm
always
trying
to
find
a
breaking
table
in
blackjack
.

Don't
you
have
to
spend
any
time
on
your
ranch
''
?
?

When
he
looked
in
the
back
,
Mrs.
Gertrude
Parker
was
marking
keno
cards
.

he
studied
the
pistol
exhibition
that
Hurrays
featured
as
an
added
attraction
.

Buzz
had
on
a
Hawaiian
shirt
and
was
carrying
some
sun-tan
oil
and
dark
glasses
.

``
Something
about
the
pollen
''
.

``
Well
,
okay
''
,
Buzz
said
.

``
How's
your
luck
,
honey
''
?
?

``
Stake
me
''
,
she
said
,
``
and
let
me
at
those
dice
.

``
If
you
go
broke
''
,
she
said
,
smiling
up
at
him
,
``
I'll
leave
you
''
.

Alexander
said
,
``
Answer
me
properly
,
Spencer
''
.

Alexander
walked
away
.

During
the
morning
hours
,
it
became
clear
that
the
arrest
of
Spencer
was
having
no
sobering
effect
upon
the
men
of
the
Somers
.

``
More
arrests
,
I
fear
''
.

``
Cromwell
,
of
course
.

The
aimless
milling
about
of
what
had
been
a
well-trained
,
well-organized
crew
struck
Alexander
with
horror
.

Adrien
Deslonde
hastened
to
Alexander's
side
.

I
saw
him
myself
and
it
was
done
after
consultation
with
Cromwell
.

Then
,
with
disappointment
evident
upon
their
faces
,
they
moved
to
the
work
.

In
the
tiny
cabin
,
Alexander
met
with
Gansevoort
,
Heiser
and
Wales
to
speak
and
to
listen
.

``
That
would
be
worse
than
useless
''
,
Alexander
broke
in
.

``
There
is
not
space
to
hold
or
force
to
guard
any
increased
number
of
prisoners
.

Do
you
not
think
these
men
might
choose
the
black
flag
here
and
now
''
?
?

All
that
is
needed
is
for
one
man
to
feel
self-confident
enough
to
take
the
lead
.

We
are
going
to
be
rushed
and
murdered
''
.

``
We
are
going
to
bring
the
Somers
into
New
York
harbor
safe
and
sound
''
.

``
Of
course
,
I
agree
with
the
Captain
''
,
Gansevoort
said
thoughtfully
,
``
but
the
conspiracy
is
ferocious
and
desperate
.

Those
of
us
present
,
the
Perry
brothers
,
Deslonde
and
the
other
midshipmen
now
have
the
responsibility
of
the
Somers
.

And
when
he
was
alone
again
in
the
cabin
,
Alexander
lowered
his
head
into
his
arms
and
wept
,
for
he
knew
full
well
what
must
be
done
,
what
in
the
end
would
be
done
.

It
was
given
or
it
was
not
given
.

One
did
one's
best
and
if
fortune
frowned
,
an
eighteen-year-old
boy
with
murder
in
his
heart
sailed
aboard
one's
ship
.

It
was
for
love
that
he
had
served
the
Navy
.

And
after
a
while
,
he
dried
his
tears
and
walked
the
deck
as
a
captain
should
with
assurance
and
dignity
.

``
Yes
,
sir
.

Alexander
shifted
his
gaze
to
Spencer
.

His
eyes
went
back
to
contemplation
of
the
sea
.

``
I
thought
''
,
Midshipman
Rogers
had
told
Alexander
,
``
that
Spencer
was
teaching
him
geometry
''
.

This
was
a
training
ship
and
the
training
would
continue
,
but
there
was
an
element
of
frightful
absurdity
here
which
Alexander
recognized
.

I
was
suddenly
conscious
of
my
bare
arms
.

His
hands
were
swinging
at
his
sides
,
and
he
passed
through
the
dingy
market
place
with
his
back
straight
and
,
pivoting
on
his
heel
,
he
entered
an
old
stone
building
.

Rachel
had
seen
me
watching
the
young
man
.

She
smiled
.

``
When
your
mother
was
here
he
must
have
been
a
young
boy
.

I
swallowed
hard
and
looked
down
at
my
feet
plodding
along
beside
Rachel
.

Rachel
said
that
schools
and
synagogues
occupied
most
of
the
buildings
.

We
entered
one
where
the
front
door
stood
ajar
and
climbed
a
flight
of
steep
steps
to
the
main
floor
.

His
toes
pointed
out
toward
the
walls
.

We
stepped
inside
.

Each
boy
opened
his
small
mouth
wide
and
rocked
back
and
forth
on
the
bench
in
the
way
his
grandfather
and
great-grandfather
had
studied
and
prayed
in
the
ghettos
of
Europe
.

In
the
center
of
his
brilliant
curls
sat
a
small
black
skullcap
.

His
head
barely
rose
above
the
table
.

I
could
not
keep
my
eyes
away
from
the
boy
with
the
red
hair
.

``
All
day
''
,
she
said
.

The
old
man
in
the
baggy
clothes
waited
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
.

He
glanced
down
into
his
beard
and
muttered
something
in
Yiddish
.

I
reached
into
the
pocket
of
my
skirt
,
fingered
ten
pruta
,
and
dropped
the
coin
.

I
didn't
look
at
him
.

You
had
to
be
stupid
or
crazy
or
immortal
.

I
was
American
.

Rachel
faced
me
.

She
wished
to
change
much
for
the
children
here
''
.

Rachel
clicked
her
tongue
behind
her
teeth
.

But
when
she
saw
the
children
you
have
just
visited
,
she
wanted
to
take
them
away
and
put
them
out
in
the
country
,
in
the
kibbutzim
.

When
she
loved
,
it
was
with
a
passion
that
drove
her
along
and
carried
along
with
her
those
things
she
loved
.

Nothing
was
too
impossible
for
her
to
do
when
she
wanted
.

If
she
could
not
take
the
children
out
of
this
section
,
at
least
she
could
take
other
children
out
of
their
countries
and
put
them
on
the
farms
.

She
set
out
to
make
sure
that
no
Jewish
child
anyplace
in
the
world
had
to
live
in
a
place
such
as
this
''
.

I
said
quietly
,
gaining
nerve
,
ready
to
ask
any
question
at
all
,
no
matter
how
intimate
,
ready
to
be
rebuffed
,
``
Then
why
did
she
leave
Israel
?
?

I'd
like
to
know
that
very
much
''
.

She
pursed
her
lips
,
then
clamped
them
together
so
tightly
that
I
thought
she
was
angry
with
me
.

But
she
sighed
and
her
face
relaxed
.

She
had
good
friends
here
,
people
who
liked
her
.

She
worked
very
hard
.

Yet
he
walked
like
a
young
man
.

Then
his
son
did
something
''
--
Rachel
threw
up
her
hands
--
``
I
don't
know
what
,
but
something
,
to
an
official
here
--
it
was
during
the
Mandate
--
and
the
son
was
imprisoned
.

A
few
hours
after
the
son
was
arrested
,
your
mother
was
informed
.

We
were
sitting
together
,
talking
.

I
asked
her
if
she
would
,
and
she
said
she
would
not
.

She
let
him
lead
her
around
.

He
took
her
to
a
doctor
,
for
she
was
run
down
,
nervous
,
did
not
care
where
she
was
.

he
did
not
let
her
choose
her
own
food
.

The
two
of
them
against
the
world
.

And
the
bed
that
sagged
in
a
certain
place
where
all
the
weight
had
been
put
too
many
times
before
and
the
walls
fine
and
thin
for
overhearing
talk
in
the
next
room
when
Gratt
went
out
for
ice
,
the
sound
coming
through
the
walls
like
something
on
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
,
so
you
knew
they
heard
you
when
they
were
quiet
and
while
you
lay
wondering
what
they
had
heard
you
listened
.

And
Gratt
Shafer
would
be
in
Memphis
today
for
the
wedding
rehearsal
and
then
tomorrow
he
would
marry
just
like
everybody
knew
he
would
,
just
like
everybody
knew
all
along
.

So
you
sit
in
the
car
and
listen
to
the
air
run
out
and
listen
to
the
rain
and
see
the
mud
in
front
of
the
headlights
,
waiting
for
you
,
for
your
new
spectator
pumps
,
waiting
for
you
to
squat
by
yourself
out
there
in
your
tight
skirt
,
crying
and
afraid
and
trying
to
get
that
damned
son-of-a-bitch
tire
off
,
because
that
is
being
an
old
maid
too
,
if
you
happen
to
drive
a
car
,
it
is
changing
the
tire
yourself
in
the
night
,
and
in
the
mud
and
the
rain
,
hating
to
get
out
in
it
but
afraid
to
stay
and
afraid
to
try
to
walk
out
for
help
.

He
can
even
be
a
mild-voiced
little-town
guy
with
big-town
ideas
and
level
gray
eyes
and
a
heart
even
Houdini
couldn't
figure
out
,
how
it
is
unlocked
.

And
I'll
take
you
with
me
.

You
feel
where
he
is
and
what
he
sees
,
and
at
night
you
feel
when
he
is
asleep
or
with
the
other
woman
,
the
one
that
never
could
love
him
the
way
you
do
,
the
one
who
got
him
because
she
didn't
particularly
give
a
damn
whether
she
got
him
or
didn't
.

You
think
:
``
Did
he
feel
that
way
about
me
''
?
?

You
laughed
and
then
your
chest
swelled
and
you
felt
you
could
cry
for
a
little
bit
,
and
then
a
feeling
hit
you
like
a
chill
in
your
stomach
and
the
goose
bumps
rippled
along
your
arm
.

He
hit
the
theme
about
dying
to
defend
your
country
,
and
you
were
ready
to
do
it
right
then
,
without
a
second
thought
.

While
he
talked
you
wouldn't
trade
being
a
West
Tennessee
farmer
for
being
anything
else
in
the
whole
damned
world
,
no
matter
if
it
hadn't
,
in
six
weeks
,
rained
enough
to
wet
a
rat's
ass
.

A
lock
on
the
toilet
would
encourage
malingering
and
primping
.

She
could
not
count
the
times
Herman
had
rapped
on
the
door
,
just
a
couple
of
bangs
that
shook
the
whole
damned
closet
and
might
,
someday
,
break
away
the
pipe
connections
from
the
wall
.

And
the
hours
were
six-thirty
in
the
morning
until
eleven
at
night
on
Saturdays
and
during
sales
,
and
there
were
no
chairs
and
you
couldn't
smoke
and
the
cooling
was
overhead
fans
and
there
was
no
porter
or
janitor
.

He
also
drew
precise
crisp
spots
,
which
he
sold
to
various
literary
and
artistic
journals
,
The
New
Yorker
,
for
instance
,
or
Esquire
.

McKenzie
,
the
art
editor
,
took
one
look
at
my
finished
sketch
and
said
,
``
Nothing
doing
,
Rufus
.

He
said
,
``
That
may
be
,
but
it
isn't
authentic
the
way
readers
think
.

Not
much
;
;

It
was
strange
stuff
--
it
reminded
me
of
the
pictures
of
a
child
,
but
a
child
who
has
never
played
with
other
kids
and
has
lived
all
its
life
with
adults
.

We
used
to
kid
him
by
saying
he
only
painted
that
way
because
he
was
so
nearsighted
.

Mrs.
Monmouth
thought
of
him
as
her
discovery
,
and
she
paid
two
to
three
hundred
dollars
for
a
painting
.

Attending
the
life
class
was
my
idea
--
or
rather
,
Askington's
idea
,
but
I
was
ripe
for
it
,
and
the
other
two
wouldn't
have
gone
if
I
hadn't
talked
them
into
it
.

I
wanted
to
paint
again
.

I
hadn't
done
a
serious
picture
in
almost
a
year
.

It
wasn't
just
the
pressure
of
work
,
although
that
was
the
excuse
I
often
used
,
even
to
myself
.

I
had
admired
him
long
before
I
talked
to
him
.

The
night
we
first
met
,
at
one
of
Mrs.
Monmouth's
giant
parties
,
he
was
wearing
a
brown
cashmere
jacket
with
silver
buttons
and
a
soft
pink
Viyella
shirt
;
;

instead
of
a
necktie
he
wore
a
leather
bolo
drawn
through
a
golden
ring
in
which
was
set
a
lump
of
pale
pure
jade
.

Life
had
included
him
in
its
``
Modern
American
Artists
''
series
and
had
photographed
him
at
his
studio
in
the
East
Sixties
;
;

``
By
yourself
''
?
?

I
asked
.

just
listening
to
him
made
me
feel
intelligent
.

``
Maybe
you
know
him
.

``
I'm
also
studying
enameling
with
Hajime
Iijima
''
,
he
went
on
,
``
and
twice
a
week
I
go
to
a
life
class
taught
by
Pendleton
''
.

``
Osric
Pendleton
''
?
?

I
said
.

I've
always
admired
him
,
and
when
I
heard
he
was
taking
a
few
pupils
,
I
went
to
him
and
joined
his
class
''
.

That's
one
of
the
reasons
art
is
becoming
a
useless
occupation
.

A
bunch
of
amateur
dervishes
!
!

In
a
way
,
Askington
was
right
.

``
Stimulating
''
was
the
word
for
it
.

Why
should
this
suddenly
assail
her
?
?

I
don't
even
own
the
house
I'm
standing
in
.

I
was
so
sure
it
was
all
temporary
that
we
would
all
embrace
,
and
then
the
lawyer
would
tear
up
all
those
things

I
suppose
I
should
have
paid
attention
to
that
half-murmured
remark
,
but
it
seemed
one
of
those
extreme
statements
women
under
stress
indulge
in
.

At
last
,
I
thought
,
she's
recovering
her
spirits
.

In
the
morning
the
fog
was
still
thick
so
that
to
go
to
the
village
I
crept
along
with
my
headlights
full
on
.

Why
,
when
I
drove
down
to
church
,
didn't
it
speak
to
me
,
seeing
the
lights
still
on
and
the
day
crisp
and
clear
?
?

When
I
came
back
from
church
at
noon
Mrs.
Thaxter
was
turning
into
the
Salter
driveway
.

And
she
.

Why
didn't
that
alarm
me
then
?
?

I
had
made
a
habit
of
calling
her
at
night
from
my
cottage
,
just
to
check
.

Hanging
on
and
on
past
any
man's
patience
some
final
stab
of
conclusion
?
?

But
I
didn't
really
think
it
was
as
simple
as
that
,
nor
did
anyone
else
.

Was
it
a
hysterical
release
from
the
long
strain
of
vigilance
of
those
weeks
?
?

I
knew
''
!
!

Was
that
what
had
given
way
in
me
?
?

I
added
.

Yes
,
I
had
cried
out
that
I
knew
she'd
do
it
,
but
without
my
fully
realizing
it
at
the
time
,
it
was
a
cry
of
triumph
for
her
,
praise
at
her
deliverance
from
pettiness
and
greed
--
and
guilt
.

She
was
finally
at
rest
in
truth
,
of
her
own
proud
free
choice
.

Mr.
Salter
came
home
.

The
funeral
service
was
in
the
house
,
the
Methodist
minister
,
how
clean
and
glistening
his
eyeglasses
and
his
neat
body
standing
beside
that
coffin
with
that
doll
inside
,
a
stranger
speaking
to
strangers
the
old
sacred
words
,
and
the
rain
drumming
incessantly
in
accompaniment
,
seven
days
of
relentless
rain
that
turned
the
ground
to
mud
so
the
burial
had
to
be
postponed
.

I
waited
.

Then
Via
called
to
say
they
had
decided
to
cremate
her
--
as
they
had
Ellen
,
the
thought
leaped
to
my
mind
--
and
did
I
want
to
meet
her
at
the
funeral
home
the
next
morning
.

I
knelt
,
just
for
decency
I
thought
at
the
time
,
but
found
myself
whispering
,
``
Our
Father
which
Art
in
Heaven
''
And
it
was
only
after
that
that
something
unlocked
in
me
and
I
felt
a
grief
.

``
I
had
a
rather
small
place
of
my
own
.

``
Umm
,
uhhu
''
.

``
Are
your
people
still
alive
''
?
?

``
You
seem
to
have
read
so
much
,
you
have
a
natural
gift
for
words
''
,
he
added
,
trying
to
flatter
her
vanity
.

``
You
must
have
been
good
at
history
at
school
.

Where
did
you
go
to
school
''
?
?

Would
you
be
happier
if
I
made
up
some
stories
about
my
life
,
told
you
some
lies
?
?

``
Well
,
all
right
then
''
.

Was
she
just
naturally
sloppy
about
everything
but
her
physical
appearance
?
?

He
wondered
.

Nothing
at
all
''
,
he
said
quietly
.

Look
at
them
''
.

``
They're
an
expensive
English
shoe
for
walking
around
a
lot
.

``
I'll
get
an
elegant
pair
of
thin-soled
Italian
shoes
tomorrow
,
Carla
''
.

``
There's
a
church
you
should
see
''
,
she
said
.

All
evening
she
was
eloquent
and
pleased
with
herself
.

It
was
a
good
thing
that
she
clung
to
her
religion
,
he
thought
.

Aren't
you
going
out
to
mass
?
?

You
could
take
me
to
St.
Peter's
''
.

But
where
?
?

A
half
hour
later
he
got
her
up
to
go
out
for
breakfast
so
the
Ferraros
,
hearing
them
hurrying
down
the
stairs
,
would
think
they
were
going
to
a
late
mass
.

``
Why
not
''
?
?

Watching
her
,
he
felt
like
a
spectator
at
a
tennis
game
,
with
the
ball
being
bounced
back
and
forth
.

Did
many
of
Sam's
countrymen
live
in
boxcars
in
the
bush
?
?

An
intellectual
.

It
was
said
that
he
had
had
a
vision
.

Agnese
had
been
sitting
quietly
,
listening
with
the
serenity
of
the
unaware
.

Nodding
approvingly
and
swelling
with
importance
,
the
old
lady
whispered
confidentially
.

There
would
be
changes
made
,
and
Signor
Raymond
should
understand
that
when
the
Pope
died
it
was
like
the
end
of
a
regime
in
Rome
.

Jobs
would
be
lost
and
new
faces
would
become
prominent
.

Surely
she
could
see
that
these
women
were
her
Italians
,
too
,
he
thought
.

``
It
means
so
much
to
her
.

In
her
dark
,
scornful
fashion
she
proceeded
to
her
destination
,
afraid
of
nothing
,
not
even
the
evil
spirits
which
kept
her
company
in
her
time
of
bleeding
.

His
breath
caught
,
and
,
trembling
,
he
closed
his
eyes
and
stumbled
off
.

Then
he
fled
,
not
waiting
to
see
if
she
minded
him
or
took
notice
of
his
cry
.

Early
Spring
came
from
her
bed
,
from
beside
her
half-drunk
husband
,
Walitzee
,
and
stood
at
the
entrance
way
to
her
lodge
hearing
the
mild
commotion
,
the
sound
of
hushed
voices
.

``
Go
take
helsq'iyokom
,
your
evil
spirit
,
to
the
young
boys
''
,
the
woman
said
.

I
will
not
let
your
evil
in
.

The
other
women
had
come
close
now
,
their
voices
murmuring
together
until
they
stood
buzzing
in
an
angry
knot
,
their
threats
mingling
,
rising
,
nagging
at
each
other
,
each
trying
to
make
her
indignation
and
anger
felt
.

They
picked
up
sticks
and
hurled
them
at
the
girl
.

But
she
did
not
move
,
taking
the
words
and
the
sticks
in
that
old
defiance
of
her
extreme
youth
until
suddenly
Pile
of
Clouds
came
howling
among
them
,
swinging
a
great
bullhide
whip
.

Is
it
for
me
to
be
forbidden
the
flesh
you
made
grow
on
me
?
?

She
stared
at
the
pale
tracings
on
the
tree
,
hearing
her
breath
refracted
from
it
,
her
face
close
and
touching
at
time
the
rough
edges
of
the
bark
.

He
ranted
and
prophesied
the
doom
of
his
enemies
,
walking
in
circles
in
and
out
of
his
living
place
,
drinking
stolen
whisky
in
great
,
gasping
draughts
until
finally
,
incoherent
and
sick
,
he
fell
into
his
own
oblivion
.

They
went
into
the
sun
together
and
paraded
grandly
in
their
war
clothes
,
painting
their
faces
with
the
sacred
attis
dug
far
off
in
the
cave
of
skeletons
.

And
a
very
young
one
,
Swan
Necklace
,
tried
to
emulate
them
and
followed
timidly
.

Yellow
Wolf
was
there
,
nephew
of
the
young
chief
by
an
older
brother
long
dead
,
in
whom
also
the
disordered
chemistries
of
youth
worked
.

He
felt
so
much
like
laughing
;
;

even
like
shouting
and
crying
out
from
the
hilltops
from
which
he
could
descend
as
an
eagle
in
a
mad
caper
from
the
cliffs
.

He
and
Sarpsis
planned
a
great
parade
with
the
young
men
.

She
smiled
,
and
expertly
let
herself
downward
,
holding
this
known
root
or
that
,
her
sneakers
sliding
in
the
leaves
.

Only
--
only
--
her
thoughts
were
a
little
strange
.

And
then
off
he
went
so
casually
,
to
someone
else
with
breasts
better
developed
,
more
obvious
in
a
lower-cut
dress
,
someone
without
a
mouthful
of
wire
bands
and
an
inability
to
find
words
that
would
hold
him
.

Oh
God
!
!

I
wish
so
much
someone
loved
me
.

but
of
course
the
impossible
effort
of
leaving
would
have
to
be
made
on
this
Monday
morning
.

This
room
was
like
a
prison
.

Below
him
,
as
if
at
the
end
of
some
remote
tunnel
,
he
heard
the
humming
of
a
vacuum
cleaner
.

They
had
left
both
of
his
eyes
uncovered
.

He
drank
a
glass
of
water
and
gripped
the
sink
with
both
hands
.

She
must
have
put
his
clothes
in
the
closet
.

He
found
a
lump
rising
in
his
throat
because
of
that
one
simple
act
of
tidiness
.

He
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
.

What
time
was
it
?
?

He
peered
at
his
wristwatch
.

He
rose
slowly
and
looked
into
the
mirror
on
the
inside
of
the
closet
door
.

The
surface
,
however
,
was
perfectly
white
.

He
was
supposed
to
be
in
court
this
afternoon
,
at
City
Hall
.

``
Is
that
you
,
Father
?
?

Who's
there
''
?
?

``
Gosh
!
!

You
shouldn't
be
up
,
should
you
''
?
?

``
No
.

That's
my
wish
.

Or
maybe
a
drink
''
?
?

She
asked
,
in
a
way
that
seemed
oddly
sophisticated
,
considerate
,
and
yet
perhaps
partly
scornful
.

``
Not
to
anyone
''
?
?

``
No
--
please
.

``
All
right
''
She
was
staring
at
him
.

She
had
disappeared
.

I
wouldn't
have
the
strength
to
answer
,
he
thought
.

He
saw
the
suitcase
,
which
Julia
was
holding
.

He
stood
up
.

``
I'll
take
that
,
Julie
--
for
you
''
.

``
Oh
no
''
,
she
said
.

She
went
ahead
of
him
.

To
the
manner
born
--
odd
to
have
such
a
thought
at
a
time
like
this
;
;

yet
her
inflection
seemed
forced
or
rehearsed
.

He
took
her
hand
.

She
said
nothing
until
Pietro
had
slackened
their
pace
.

He
could
see
the
stone
building
where
he
lived
.

Yes
,
there
was
the
key
.

``
Are
you
positive
you'll
be
all
right
by
yourself
''
?
?

You
,
also
.

Don't
work
too
hard
''
.

He
should
have
discovered
a
more
tender
farewell
.

Will
you
look
at
George
Rawlings
!
!

Tell
Sam
not
to
worry
about
the
car
.

Too
bad
a
jury
isn't
involved
.

He's
got
all
the
facts
.

What
?
?

No
,
darling
I'd
rather
you
didn't
come
out
''
.

''

yet
if
he
said
:
Make
an
excuse
yourself
,
come
out
here
today
,
she
would
have
been
on
the
next
train
--
and
,
similarly
,
if
she
had
been
in
need
,
he
would
have
gone
to
her
.

``
Come
,
come
''
,
Jim
said
,
jollying
Lucy
a
little
.

Jim's
fine
young
face
was
an
expressive
one
,
too
;
;

And
will
it
be
only
a
couple
of
weeks
?
?

but
she
had
stayed
all
winter
,
and
Cathy
had
stayed
all
winter
too
--
with
them
.

``
But
she
promised
--
This
will
be
different
''
,
he
said
at
last
.

``
You've
got
to
admit
she
was
smart
to
scare
up
this
fine
government
job
over
there
--
she'll
get
a
home
for
herself
and
Cathy
in
no
time
.

It
was
not
that
she
disliked
Cathy
.

He
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
shouted
up
,
fiercely
,
``
Susan
!
!

Was
it
only
a
few
nights
ago
that
they
had
been
standing
together
in
front
of
the
house
looking
at
the
moon-washed
river
?
?

Susan
looked
like
an
overwhelmed
baby
nurse
;
;

``
Do
you
need
that
big
bundle
''
?
?

Susan
stared
at
him
with
hurt
blue
eyes
that
gushed
an
instant
grief
;
;

The
handsome
bird
was
solitary
;
;

its
mate
must
be
at
home
,
silently
guarding
their
nest
.

among
them
,
she
had
to
prepare
the
guest
room
.

How
long
would
it
be
occupied
?
?

In
the
sunshine
of
late
afternoon
,
Lucy
stood
looking
at
the
ready
guest
room
.

There
were
new
yellow
curtains
,
bright
as
a
child's
life
ought
to
be
,
a
new
bedspread
,
lively
with
hopping
rabbits
,
and
hanging
from
the
ceiling
was
an
airy
Mother
Goose
Mobile
,
spinning
slowly
in
the
breeze
.

The
closet
was
faintly
fragrant
with
lavender
,
and
as
Lucy
shut
the
door
an
unhappy
memory
slipped
into
her
mind
,
like
a
lavender
ghost
:
Greg's
house
,
on
the
day
he
was
buried
,
and
the
child
,
pale
,
silent
,
baffled
,
watching
the
funeral
guests
with
panicky
eyes
.

When
she
picked
up
the
receiver
,
her
mother's
cheerful
voice
was
there
.

I'd
have
phoned
sooner
but
I've
been
busy
''
.

for
Mother
to
be
able
to
call
,
Susan
must
be
napping
now
,
surrounded
by
her
multitude
of
dolls
.

``
How
was
Cathy
''
?
?

Just
before
Myra
left
--
She
was
saying
good-by
to
Cathy
,
and
she
didn't
realize
I
was
near
''
.

She
hesitated
,
as
though
hunting
over
words
and
ways
of
putting
them
.

``
Cathy
was
in
tears
,
of
course
,
and
I
heard
Myra
say
,
'
Now
be
good
,
and
at
Christmastime
I'll
send
you
a
wonderful
present
from
Paris
'
''
.

Shocked
speechless
,
Lucy
sat
there
.

She's
not
going
to
get
away
with
it
.

they
would
have
to
buy
things
for
her
.

For
eleven
days
they'd
done
the
same
thing
,
leaving
the
cottage
quietly
before
breakfast
,
before
Esperanza
Beach
got
jammed
with
tourists
and
beach
balls
and
show-offy
lifeguards
.

They
walked
slowly
past
the
sherbet-colored
cottages
--
eleven
lemon
,
nine
mint
,
seven
orange
--
around
the
curve
to
a
deserted
stand
with
an
``
Eats
''
sign
jiggling
in
the
wind
.

Nobody
around
.

Here
he
was
enclosed
and
safe
.

Every
night
when
he
wanted
a
drink
of
water
,
didn't
he
practice
being
fearless
by
not
turning
on
the
bathroom
light
?
?

Or
,
what
was
worse
,
she
prayed
for
him
out
loud
at
bedtime
:
``
Please
,
Lord
Gord
,
please
give
my
brother
the
strength
to
go
swimming
like
he
promised
''
.

``
Goolick
,
goooolick
''
,
creaked
a
sea
gull
.

I
can't
go
in
.

``
Is
''
.

Her
cough
sounded
like
cloth
ripping
.

``
You
shouldn't
smoke
so
much
''
,
he
said
,
unconsciously
imitating
Victoria's
holier-than-thou
voice
.

Dr.
Fortman
says
if
I
exercise
my
leg
more
,
maybe
I
can
use
a
cane
when
I'm
big
''
.

``
A
cane's
mighty
handy
.

Quint
glared
.

He
always
did
when
people
asked
.

I
come
early
in
the
morning
''
.

``
So
do
I
.

They
met
next
morning
and
all
the
mornings
thereafter
.

Personally
,
I
prefer
straight
hair
like
yours
,
but
as
they
say
on
the
Continent
,
'
What
can
one
do
'
''
?
?

then
they
scraped
off
the
mold
and
made
fish
soup
.

Pugh
.

Camels
in
Tripoli
had
harelips
.

Artfully
,
as
the
days
went
by
,
he
found
occasion
to
tell
her
that
his
father
had
won
the
Navy
Cross
in
the
Korean
War
;
;

that
his
baby
sister
could
spit
up
through
her
nose
when
she
felt
like
it
;
;

that
he
personally
had
an
IQ
of
141
and
was
currently
reading
the
Mushr
to
Ozon
volume
of
the
encyclopedia
.

Let's
get
dressed
up
--
the
doctor's
taking
us
out
tonight
''
.

Her
face
turned
pink
with
pleasure
and
a
smothered
cough
.

Fifteen
days
early
--
isn't
that
wonderful
''
?
?

A
cave
seemed
to
be
opening
in
Quint's
stomach
.

Quint
closed
the
screen
door
quietly
so
Maggie
wouldn't
be
scared
.

The
cave
in
his
stomach
hurt
.

He
had
to
go
into
the
water
.

It
had
started
two
years
ago
when
he
was
in
an
iron
lung
.

The
first
time
the
nurse
took
him
out
of
the
lung
,
she
said
if
he
got
frightened
,
she'd
put
him
back
for
a
second
.

Linda
looked
remote
yet
lovely
in
black
,
and
everyone
held
his
or
her
breath
.

Hadn't
Linda
been
a
perfect
wife
to
Bobbie
,
who
was
the
least
bit
of
a
disappointment
all
these
years
?
?

Wasn't
John
Cooper
even
more
attractive
at
forty-seven
than
he
had
been
twenty-five
years
earlier
?
?

And
wasn't
John's
wife
,
Edythe
,
even
more
appalling
,
if
possible
?
?

Everybody
knew
that
John
Cooper
had
married
Edythe
on
the
rebound
.

Mousie
Chandler
had
been
to
school
with
her
someplace
near
Baltimore
and
tried
to
explain
rather
than
defend
her
to
the
gang
having
lunch
at
Horne's
.

Bobbie
and
Linda
looked
magnificent
at
their
wedding
.

``
Poor
John
''
!
!

Others
thought
he
couldn't
stand
seeing
Linda
,
Mrs.
Bobbie
Evans
,
still
so
beautiful
,
so
much
in
command
of
everything
.

Being
an
intelligent
man
,
John
must
have
guessed
what
everyone
thought
about
Edythe
,
but
he
never
let
on
by
so
much
as
a
brave
smile
.

Poor
John
was
the
kind
of
stock
that
keeps
a
bargain
without
whimpering
and
maybe
bends
over
backward
to
keep
a
bad
one
.

after
the
war
back
to
the
heir
apparency
of
the
steel
company
.

Bobbie
had
been
successful
,
too
,
though
he
didn't
match
John's
pace
,
and
after
all
he
didn't
need
to
,
with
all
the
Stuart
money
.

It
might
be
rough
on
Edythe
at
first
,
but
Linda
and
John
between
them
could
make
a
settlement
handsome
enough
to
soothe
her
,
to
send
her
back
to
Cleveland
or
anywhere
.

Years
of
watching
while
Poor
John
struggled
without
the
help
and
understanding
of
the
kind
of
wife
a
man
needed
to
get
ahead
.

Lord
knows
I
had
everything
set
for
you
''
.

He
didn't
tell
her
of
the
long
board
meeting
where
Bobbie
and
John
were
weighed
one
against
the
other
.

Most
of
the
directors
nodded
.

``
That's
swell
''
,
I
said
sweetly
.

In
some
ways
it
was
worth
being
out
the
money
--
just
knowing
I
was
no
longer
obligated
to
Nadine
!
!

It
was
past
midnight
and
we
were
in
bed
when
the
phone
rang
.

I
answered
to
find
Nadine
at
the
other
end
.

``
What's
wrong
''
?
?

Old
Mr.
Thom
is
already
down
on
Wally
,
and
we
simply
can't
afford
to
get
Ken
mad
at
us
''
--

I
was
all
set
for
what
came
next
.

Why
should
I
go
over
at
midnight
to
check
on
Francie
,
when
her
parents
didn't
care
enough
to
leave
a
party
?
?

``
Fifteen
minutes
,
then
!
!

I
drove
off
through
the
cool
darkness
to
Nadine's
apartment
and
rang
the
bell
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
a
young
girl
opened
the
door
.

``
It's
all
right
''
,
I
said
,
as
she
started
to
look
scared
.

I
just
came
over
to
make
sure
everything
was
all
right
''
.

``
I'm
--
hard
to
wake
up
''
,
she
faltered
.

She
didn't
look
over
thirteen
.

There
was
a
ragged
edge
to
her
voice
now
,
as
if
she'd
been
crying
.

``
Wally's
drunk
--
I'll
get
him
out
of
here
as
soon
as
I
possibly
can
,
but
I
don't
want
Shirley
to
see
him
like
this
.

The
receiver
clicked
in
my
ear
.

He
lurched
and
stumbled
to
the
davenport
and
sank
down
on
it
,
and
was
instantly
asleep
.

And
the
other
people
there
were
listening
!
!

``
Tea
,
''
Nadine
screeched
.

I
had
done
all
I
was
going
to
do
.

Whether
or
not
Wally
lost
his
job
was
no
concern
of
mine
.

I
snuggled
up
close
to
him
--
loving
him
--
thankful
for
a
man
like
him
.

Seems
that
the
kid
Wally
had
hired
had
a
repair
business
of
his
own
going
on
the
side
.

And
I
was
plastered
and
I
blew
my
stack
''
--

``
And
told
him
right
to
his
face
he'd
never
slept
with
a
woman
''
!
!

``
Things
may
smooth
over
yet
''
,
Chris
said
,
his
nice
lean
face
grave
with
honest
concern
.

When
A
bubble
breaks
,
there's
nothing
.

``
I'm
glad
you
feel
that
way
,
honey
.

We
can
let
them
move
in
with
us
''
--

Something
I
had
simply
never
thought
of
.

I
just
stared
at
him
.

It
was
incredible
--
He
gave
me
an
embarrassed
,
pleading
look
.

``
You're
too
lazy
to
go
out
and
look
for
another
job
.

But
it
couldn't
go
on
forever
--
A
couple
of
weeks
,
Chris
had
said
.

He
set
out
every
morning
looking
for
work
,
and
come
home
around
noon
,
full
of
alibis
and
excuses
.

I
don't
really
believe
in
intuition
.

It
was
just
going
to
be
one
of
those
days
.

For
the
thousandth
time
,
I
wished
I'd
chosen
some
nice
,
nine-to-five
,
five-days-a-week
profession
.

I
had
a
lot
to
be
thankful
for
.

Growing
up
without
a
mother
from
the
time
she
was
three
--
it
wasn't
a
good
thing
for
a
child
,
even
knowing
the
kind
of
mother
Alice
had
been
.

Her
first
class
wasn't
until
ten
,
but
she
always
got
up
to
have
breakfast
with
me
.

It
made
me
feel
good
and
knowing
that
she'd
decided
,
all
on
her
own
,
to
go
to
college
right
here
in
town
made
me
feel
good
,
too
.

The
boys
were
already
waiting
in
the
corridor
outside
my
office
when
I
got
to
Fairview
.

I'm
Chief
of
Medicine
here
and
this
morning
would
start
like
all
others
,
with
me
taking
the
boys
on
the
rounds
.

Pete
was
down
on
Seven
,
Dick
told
me
,
and
he'd
meet
us
there
.

``
Got
a
new
one
in
last
night
''
,
he
said
.

The
ward
was
a
small
one
,
four
beds
,
kept
reserved
for
female
alcoholics
.

This
was
one
time
I'd
have
gladly
broken
my
own
rule
,
but
habit
was
too
strong
.

``
Your
period
''
?
?

``
Better
do
a
Papanicolaou
''
,
I
told
Pete
.

That
done
,
I
told
Miss
Groggins
to
take
her
patient
back
to
bed
and
again
put
her
out
of
my
mind
.

``
I've
got
the
results
on
the
Bancroft
smear
test
''
,
he
said
.

Class
Three
,
they
said
.

But
that
was
ridiculous
,
of
course
.

``
All
right
.

``
We'd
like
you
to
have
a
dilatation
and
curettage
.

That's
quite
minor
,
nothing
to
worry
about
.

But
we
would
like
your
permission
to
do
--
that
is
,
to
go
further
if
it
proves
necessary
''
.

``
Suppose
you
let
me
explain
.

Even
if
we
do
,
you'll
be
out
of
here
in
a
week
,
probably
''
.

She
smiled
,
a
smile
without
humor
.

I
stared
at
her
,
almost
speechless
.

Her
little
speech
was
totally
out
of
character
with
the
sort
of
person
I
thought
she
was
.

This
was
someone
who'd
come
down
in
the
world
,
I
thought
.

I
knew
then
,
knew
with
a
heart-stopping
shock
.

``
Alice
,
for
goodness
sake
''
--

``
Where
have
you
been
all
these
years
''
?
?

She
shrugged
.

And
this
was
Gladdy's
mother
!
!

Let
her
out
,
let
her
out
--
that
would
be
the
solution
,
wouldn't
it
?
?

I
no
longer
knew
how
deep
I
was
,
somewhere
under
230
feet
,
getting
drunker
,
happier
and
more
contented
by
the
second
.

Perhaps
if
I
took
off
the
aqua-lung
I
could
swim
better
,
love
my
woman
better
.

I
knew
it
wouldn't
be
the
same
.

That
first
time
was
good
and
it
stuck
with
me
.

All
the
women
were
beautiful
,
and
the
men
were
equal
to
them
;
;

There
was
the
Arc
de
Triomphe
and
the
Tour
d'Eiffel
--
I
was
no
yokel
,
but
I
was
young
,
and
this
was
Paris
!
!

When
she
had
drained
the
last
of
the
bottle
and
paid
her
bill
,
she
came
directly
to
my
table
and
said
:

Is
your
evening
free
''
?
?

And
so
off
we
went
to
her
apartment
.

I
sat
waiting
for
Life
to
come
along
and
sweep
me
up
.

I
was
turning
over
the
idea
of
a
good
debauchery
when
I
dozed
off
.

I
walked
around
breathing
the
cold
wine
of
the
air
until
I
found
a
park
,
and
I
sat
down
on
a
snowy
bench
where
the
light
was
dim
and
came
from
the
sky
.

Without
it
she
would
have
been
drab
and
limp
.

I
knew
all
about
her
.

I
didn't
much
care
if
she
were
there
or
not
.

(
I
didn't
have
on
a
hat
.

This
took
me
so
funny
I
had
to
look
at
her
.

I
could
see
the
ancient
cynicism
reinforce
itself
in
her
eyes
,
and
I
wondered
how
many
men
she
had
picked
up
with
this
same
gambit
.

She
tilted
up
and
drank
,
and
then
I
drank
.

Somehow
she
was
attractive
.

Not
good
looking
,
but
self-confident
and
wise
so
that
it
made
her
attractive
.

I
think
we
were
very
tired
,
for
we
awoke
at
the
same
moment
,
deeply
rested
,
surprised
to
see
the
late
morning
sun
on
the
windows
,
which
were
wet
where
the
rime
had
melted
.

I
felt
wonderful
,
the
absolute
opposite
of
last
night's
melancholy
.

``
J'ai
faim
''
!
!

With
a
laugh
she
beat
me
to
the
bathroom
.

I
used
yours
''
.

``
Oh
''
?
?

But
I
smelled
the
coffee
,
and
thinking
,
What
the
hell
,
live
dangerously
,
I
decided
I
would
scald
my
worries
away
.

I
know
men
never
kiss
les
putains
''
.

She
smiled
all
the
way
to
her
wise
,
sad
eyes
,
and
drained
her
own
.

``
A
bullet
''
,
she
answered
.

It
was
a
nice
place
,
not
filled
with
smoke
.

The
sommelier
brought
the
wine
first
,
a
magnum
instead
of
the
bottle
I
had
ordered
.

Pictures
in
old
Latin
books
returned
to
her
:
the
Appian
Way
Today
,
the
Colosseum
,
the
Arch
of
Constantine
.

In
the
street
the
traffic
was
really
frightening
.

Shoals
of
tourists
went
by
her
in
national
groups
--
English
school
girls
in
blue
uniforms
,
German
boys
with
cameras
attached
,
smartly
dressed
Americans
looking
in
shop
windows
.

Glad
to
be
alone
,
Theresa
climbed
the
splendid
outdoor
staircase
that
opened
to
her
left
.

A
few
moments
later
her
hands
were
trembling
and
her
brow
had
contracted
with
anxiety
and
dismay
.

Cousin
Emma
had
simply
put
Miss
Theresa
Stubblefield
,
Rome
,
Italy
,
on
the
envelope
,
had
walked
up
to
the
post
office
in
Tuxapoka
,
Alabama
,
and
mailed
it
with
as
much
confidence
as
if
it
had
been
a
birthday
card
to
her
next-door
neighbor
.

Inside
were
all
the
things
they
thought
she
ought
to
know
concerning
the
last
illness
,
death
,
and
burial
of
Cousin
Alexander
Carraway
.

I'm
supposed
to
care
as
much
now
as
then
,
as
much
here
as
there
,
she
realized
,
with
a
sigh
.

This
letter
would
have
got
to
me
if
she
hadn't
even
put
Rome
,
Italy
,
on
it
.

A
life
of
gentility
and
principle
such
as
Cousin
Elec
had
lived
had
to
be
known
at
first
hand
.

Together
with
her
mother
,
both
of
them
tense
with
worry
lest
things
should
somehow
go
wrong
.

Theresa
had
seen
him
through
the
right
college
,
into
the
right
fraternity
,
and
though
pursued
by
various
girls
and
various
mammas
of
girls
,
safely
married
to
the
right
sort
,
however
much
in
the
early
years
of
that
match
his
wife
,
Anne
,
had
not
seemed
to
understand
poor
George
.

As
for
Cousin
Alexander
Carraway
,
the
only
thing
Theresa
could
remember
at
the
moment
about
him
(
except
his
paper
knife
)
was
that
he
had
had
exceptionally
long
hands
and
feet
and
one
night
about
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
whole
Stubblefield
family
had
been
aroused
to
go
next
door
at
Cousin
Emma's
call
--
first
Papa
,
then
Mother
,
then
Theresa
and
George
.

He
held
his
long
clenched
foot
in
both
hands
,
and
this
and
his
contorted
face
--
he
was
trying
heroically
not
to
cry
out
--
made
him
look
like
a
large
skinny
old
monkey
.

Theresa
shifted
to
a
new
page
.

``
Of
course
(
George's
letter
continued
)
,
there
are
practical
problems
to
be
considered
.

The
wallpaper
in
the
back
bedroom
is
literally
crumbling
off
.

''
(
Theresa
skipped
a
page
of
details
about
the
house
.

Yet
here
they
were
obviously
thought
to
be
handsome
,
and
felt
themselves
to
be
so
.

at
last
,
alarm
.

She
cast
about
as
though
looking
for
a
policeman
:
this
really
shouldn't
be
allowed
!
!

The
trouble
is
,
Theresa
thought
,
that
while
everything
that
happens
there
is
supposed
to
matter
supremely
,
nothing
here
is
supposed
even
to
exist
.

It
never
registered
with
them
that
I
had
time
to
read
all
of
Balzac
,
Dickens
,
and
Stendhal
while
Papa
was
dying
,
not
to
mention
everything
in
the
city
library
after
Mother's
operation
.

It
would
have
been
exactly
the
same
to
them
if
I
had
read
through
all
twenty-six
volumes
of
Elsie
Dinsmore
.

``
Mi
diapiace
,
Signora
,
ma
insomma
.

''

I
knew
it
as
surely
as
everybody
in
Westfield
--
that
Lucille
was
a
husband
stealer
.

Even
if
they
ever
did
say
anything
about
people
like
Lucille
Warren
,
I
know
they
wouldn't
have
dreamed
of
saying
it
in
front
of
me
.

He
had
an
easy
masculine
grace
about
him
,
the
kind
that
kids
don't
have
,
but
that
I
had
sometimes
admired
in
other
older
men
.

The
most
unbelievable
thing
about
the
chance
meeting
was
that
he
seemed
interested
in
me
,
too
.

But
he
wouldn't
ask
her
--
he
wasn't
the
kind
of
man
who
would
force
his
wife
to
submit
to
him
against
her
will
.

But
the
only
love
I
was
giving
him
was
the
pure
kind
.

``
It's
so
crazy
''
,
I
told
him
once
.

Somebody
with
no
vices
.

``
And
smokes
too
much
''
.

``
Don't
you
dare
''
.

``
You
wouldn't
''
.

And
now
he
was
seeing
her
.

Johnnie
and
I
had
been
innocent
in
our
love
,
and
that
was
the
way
I
wanted
to
keep
it
.

But
what
had
I
done
,
trying
to
keep
us
pure
?
?

My
very
first
time
.

``
Will
you
always
love
me
this
way
''
?
?

It
was
as
blissful
and
fulfilling
a
night
as
any
bride
ever
experienced
.

I
had
had
no
wedding
ceremony
,
no
witnesses
,
no
certificate
of
marriage
,
but
I
had
all
the
joy
that
goes
with
them
.

I
felt
no
conflict
between
what
I
was
doing
and
my
strict
religious
upbringing
.

Of
course
he
would
.

And
if
I
could
contribute
to
that
,
I'd
do
it
.

No
price
is
too
high
when
true
love
is
at
stake
.

``
Love
me
''
?
?

``
Uh-huh
.

Love
you
''
.

``
Always
and
always
,
Johnnie
''
?
?

Convention
time
in
Boston
.

A
chill
wind
in
the
air
and
the
narrow
streets
packed
with
snow
.

I'd
been
seeing
Johnnie
almost
a
year
now
,
but
I
still
didn't
want
to
leave
him
for
five
whole
days
.

I
hadn't
been
doing
as
much
work
as
I
used
to
in
Westfield
and
I
felt
funny
about
that
and
wanted
to
work
harder
than
ever
.

I
wanted
to
just
throw
myself
into
the
good
works
of
this
fine
group
.

One
of
them
was
a
very
friendly
,
lovely
fellow
named
Ronald
,
a
boy
about
my
age
with
slick
,
blond
hair
and
dancing
blue
eyes
.

``
Hey
,
there
,
beautiful
twin
of
mine
''
,
Ronald
said
.

My
folks
wouldn't
dream
of
having
alcohol
in
the
house
,
so
my
first
taste
of
it
had
been
--
of
course
--
with
Johnnie
.

C'mon
,
let's
find
out
where
they're
keeping
the
glasses
''
.

``
Aw
,
come
on
''
.

But
at
least
come
along
while
I
get
lubricated
''
.

Share
bath
,
maybe
--
but
share
refrigerator
?
?

This
is
a
sleeping
capsule
.

Charlie
had
accepted
the
diagnosis
without
comment
.

She
bellowed
triumphantly
.

``
Fine
,
day
after
tomorrow
''
,
she
added
.

``
I
hope
so
''
,
he
said
.

``
I've
got
this
cold
.

Better
get
in
out
of
the
wet
''
.

All
Charlie
could
look
forward
to
was
a
yellow
pill
at
noon
,
a
salami
sandwich
for
lunch
,
and
a
lonely
old
age
--
if
he
lived
that
long
.

He
dozed
,
only
to
dream
of
Vivian
,
and
woke
,
only
to
crash
into
the
night
table
,
bruising
his
other
shin
.

He
scrawled
``
Sorry
''
across
the
bottom
of
the
note
and
then
,
against
his
better
judgment
,
added
:
``
Don't
you
eat
''
?
?

``
Not
onions
''
,
came
the
answer
the
following
day
.

``
Ugh
''
.

They
would
be
black
or
white
or
horse-blanket
plaid
,
chic
and
splashy
,
like
Vivian
herself
.

``
Why
does
this
girl
keep
a
sweater
in
the
refrigerator
''
?
?

``
Oh
,
yes
.

You
want
to
watch
out
that
you
don't
get
burned
to
an
ash
,
first
sunny
day
.

He
could
hear
Mrs.
Kirby
now
,
warning
her
pale
guest
against
sunburn
.

When
Charlie
came
up
from
the
beach
for
his
four-o'clock
pill
,
the
whole
establishment
(
gaudy
enough
when
seen
through
mist
and
fog
)
looked
like
a
floodlit
modern
painting
--
great
blocks
of
dizzy
color
,
punctuated
at
regular
intervals
by
the
glaring
white
of
five
community
refrigerators
.

He
could
not
imagine
a
flower's
being
brave
enough
to
grow
beside
Peony
,
Larkspur
,
and
the
rest
.

She
didn't
sound
like
a
pale
girl
.

There
were
pink
bathing
suits
on
blondes
,
and
browny-haired
girls
in
red
or
black
or
green
bathing
suits
.

Up
on
a
dune
,
he
saw
a
girl
,
all
by
herself
,
sitting
on
a
camp
stool
before
an
easel
and
absorbed
in
her
painting
.

And
he
saw
them
all
as
he
walked
up
and
down
.

Finally
,
in
desperation
,
he
opened
the
refrigerator
,
filched
her
hand
lotion
,
and
left
a
note
.

``
Of
course
I
don't
mind
''
,
she
answered
.

This
was
a
very
warm
,
sympathetic
girl
,
he
decided
.

Now
Vivian
,
for
instance
,
was
not
too
long
on
sympathy
.

it
was
a
tough
world
,
and
you
had
to
be
tough
to
hold
your
own
.

Are
you
?
?

What's
puny
''
?
?

``
Puny
goes
with
pale
and
peaked
.

but
the
picture
of
Tom
Swift
is
pretty
sinister
.

For
a
few
innings
the
Anniston
team
couldn't
figure
him
out
.

Phil
Rossoff
cut
over
to
center
from
left
field
to
get
the
relay
.

Eddie
shouted
.

Mike
caught
the
ball
just
as
the
catcher
slid
into
the
bag
.

But
Mike
Deegan
was
boiling
mad
now
.

Phil
Rossoff
,
coming
in
from
left
field
,
stopped
at
the
water
fountain
for
a
drink
.

He
simply
turned
to
Mike
and
smiled
.

This
so
infuriated
Deegan
that
he
spun
around
and
said
:
``
I'll
get
that
little
bastard
.

When
Deegan
smiled
his
eyes
never
fit
in
with
his
lips
.

But
Mike
had
no
chance
of
being
tagged
.

Only
Mike
got
to
his
feet
.

Then
,
quickly
,
and
a
little
nervously
,
the
doctor
ordered
a
couple
of
ballplayers
to
carry
the
catcher
into
the
dressing
room
.

Mike
sat
quietly
watching
the
manager
come
nearer
.

``
For
God's
sake
''
,
Mike
said
,
waving
the
manager
away
.

He
called
in
the
pitcher
who
had
been
pitching
,
and
a
big
,
heavy
,
powerfully
built
right
hander
moved
out
to
the
mound
for
Anniston
.

He
shouted
to
the
pitcher
.

``
I'll
be
waiting
''
!
!

Phil
Rossoff
and
two
other
Riverside
players
did
not
go
out
on
the
field
when
the
fighting
started
.

Mike
went
over
to
Phil
and
stood
over
him
.

``
Well
!
!

``
I
didn't
ask
you
to
fight
for
the
ball
club
''
,
Phil
said
slowly
.

``
Nobody
else
did
,
either
''
.

And
Phil
banged
his
locker
door
shut
and
spun
around
.

He
sat
down
before
Eddie's
desk
.

Phil
stood
up
.

''

Eddie
stood
up
abruptly
,
then
sat
down
just
as
abruptly
.

A
sport
?
?

There
were
other
clubs
in
this
league
.

He
was
a
little
pale
and
shaky
.

Phil
turned
and
left
the
room
,
hearing
Eddie
say
:
``
Someday
you'll
see
I
was
right
''
.

Phil
shut
the
door
behind
him
.

Phil
said
:
``
I
got
my
release
''
.

``
What
for
''
?
?

Frankie
shook
his
head
.

``
Don't
take
it
like
this
''
,
Frankie
said
.

Phil
looked
up
.

``
Talk
to
Whitey
Jackson
''
.

He
just
didn't
know
what
he
was
talking
about
,
saying
a
thing
like
that
.

``
Ask
Whitey
for
a
job
''
.

Phil
nodded
.

He
needs
outfielders
bad
''
.

What
else
did
Eddie
have
to
say
''
?
?

When
he
was
twelve
he
took
to
reading
St.
Augustine
and
Aquinas
,
then
Lao-tse
,
Confucius
,
Mencius
,
Suzuki
,
Hindu
tomes
by
endless
Krishnaists
and
numerous
socio-archaeological
papers
.

For
his
birthday
,
because
Richard
had
seen
them
in
a
store
and
asked
for
them
,
his
mother
bought
him
the
Zend-Avesta
and
a
little
image
of
the
Indian
god
,
Acala
.

Although
he
still
didn't
speak
to
anyone
,
he
grew
fond
of
saying
,
``
The
future
lies
in
Asia
''
,
when
the
opportunity
arose
,
and
when
he
graduated
from
high
school
his
parents
sent
him
to
New
York
to
give
him
a
foundation
,
they
said
,
for
his
life
in
Asian
studies
.

She
seemed
to
work
to
grow
close
to
her
son
in
the
few
days
he
spent
at
home
,
talking
to
him
about
some
of
the
more
pleasant
moments
of
his
childhood
and
then
trying
to
talk
to
him
about
those
things
in
which
he
alone
was
interested
.

``
Do
you
still
have
The
Book
of
the
Dead
''
?
?

He
had
dusted
each
of
the
books
carefully
and
carried
them
all
to
the
basement
and
,
trembling
at
having
to
open
the
big
furnace
,
given
them
up
to
the
flames
.

``
Well
,
it's
at
Fudomae
and
there
was
a
tan
young
man
,
quite
naked
,
taking
a
shower
in
the
pool
.

I
was
thoroughly
startled
''
.

Sushi
was
Out
because
it
was
pretentious
.

Sashimi
was
In
,
Samuel
Burns
had
suggested
,
because
it
was
too
far
Out
to
stay
Out
,
even
if
it
was
a
little
pretentious
.

Richard
had
kept
his
eyes
down
throughout
the
game
,
the
very
sound
of
the
chatter
nearly
painful
to
his
ears
.

``
Did
you
watch
him
''
?
?

``
Well
I
was
able
to
do
it
''
,
Charlotte
said
with
no
sign
of
irritation
.

``
I've
heard
about
it
''
,
Samuel
Burns
said
.

``
Twenty-two
or
twenty-three
''
.

He
found
himself
trying
to
remember
something
,
but
he
couldn't
decide
even
the
nature
of
what
it
was
he
worked
to
recall
.

That
night
,
after
leaving
Charlotte's
apartment
,
Richard
walked
about
for
a
time
before
returning
to
his
room
.

The
strange
creature
,
housed
in
wire
,
made
him
shudder
.

The
sensation
he
so
overwhelmingly
realized
was
one
which
told
him
he
had
been
there
before
but
he
knew
he
had
not
,
and
could
not
recall
any
place
he
had
visited
to
be
likened
to
the
limpid
green
water
or
the
little
fountain-falls
or
the
green
demon
imprisoned
beyond
his
reach
.

The
black
Fudo
seemed
to
stare
rigidly
back
at
him
and
Richard's
eyes
were
caught
by
the
Fudo's
in
fascination
,
and
then
Richard
was
shocked
as
,
all
at
once
,
flames
shot
out
from
the
sharp
features
of
Fudo's
face
and
there
was
a
terrible
metallic
scraping
sound
,
as
if
the
large
statue
were
about
to
burst
from
some
pressure
within
it
.

It
lay
half
in
the
furrow
and
half
out
,
and
the
front
wheels
had
rolled
nearly
up
to
it
when
I
put
in
the
clutch
.

The
tractor
was
heavily
loaded
with
the
weight
of
the
plow
turning
the
earth
,
and
the
tractor
stopped
instantly
.

The
snake
slid
slowly
and
with
great
care
from
the
new
ridge
the
plow
had
made
,
into
the
furrow
and
did
not
go
any
further
.

Go
out
of
the
furrow
,
snake
,
I
said
,
but
it
did
not
move
at
all
.

The
colors
were
astonishing
,
clear
and
bright
,
and
it
was
as
if
the
body
held
a
fire
of
its
own
,
and
the
colors
came
through
that
transparent
flesh
and
skin
,
vivid
and
alive
and
warm
.

I
had
killed
snakes
before
,
when
I
was
younger
,
but
there
had
been
no
animal
like
this
one
,
and
I
knew
it
was
unthinkable
that
an
animal
such
as
that
should
die
.

The
sharp
,
burning
colors
of
his
body
stood
brilliant
and
plain
against
the
black
soil
,
like
a
target
.

The
color
and
beauty
of
it
were
strange
and
wonderful
and
somehow
alien
,
too
,
in
that
dry
and
dusty
and
uncolored
field
.

Even
at
that
distance
,
with
no
sound
but
the
sound
of
the
tractor
,
I
could
tell
the
fierce
mark
of
brutality
on
the
boy
.

Stop
it
,
I
shouted
,
but
the
lumbering
and
mighty
tractor
roared
on
,
above
anything
I
could
say
.

It
was
no
use
.

The
boy
waited
at
the
corner
,
with
the
jar
of
water
held
up
to
me
in
his
hands
,
and
the
water
had
grown
bubbly
in
the
heat
of
the
morning
.

I
stopped
the
tractor
and
climbed
down
and
the
boy
came
eagerly
up
to
me
.

I
looked
closely
at
his
eyes
,
and
he
was
already
innocent
;
;

the
killing
was
already
forgotten
in
that
clear
mind
of
his
.

I
asked
.

``
Snakes
are
ugly
''
,
he
said
again
.

``
You
know
there
are
no
poisonous
snakes
in
this
area
.

``
You
killed
it
because
you
wanted
to
kill
it
,
for
no
other
reason
''
.

``
Nobody
likes
snakes
''
.

``
I'm
going
to
tell
everybody
how
big
a
snake
I
killed
''
.

I
could
have
slapped
the
boy
.

He
looked
up
at
me
,
puzzled
,
and
he
swayed
his
head
from
side
to
side
.

Yes
,
the
boy's
credentials
were
in
order
--
scholastic
transcript
,
character
references
,
picture
,
health
record
,
successful
college
boards
.

Cady
Partlow
lit
his
pipe
with
no
comfort
.

This
was
the
letter
which
would
or
would
not
enroll
his
son
,
David
,
in
Hanford
.

His
son
who
did
not
know
whether
he
wanted
to
be
doctor
,
lawyer
,
merchant
or
chief
.

Pete's
son
was
rejected
.

But
then
,
he
hadn't
studied
very
hard
.

Weight
,
160
.

His
chief
motivation
for
enrolling
at
Hanford
is
the
desire
to
''
--

He
told
Hanford
his
son
wanted
to
go
into
the
field
of
electronics
.

He
told
Hanford
his
son
had
participated
in
numerous
high-school
activities
.

After
all
,
his
wife
had
written
most
of
his
letters
for
him
in
those
first
lean
days
of
Partlow
Products
.

Anne
had
it
.

``
That's
a
fact
,
Mr.
Partlow
.

Always
messing
around
with
science
stuff
.

He
hadn't
told
anyone
,
but
he
,
too
,
had
applied
to
five
colleges
for
David
.

So
sorry
.

He
liked
her
blond
hair
and
the
sprinkle
of
freckles
across
her
nose
.

She
always
could
sense
the
shag
end
of
a
woolly
day
.

``
No
,
I
begged
off
.

I
know
it
is
midweek
,
but
it's
only
eight
days
before
commencement
.

Let's
forget
the
rules
''
.

Cady
,
deep
in
thought
,
neither
heard
nor
answered
.

David
grinned
.

``
I'm
sorry
,
Dave
.

The
car
?
?

Of
course
you
can
have
it
''
.

``
Don't
worry
about
it
,
Dave
.

Dave
shrugged
on
his
sports
coat
and
picked
up
the
car
keys
.

Anne
said
it
wasn't
surprising
because
Charles
was
antisocial
,
a
lone
wolf
,
and
completely
one-sided
.

Get
my
old
man
to
bed
early
.

Anne
waited
until
the
door
had
slammed
and
picked
up
the
coffeepot
.

``
Let's
go
into
the
library
.

``
Wrong
word
,
darling
.

He
just
took
over
the
week
Bill
Daley
was
in
the
state
basketball
play-off
''
.

``
The
fact
remains
he
was
treasurer
''
.

``
A
team
is
a
team
''
,
insisted
Cady
.

``
What
do
you
suggest
''
?
?

``
Just
say
he
likes
swimming
,
tennis
,
chess
and
music
''
.

``
You
mean
that
rock-and-roll
combo
?
?

Even
in
that
he
never
solos
like
Jack
on
guitar
or
Rich
on
sax
.

He's
--
he's
just
there
,
that's
all
''
.

``
Did
you
know
he
is
advertising
his
ham-radio
equipment
for
sale
this
weekend
?
?

Anne
picked
up
the
towel
she
was
hemming
for
the
hospital
guild
.

``
Dave
has
qualities
of
leadership
.

He
just
hasn't
developed
them
yet
.

Not
the
kind
of
leadership
you
mean
,
working
with
lots
of
people
.

All
your
wishful
thinking
won't
change
that
.

No
doubt
Dolores
resented
following
in
their
footsteps
.

But
,
to
put
it
bluntly
,
nothing
snapped
.

They
married
.

He
saw
later
that
they
had
made
their
marriage
too
quickly
.

Martin
gave
her
a
teasing
pat
.

He
smiled
to
himself
,
and
decided
not
to
mention
them
till
Dolores
did
.

The
rest
of
the
bedroom
had
been
groomed
to
a
superhuman
neatness
,
but
in
the
middle
of
the
carpet
lay
the
disheveled
shorts
.

Ten
minutes
early
.

Dolores
stood
motionless
in
the
doorway
.

Martin
strained
his
ears
.

At
first
he
could
not
be
sure
.

All
evening
Anthea
favored
him
with
odd
,
coy
looks
.

Clearly
she
had
been
instructed
``
not
to
say
a
word
''
.

Martin
realized
,
later
on
,
that
he
should
have
``
had
it
out
''
with
Dolores
that
night
.

On
the
contrary
,
it
would
only
weaken
his
position
if
he
fumed
,
while
she
stayed
calm
and
adamant
.

But
his
resolution
hardly
seemed
to
help
.

Some
tried
to
ignore
the
blot
on
the
bedroom's
countenance
.

``
It's
a
little
contest
Martin
and
I
have
''
,
she
would
begin
gaily
,
carrying
the
anecdote
through
a
frothy
and
deceptive
course
.

They
entered
the
bedroom
,
and
Dolores
said
nothing
.

With
her
eyes
Dolores
dared
him
for
the
truth
,
ready
to
begin
:
It's
a
little
contest
--

Never
again
did
he
enter
into
the
ritual
of
showing
the
apartment
.

But
Martin
seldom
felt
the
impulse
to
talk
about
anything
.

Bizarre
:
He
could
hear
the
word
.

Six
weeks
of
marriage
and
I'm
using
the
past
tense
,
he
told
himself
furiously
.

Everyone
would
know
why
;
;

To
have
her
underclothes
linked
with
his
on
the
floor
would
draw
her
visibly
into
a
struggle
both
bitter
and
absurd
.

Slowly
and
deliberately
she
reached
down
and
touched
the
lace
with
her
fingers
,
then
hesitated
for
about
a
second
.

Ah
,
he
thought
,
she's
going
through
the
chain
of
reasoning
which
says
she
might
really
just
as
well
pick
up
my
shorts
too
.

Extending
her
fingers
another
inch
,
she
caught
up
the
shorts
,
and
swiftly
left
the
room
.

He
left
for
work
in
high
spirits
.

He
found
that
he
no
longer
hated
Dolores
(
he
knew
how
much
he
had
hated
her
)
,
and
he
was
surprised
at
a
resurgence
of
an
affectionate
feeling
.

But
not
any
more
.

A
rush
of
memory
swept
him
back
,
and
he
forgot
Cap
.

Freddy
needed
a
job
,
having
been
detached
from
a
rather
dangerous
career
in
real
estate
and
skyscraper
financing
by
Gerry
,
and
it
was
up
to
Arthur
Willis
to
provide
him
with
one
.

Shortly
after
,
Freddy
had
his
usual
proliferation
of
bold
ideas
.

The
conversion
will
cost
a
fortune
.

The
future
of
manned
aircraft
is
in
doubt
,
which
affects
government
procurement
,
and
jet
transports
have
revolutionized
the
airline
trade
--
one
jet
can
take
the
place
of
three
compound-engine
planes
.

Here
are
a
few
facts
and
figures
I've
assembled
.

If
we
don't
take
care
,
the
sisters
will
be
entering
the
fray
on
opposite
sides
,
brandishing
their
cudgels
''
.

Adam
,
beset
by
changing
defense
conditions
and
the
open
secret
that
he
was
part
of
the
new
corporation
,
couldn't
deliver
from
his
end
.

``
You
were
right
''
,
he
said
--
``
you
and
your
engineer
--
and
I'm
in
something
of
a
bind
.

If
A-Z
could
buy
Ticonderoga
cheaply
and
use
their
presses
and
dies
and
other
equipment
,
if
William
could
hit
precisely
the
right
promotion
note
,
if
the
money
hurdle
was
not
insurmountable
.

He
paused
.

``
Oh
,
my
God
''
,
Ham
Richert
said
,
``
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
.

Look
what
those
little
European
jobs
are
doing
.

We'll
woo
the
consumer
with
a
product
,
not
bludgeon
him
with
chromed
excess
length
and
weight
.

He
swayed
them
somewhat
,
but
the
debate
raged
on
.

You're
up
against
it
anyhow
.

A
silence
fell
.

I'm
not
giving
you
a
chance
,
Bill
,
but
availing
myself
of
your
generous
offer
of
assistance
.

Sweat
started
out
on
William's
forehead
,
whether
from
relief
or
disquietude
he
could
not
tell
.

``
I
suppose
I
can
never
expect
to
call
you
'
General
'
after
that
Washington
episode
''
.

At
the
moment
,
Barco's
back
was
to
the
road
so
he
didn't
see
the
detectives
close
in
on
his
convertible
which
,
in
their
quest
for
the
stolen
lap
rug
,
they
proceeded
to
search
.

The
robe
,
however
,
was
missing
,
for
by
that
time
Barco
had
disposed
of
it
at
a
pawnshop
in
Glendale
.

During
the
return
trip
,
Barco
kept
muttering
to
himself
in
meaningless
phrases
,
such
as
:
``
They're
under
sand
dunes
They're
better
off
,
I
tell
you
I
saved
their
souls
''
.

Welch
wanted
to
know
why
.

So
he
paid
a
call
on
Barco
in
his
cell
and
began
their
chat
by
stating
bluntly
:

``
Barco
,
we've
got
the
goods
on
you
!
!

Welch
summoned
jail
officials
to
Barco's
cell
.

It
required
strength
,
bravado
,
daring
to
commit
murder
.

''

Nothing
was
found
.

With
quibs
and
gibes
,
the
policemen
again
started
digging
.

Welch
was
on
edge
.

The
captain
was
remarking
that
it
was
a
nice
day
for
a
picnic
when
finally
one
of
the
shovels
struck
an
object
.

Said
the
digger
.

Joking
stopped
and
everyone
gathered
around
.

Now
did
Welch
truly
become
the
man
of
the
hour
,
and
everything
that
followed
in
the
procedure
of
Justice
was
a
new
triumph
for
him
.

Every
new
scandal
which
would
provide
more
``
copy
''
for
Marshall's
pen
would
thus
mean
more
publicity
for
Welch
.

I
studied
Welch
closely
as
the
trial
progressed
for
any
hint
which
might
give
me
a
lead
as
to
how
he
might
be
thwarted
.

Naturally
,
Viola
had
no
wish
to
remain
,
but
she
felt
she
couldn't
leave
so
soon
after
her
arrival
,
in
all
politeness
to
her
host
.

Then
,
noting
neither
the
absence
of
his
footwear
nor
the
presence
of
the
rosebuds
,
he
made
his
way
to
the
Byzantine
room
and
,
with
his
usual
dignity
,
mounted
the
rostrum
.

The
incident
,
aside
from
reflecting
on
Welch's
political
career
,
had
all
but
wrecked
his
home
life
.

But
Mother
insisted
,
for
it
is
seldom
indeed
that
anyone
remotely
connected
with
the
cinema
is
ever
received
in
their
exclusive
midsts
.

In
fact
,
it
was
not
until
the
King
of
Spain
had
visited
at
Pickfair
that
Mary
and
Doug
were
beckoned
to
cross
the
sacred
barriers
which
separate
Los
Angeles
and
Pasadena
from
the
hoi-polloi
.

Mother
even
went
so
far
as
to
trump
up
for
me
matrimonial
opportunities
with
Pasadena
debs
who
had
been
educated
abroad
,
and
with
those
of
the
more
lenient
Los
Angeles
area
where
a
debutante
was
a
girl
who
had
been
to
high
school
.

Viola
greeted
me
,
in
checked
apron
,
ladle
in
hand
,
and
explained
it
was
the
cook's
night
out
and
that
she
herself
was
preparing
dinner
.

The
most
that
was
accomplished
was
adding
Mrs.
Beige's
tray
to
the
dish
pile
,
and
by
means
of
repeated
threats
,
on
an
ascending
scale
,
seeing
that
the
girls
dressed
themselves
,
after
a
fashion
.

No
matter
if
your
children
are
at
the
movies
,
in
school
,
visiting
their
grandmother
,
or
on
a
field
trip
in
some
distant
city
,
they
will
be
upon
you
magically
within
seconds
after
you
pick
up
the
phone
.

I'm
not
saying
it
right
.

What
I
meant
to
say
was
that
I
started
to
start
in
on
the
dishes
by
gathering
them
all
together
in
the
kitchen
sink
.

They
had
bought
their
house
in
Catatonia
after
investigating
all
the
regions
of
suburbia
surrounding
New
York
;
;

Fran
flaunted
her
independence
by
rebelling
against
the
Catatonia
uniform
of
Bermuda
shorts
and
knee-length
socks
by
wearing
Bermuda
shorts
and
knee-length
socks
in
colors
;
;

It
seemed
,
indeed
,
that
their
house
was
not
so
much
a
home
,
but
rather
a
perfect
stage
set
,
and
that
they
were
actors
who
had
been
handed
fat
roles
in
a
successful
play
,
and
had
talent
enough
to
fill
the
roles
competently
,
with
nice
understatement
.

Practically
the
only
enthusiasm
they
showed
was
when
they
were
discussing
``
names
''
;
;

even
brand
names
.

Besides
Francesca
,
there
was
Blanche
.

I
had
once
been
a
witness
when
Blanche
had
smiled
and
said
with
only
minimum
ruefulness
,
``
Oh
,
my
souffle
has
collapsed
''
.

Anyone
knows
how
a
real
,
red-blooded
woman
would
react
to
such
a
catastrophe
!
!

not
Blanche
.

Francesca
and
Grazie
were
habitual
committee
chairmen
and
they
usually
managed
to
be
elected
co-chairmen
,
equal
bosses
,
of
whatever
PTA
or
civic
project
was
being
launched
.

Her
uniform
was
of
rich
,
raw
silk
,
in
a
shade
which
matched
her
hair
,
skin
,
housepaint
,
and
cats
,
and
since
she
was
so
thin
as
to
be
almost
shapeless
,
she
rather
resembled
a
frozen
fish
stick
.

The
husbands
of
these
women
and
others
I
had
met
in
Catatonia
were
distinguished
only
in
that
they
were
,
to
me
at
least
,
indistinguishable
.

They
were
,
I
felt
,
people
invariably
trying
to
prove
not
who
,
but
what
they
were
,
and
trying
to
determine
what
,
not
who
,
others
were
.

``
They're
not
dessert
!
!

The
cake
was
received
in
a
stunned
silence
that
was
evidence
in
itself
of
the
dearth
of
taste
thrills
Mama
had
been
providing
.

Needless
to
say
,
I
was
furious
at
this
unparalleled
intrusion
upon
free
enterprise
.

``
It
is
as
though
''
,
I
said
on
the
historic
three-hour
,
coast-to-coast
radio
broadcast
which
I
bought
(
following
Father
Coughlin
and
pre-empting
the
Eddie
Cantor
,
Manhattan
Merry-go-round
and
Major
Bowes
shows
)
``
That
Man
in
the
White
House
,
like
some
despot
of
yore
,
insisted
on
reading
my
diary
,
raiding
my
larder
and
ransacking
my
lingerie
!
!

''
My
impassioned
plea
for
civil
rights
created
a
landslide
of
correspondence
and
one
sponsor
even
asked
me
to
consider
replacing
the
Eddie
Cantor
comedy
hour
on
a
permanent
basis
.

The
savage
barbarian
hordes
of
red
Russian
Communism
descended
on
the
Athens
that
was
mighty
Metronome
,
sacking
and
despoiling
with
their
Bolshevistic
battle
cry
of
``
Soak
the
rich
'
!
!

I
was
also
publicly
reprimanded
,
dragged
through
the
mud
by
the
radical
press
and
made
a
figure
of
fun
by
such
leftist
publications
as
The
New
Republic
,
The
New
Yorker
,
Time
and
The
Christian
Science
Monitor
.

It
was
then
that
I
availed
myself
of
the
rights
of
a
citizen
and
declared
the
income
tax
unconstitutional
.

Presidential
coercion
had
succeeded
not
only
in
poisoning
the
courtiers
,
``
toadies
''
and
sycophants
of
the
``
bench
''
against
me
,
but
it
had
been
so
far-reaching
as
to
discourage
any
lawyer
in
the
nation
from
representing
me
!
!

I
was
ready
,
like
Portia
,
to
present
my
own
brief
.

But
the
Supreme
Court
wouldn't
even
hear
my
case
!
!

Again
,
my
name
was
on
all
the
front
pages
.

I
point
now
with
pride
to
the
fact
that
,
long
ere
the
Committee
on
Un-American
Activities
,
the
Minute
Women
,
the
Economic
Council
and
other
such
notable
``
watchdog
''
organizations
were
so
much
as
heard
of
,
I
was
Hollywood's
leading
bulwark
against
communism
,
fighting
single-handedly
``
creeping
socialism
''
against
such
insuperable
odds
as
the
Fascio-Communist
troops
of
the
NRA
,
PWA
,
WPA
,
CCC
and
an
army
of
more
than
twenty-two
million
mercenaries
whom
F.D.R.
employed
secretly
,
through
the
transparent
ruse
of
regular
``
relief
''
checks
.

Such
sweeping
distractions
are
hardly
conducive
to
``
Oscar
''
winning
performances
.

I
tried
my
hardest
,
with
little
help
,
may
I
say
,
from
my
husband
and
leading
man
,
but
somehow
the
outside
pressures
were
too
severe
.

Never
once
did
he
buy
me
a
single
gift
and
for
our
third
anniversary
he
gave
me
a
dislocated
jaw
.

(
But
that
is
another
story
.

)
As
for
his
private
monies
,
they
were
rapidly
dissipated
in
drinking
,
gaming
and
carousing
.

And
at
three
different
times
during
our
turbulent
marriage
strange
girls
,
with
the
commonest
of
accents
,
telephoned
to
announce
to
me
that
Letch
had
sired
their
unborn
children
!
!

``
Ah
,
you're
too
old
''
,
was
invariably
his
ungallant
and
untrue
retort
whenever
I
suggested
``
starting
a
family
''
.

I
now
felt
it
wiser
to
keep
Baby-dear
in
school
and
--
during
the
summers
--
at
a
camp
run
by
the
Society
of
Friends
all
year
around
.

With
faint
heart
and
a
brave
smile
,
I
endured
his
long
absences
from
Chateau
Belletch
,
his
coldness
,
his
indifference
,
his
slights
and
his
abuse
.

And
did
he
appreciate
my
efforts
on
his
behalf
?
?

He
did
not
!
!

He
made
many
tasteless
,
irreverent
and
unfunny
remarks
,
not
only
about
me
in
the
title
role
,
but
about
religion
in
general
.

At
the
same
time
,
however
,
I
availed
myself
of
the
services
of
that
great
English
actor
and
master
of
make-up
,
Sir
Gauntley
Pratt
,
to
do
a
``
quickie
''
called
The
Mystery
of
the
Mad
Marquess
,
in
which
I
played
a
young
American
girl
who
inherits
a
haunted
castle
on
the
English
moors
which
is
filled
with
secret
passages
and
sliding
panels
and
,
unbeknownst
to
anyone
,
is
still
occupied
by
an
eccentric
maniac
.

My
heart
was
not
in
it
,
but
,
oddly
enough
,
it
remains
the
most
financially
successful
picture
of
my
career
.

He
had
almost
forgotten
them
,
although
they
had
played
such
an
important
part
in
his
early
dreams
.

Did
older
people
work
more
slowly
?
?

Did
it
take
a
man
of
sixty-five
longer
to
write
a
letter
,
shave
,
clean
out
a
barn
,
read
a
newspaper
,
than
a
man
of
thirty
?
?

It
might
be
that
certain
people
were
born
with
a
compulsion
to
complicate
their
lives
,
while
others
could
live
blissfully
motionless
almost
indefinitely
,
like
lizards
in
the
sun
,
too
indolent
to
blink
their
eyes
.

They
could
be
done
or
left
undone
and
nobody
really
gave
a
damn
.

He
turned
over
impatiently
and
pulled
the
sheet
over
his
head
against
the
treacherous
encroachment
of
the
dawn
.

He
didn't
even
ask
the
cost
of
this
collection
.

After
the
pegboard
there
would
be
the
paneling
.

It
all
seemed
rather
hopeless
.

Mr.
Mills
had
done
some
figuring
on
a
scrap
of
paper
and
given
him
the
various
kinds
of
boards
and
two-by-fours
which
,
properly
handled
,
would
,
he
had
assured
him
,
turn
into
a
workbench
.

They
lay
on
the
cellar
floor
in
a
disorderly
pile
.

Then
at
least
he
would
have
a
place
to
hang
his
tools
and
something
to
work
on
.

He
went
upstairs
to
phone
Crumb
.

He
didn't
seem
to
think
that
attaching
a
pegboard
to
a
stone
wall
was
much
of
a
problem
and
he
tossed
off
the
building
of
the
worktable
equally
lightly
.

Carpenters
all
wanted
steady
work
and
at
the
moment
every
mother's
son
for
twenty
miles
around
that
could
hammer
nails
for
twenty-five
dollars
a
day
was
working
on
the
school
job
.

Mr.
Blatz
had
been
at
least
sober
enough
to
remember
to
telephone
and
he
turned
out
to
be
the
greatest
boon
that
had
come
into
Mr.
Crombie's
life
since
he
moved
to
Highfield
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
didn't
work
very
fast
or
very
long
at
a
time
,
and
he
didn't
like
to
work
at
all
unless
Mr.
Crombie
hung
around
and
talked
to
him
.

At
the
same
time
he
watched
carefully
to
see
how
one
attached
pegboards
to
stone
walls
,
but
Mr.
Blatz
was
usually
standing
in
his
line
of
vision
and
it
all
seemed
so
simple
that
he
didn't
like
to
disclose
his
ignorance
.

He
followed
Mr.
Blatz
up
the
cellar
stairs
.

As
usual
,
Mrs.
Crombie
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
confusion
of
cooking
utensils
.

``
But
those
are
the
things
I
built
the
workshop
for
''
,
protested
Mr.
Crombie
.

And
a
witty
American
journalist
remarked
over
a
century
ago
what
is
even
more
true
today
,
``
Many
a
writer
seems
to
think
he
is
never
profound
except
when
he
can't
understand
his
own
meaning
''
.

There
are
many
types
of
ambiguity
and
many
of
them
have
been
described
by
rhetoricians
under
such
names
as
amphibology
,
parisology
,
and
other
ologies
.

In
common
parlance
they
would
be
described
as
misses
--
misinterpreters
,
misunderstanders
,
misdirectors
and
kindred
misdeeds
.

Similarly
,
when
a
reporter
once
questioned
Lincoln
in
cryptic
fashion
,
Lincoln
refused
to
make
any
further
statement
.

``
Senator
''
,
said
an
interviewer
,
``
your
constituents
can't
understand
from
your
speech
last
night
just
how
you
stand
on
the
question
''
.

The
misplaced
modifier
is
another
species
more
honored
in
the
observance
of
obscurity
than
in
the
breach
.

``
I
see
the
girl
but
I
don't
see
the
car
with
slacks
on
''
.

Son
and
Daughter
of
Local
Couple
Married
''
.

The
newspaper
too
is
the
favorite
habitat
of
the
anatomical
.

This
slip
is
so-called
because
its
semi-ambiguous
English
always
seems
to
refer
to
a
person's
anatomy
but
never
quite
means
what
it
seems
to
say
.

There
are
many
grammatical
misconstructions
other
than
dangling
modifiers
and
anatomicals
which
permit
two
different
interpretations
.

At
the
home
of
a
gourmet
the
new
maid
was
instructed
in
the
fine
points
of
serving
.

It
is
but
so-so
''
.

This
is
not
unlike
the
order
received
by
the
sergeant
of
an
army
motor
pool
:
``
Four
trucks
to
Fort
Mason
gym
,
7:30
tonight
,
for
hauling
girls
to
dance
.

He
asked
.

She
inquired
.

``
Who's
in
it
''
?
?

She
continued
.

There
was
a
short
pause
for
reflection
.

``
That's
one
thing
I've
never
done
''
,
she
said
promptly
.

Replies
to
requests
for
character
reference
are
notorious
for
their
evasive
double-entendre
.

Another
less
ambiguous
case
read
as
follows
:
``
The
bearer
of
this
letter
has
served
me
for
two
years
to
his
complete
satisfaction
.

It-wit
is
a
misnomer
because
it
covers
slips
as
well
as
wit
.

``
I
have
come
to
talk
with
you
about
the
future
of
humor
and
comedy
''
,
I
told
him
,
at
which
he
started
slightly
,
and
then
made
us
each
a
stiff
drink
,
with
a
trembling
hand
.

``
Can
I
bear
it
''
?
?

``
I'll
try
''
,
I
said
,
and
sat
for
a
moment
thinking
.

``
If
we
cannot
tell
evil
,
horror
,
and
insanity
from
nonsense
,
what
is
the
future
of
humor
and
comedy
''
?
?

``
I
know
what
you
mean
''
,
Moreland
sighed
.

There
was
a
long
silence
.

I
myself
hear
it
said
constantly
--
in
drawing-rooms
.

``
I
am
worried
about
the
current
meanings
of
the
word
funny
.

and
frightening
,
as
when
a
wife
tells
the
police
that
it
is
funny
,
but
her
husband
hasn't
been
home
for
two
days
and
nights
''
.

Moreland
sat
brooding
for
a
full
minute
,
during
which
I
made
each
of
us
a
new
drink
.

Borrowing
a
line
from
Don
Marquis'
Mehitabel
.

It
now
means
,
in
my
country
,
homosexual
''
,
I
said
.

``
Oh
,
I
forgot
to
say
that
if
one
is
taken
to
the
funny
house
in
the
funny
wagon
,
he
is
removed
to
a
mental
institution
in
an
ambulance
.

``
Do
you
remember
the
woman
in
the
French
Alps
who
was
all
alone
with
her
sheep
one
day
when
the
sun
darkened
ominously
?
?

``
If
you
saw
the
drama
called
Rhinoceros
''
,
I
said
,
``
think
of
the
effect
it
would
have
on
an
audience
of
rhinos
when
the
actor
on
stage
suddenly
begins
turning
into
a
rhinoceros
.

Moreland
demanded
.

``
Non-God
,
no
''
,
I
said
.

In
his
famous
meeting
with
Nixon
a
couple
of
years
ago
he
seemed
to
believe
that
he
was
as
funny
as
Ed
Wynn
.

But
,
like
Caesar
,
he
has
only
one
joke
,
so
far
as
I
can
find
out
.

It
consists
in
saying
,
'
That
would
be
sending
the
goat
to
look
after
the
cabbage
.

``
Such
as
''
?
?

Moreland
went
over
to
stare
at
his
peacocks
again
,
and
then
came
back
and
sat
down
,
restively
.

``
The
human
ego
being
what
it
is
''
,
I
put
in
,
``
science
fiction
has
always
assumed
that
the
creatures
on
the
planets
of
a
thousand
larger
solar
systems
than
ours
must
look
like
gigantic
tube-nosed
fruit
bats
.

``
There
was
also
Gott
strafe
Angleterre
''
,
Moreland
reminded
me
,
``
and
Carthago
delenda

,
or
if
you
will
,
Deus

Carthage
.

I
wrote
a
few
years
ago
that
one
of
the
cardinal
rules
of
writing
is
that
the
reader
should
be
able
to
get
some
idea
of
what
the
story
is
about
.

He
looked
so
comfortable
being
straight
.

Arlene
was
so
ashamed
that
she
hung
her
head
when
she
said
,
``
Yes
,
sir
''
.

That
had
happened
on
the
day
when
two
other
unusual
things
had
occurred
.

In
matters
of
exact
information
,
that
kept
her
one
step
behind
developments
;
;

She
would
sometimes
even
get
a
little
hard
on
you
,
she
took
you
so
seriously
.

She
made
General
Burnside's
horse's
belly
do
so
funny
when
it
was
upside
down
.

Then
,
she
was
back
on
her
feet
,
winking
and
smiling
that
enormous
smile
(
she
had
lots
of
wonderful
big
teeth
that
you
never
would
have
suspected
she
had
when
she
was
not
smiling
)
.

But
they
kept
on
clapping
for
a
long
,
long
time
.

It
all
has
something
to
do
with
General
Burnside
and
his
horse
''
.

His
legs
shook
,
and
the
shaking
went
right
on
up
his
body
through
his
hips
to
his
shoulders
.

They
had
to
be
told
that
one
.

But
not
General
Burnside
.

He
never
could
keep
still
,
even
when
he
didn't
move
his
feet
.

That
helped
a
great
deal
.

``
It's
perfectly
understandable
,
Arlene
''
,
my
mother
said
in
a
friendly
way
.

She
would
try
to
see
over
the
bulge
of
her
cheeks
and
somewhat
under
her
teeth
to
the
place
where
she
was
biting
.

Actually
,
it
was
inaudible
to
anyone
not
expecting
it
.

But
I
would
not
pamper
myself
in
that
silly
way
.

A
friend
of
my
father's
came
to
dinner
.

As
a
matter
of
fact
,
this
happened
every
four
or
five
months
.

Sometimes
,
as
at
this
juncture
,
he
did
not
.

He
liked
children
,
in
a
loathsome
kind
of
way
;
;

the
two
youngest
in
our
family
always
had
to
be
brought
in
and
put
through
tricks
for
his
entertainment
.

This
evening
,
they
were
pushed
in
from
the
breakfast
room
,
with
odds
and
ends
of
dessert
distributed
over
them
.

They
were
pushed
gently
into
the
room
by
Arlene
--
whose
only
part
appearing
were
hands
that
crept
quickly
back
around
to
the
kitchen
side
of
the
door
.

``
We
go
to
the
park
with
this
nice
lady
''
,
one
of
them
said
.

He
asked
,
between
wheezes
of
laughter
.

``
You
don't
step
on
the
flowers
,
do
you
?
?

Mr.
Gorboduc
took
a
swig
of
his
sherry
.

He
was
so
long
thinking
that
my
mother
had
time
to
inspect
her
sherry
for
dregs
.

He
asked
.

Only
,
unfortunately
,
he
could
not
remove
from
his
voice
a
nagging
insinuation
of
the
direct
command
.

She
could
see
that
Mr.
Gorboduc
was
intrigued
;
;

My
uncle
looked
at
Mr.
Gorboduc
.

Marcellus
,
the
hero
,
is
beset
from
all
sides
by
the
problems
of
approaching
manhood
.

Suddenly
,
a
messenger
arrives
and
,
just
before
collapsing
dead
at
his
feet
,
informs
him
that
the
Saracens
have
invaded
Silesia
,
the
home
province
of
his
affianced
.

An
unusual
,
if
not
extraordinary
,
rendering
of
the
classic
myth
that
involves
the
rescue
of
Prometheus
from
the
rock
by
the
U.S.
Cavalry
was
given
last
week
in
the
warehouse
of
the
Albany
Leather
Conduit
Company
amid
cheers
of
``
Hubba
hubba
''
and
``
Yalagaloo
pip
pip
''
!
!

According
to
the
myth
,
Old
Order
then
vanishes
at
stage
left
and
reappears
at
extreme
stage
right
,
but
Director
Shuz
skillfully
sidesteps
the
rather
gooshey
problem
of
stage
effects
by
simply
having
Miss
Arapacis
walk
across
the
stage
.

We
caught
the
early
train
to
New
York
.

For
example
,
probably
very
few
people
know
that
the
word
``
visrhanik
''
that
is
bantered
about
so
much
today
stems
from
the
verb
``
bouanahsha
''
:
to
salivate
.

For
example
,
when
the
film
is
only
four
minutes
old
,
Neitzbohr
refers
to
a
small
,
Victorian
piano
stool
as
``
Wilhelmina
''
,
and
we
are
thereupon
subjected
to
a
flashback
that
informs
us
that
this
very
piano
stool
was
once
used
by
an
epileptic
governess
whose
name
,
of
course
,
was
Doris
(
the
English
equivalent
,
when
passed
through
middle-Gaelic
derivations
,
of
Wilhelmina
)
.

We
would
have
preferred
,
however
,
to
have
had
the
rest
of
the
orchestra
refrain
from
laughing
at
this
and
other
spots
on
the
recording
,
since
it
mars
an
otherwise
sober
,
if
not
lofty
,
performance
.

As
Broadway
itself
becomes
increasingly
weighted
down
by
trite
,
heavy-handed
,
commercially
successful
musicals
and
inspirational
problem
dramas
,
the
American
theatre
is
going
through
an
inexorable
renaissance
in
that
nebulous
area
known
as
``
off-Broadway
''
.

It
is
not
an
entirely
happy
book
,
as
Mrs.
Fink
soon
becomes
jealous
of
Alicia
and
,
in
retaliation
,
refuses
to
continue
to
scrape
the
algae
off
her
glass
.

The
battle
of
the
drib-drool
continues
,
but
most
of
New
York's
knowing
sophisticates
of
Abstract
Expressionism
are
stamping
their
feet
impatiently
in
expectation
of
V
(
for
Vindication
)
Day
,
September
first
,
when
Augustus
Quasimodo's
first
one-man
show
opens
at
the
Guggenheim
.

And
it
is
thought
by
many
who
think
about
such
things
that
Quasimodo
is
the
logical
culmination
of
a
school
that
started
with
Monet
,
progressed
through
Kandinsky
and
the
cubist
Picasso
,
and
blossomed
just
recently
in
Pollock
and
De
Kooning
.

``
I
paint
the
nothing
''
,
he
said
once
to
Franz
Kline
and
myself
,
``
the
nothing
that
is
behind
the
something
,
the
inexpressible
,
unpaintable
'
tick
'
in
the
unconscious
,
the
'
spirit
'
of
the
moment
resting
forever
,
suspended
like
a
huge
balloon
,
in
non-time
''
.

In
this
work
,
his
use
of
non-color
is
startling
and
skillful
.

I
asked
Quasimodo
recently
how
he
accomplished
this
,
and
he
replied
that
he
had
painted
his
model
``
a
beautiful
shade
of
red
and
then
had
her
breathe
on
the
canvas
''
,
which
was
his
typical
tongue-in-cheek
way
of
chiding
me
for
my
lack
of
sensitivity
.

Dear
Sirs
:
Let
me
begin
by
clearing
up
any
possible
misconception
in
your
minds
,
wherever
you
are
.

It
is
,
I
am
reliably
given
to
understand
,
the
technical
argot
for
those
who
engage
in
your
particular
branch
of
the
boost
;
;

Since
the
latter
obviously
require
an
audacity
you
do
not
possess
,
you
may
perhaps
suppose
that
I
am
taunting
you
as
socially
inferior
.

In
time
,
these
minor
manifestations
will
multiply
and
effloresce
,
riddling
you
with
frambesia
,
the
king's
evil
,
sheep
rot
,
and
clonic
spasm
,
until
your
very
existence
becomes
a
burden
and
you
cry
out
for
release
.

Very
peculiar
retribution
indeed
seems
to
overtake
such
jokers
.

Hell's
own
amount
of
chaulmoogra
oil
did
nothing
to
alleviate
their
torment
;
;

Likewise
the
ivory
Chinese
female
figure
known
as
a
``
doctor
lady
''
(
provenance
Honan
)
;
;

Oddly
enough
,
this
is
an
amulet
against
housebreakers
,
presented
to
the
mem
and
me
by
a
local
rajah
in
1949
.

The
teeth
will
rain
from
his
mouth
like
pebbles
,
his
wife
will
make
him
cocu
with
fishmongers
,
and
a
trolley
car
will
grow
in
his
stomach
.

The
cycle
of
disaster
starts
the
moment
they
touch
any
belonging
of
ours
,
and
dogs
them
unto
the
forty-fifth
generation
.

Our
suspicions
eventually
centered
,
by
the
process
of
elimination
,
on
a
grocer's
boy
,
a
thoroughly
bad
hat
,
who
delivered
cartons
to
the
people
overhead
.

I
learned
,
for
example
,
that
he
made
a
practice
of
yapping
at
dogs
he
encountered
and
,
in
winter
,
of
sprinkling
salt
on
the
icy
pavement
to
scarify
their
feet
.

Evenings
,
he
was
frequently
to
be
seen
at
restaurants
like
Enrico
&
Paglieri's
or
Peter's
Backyard
drunkenly
donning
ladies'
hats
and
singing
``
O
Sole
Mio
''
.

he
had
aged
thirty
years
,
and
his
face
,
the
color
of
tallow
,
was
crisscrossed
with
wrinkles
,
as
though
it
had
been
wrapped
in
chicken
wire
.

The
grocery
the
youth
worked
for
soon
tired
of
his
depressing
effect
on
customers
,
most
of
whom
were
sufficiently
neurotic
without
the
threat
of
incubi
,
and
let
him
go
.

He
evolved
programs
that
plumbed
new
depths
of
bathos
and
besmirched
whole
networks
,
and
quickly
superseded
his
boss
.

he
was
talking
to
himself
thirteen
to
the
dozen
and
smoking
two
cigars
at
once
,
clearly
a
man
in
extremis
.

``
See
that
guy
''
?
?

``
I
wouldn't
be
in
his
shoes
for
all
the
rice
in
China
.

The
inventory
you
acquired
from
me
isn't
going
to
be
easy
to
move
;
;

My
advice
,
if
you
live
long
enough
to
continue
your
vocation
,
is
that
the
next
time
you're
attracted
by
the
exotic
,
pass
it
up
--
it's
nothing
but
a
headache
.

As
you
can
count
on
me
to
do
the
same
.

the
doors
of
the
D
train
slid
shut
,
and
as
I
dropped
into
a
seat
and
,
exhaling
,
looked
up
across
the
aisle
,
the
whole
aviary
in
my
head
burst
into
song
.
