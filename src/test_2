that	cs

This	dt

at	in
the	at

in	in

With	in

With	in

Practically	rb

But	cc
on	in

The	at

We	ppss

that	cs

To	to

In	in

The	at

Hence	rb

a	at

The	at

The	at

The	at

It	pps

He	pps

He	pps

Then	rb

The	at

He	pps

It	pps

He	pps

Mercer	np

There	ex

He	pps
certainly	rb

Sometimes	rb
he	pps

The	at

there	ex

Each	dt

Because	cs

the	at

Morgan	np

He	pps

Her	pp$

He	pps

It	pps
was	bedz
mostly	rb
for	in

of	in
the	at

because	cs
hardly	rb
anybody	pn

Partly	rb
,	,
it	pps
was	bedz
because	cs
Pendleton	np

what	wdt
I	ppss
anticipated	vbd

Ida	np

where	wrb

Had	hvd

I	ppss

She	pps

I	ppss

Had	hvd

I	ppss

So	cs
I	ppss

Even	rb

And	cc

When	wrb

Everyone	pn
