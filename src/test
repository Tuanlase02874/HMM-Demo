how	wrb
could	md
anyone	pn
have	hv
questioned	vbn
this	dt
principle	nn
?	.
?	.

First	od
,	,
the	at
observational	jj
reasons	nns
.	.

The	at
obvious	jj
natural	jj
fact	nn
to	in

was	bedz
the	at
diurnal	jj
rotation	nn
of	in
the	at

The	at
conclusion	nn
--	--
the	at

did	dod
not	*

and	cc
their	pp$

The	at

also	rb
felt	vbn
to	to

the	at

of	in

things	nns
.	.

This	dt
,	,
conjoined	vbn
with	in
the	at
considerations	nns
above	rb
,	,
made	vbd
the	at
circular	jj
motions	nns
of	in
heavenly	jj
bodies	nns
appear	vb
an	at
almost	ql
directly	rb
observed	vbn
fact	nn
.	.

By	in
distinguishing	vbg
superlunary	jj
(	(
celestial	jj
)	)
and	cc
sublunary	jj
(	(

existence	nn
,	,
and	cc
reinforcing	vbg
this	dt
with	in
the	at
four-element	jj
physics	nn

in	in
only	rb
a	at

viz.	rb
in	in
a	at

Because	cs
motion	nn
which	wdt
begins	vbz
and	cc
ends	vbz
at	in
discrete	jj
places	nns
would	md
(	(
e.g.	rb

be	be

Circular	jj
motion	nn
,	,
however	rb
,	,
since	cs
it	pps
is	bez
eternal	jj
and	cc
perfectly	ql

lacks	vbz

Perfect	jj

if	cs

do	do
not	*

what	wdt
they	ppss

Thus	rb
,	,
circular	jj
motion	nn
is	bez
itself	ppl
one	cd
of	in
the	at
essential	jj
characteristics	nns
of	in
completely	ql

The	at

In	in

this	dt
tendency	nn
is	bez
well	rb
illustrated	vbn
by	in

I	ppss
believe	vb
a	at

in	in

for	in

In	in

a	at

to	to

that	wps
characterized	vbd
the	at

The	at
outlook	nn
for	in
entertainment	nn
electronics	nn
in	in
1961	cd
is	bez
certainly	rb
far	rb
from	in
clear	jj
at	in

but	cc
recent	jj
surveys	nns
have	hv
shown	vbn
a	at

on	in

of	in
consumers	nns
to	to
step	vb
up	rp
their	pp$
buying	vbg

for	in

I	ppss
would	md
expect	vb
that	cs
sales	nns
at	in

in	in
the	at
first	od
half	abn
of	in
1961	cd
might	md
be	be
below	in

by	in
some	dti
10	cd
-	in
15%	nn
but	cc
that	cs
second-half	nn
levels	nns
should	md
show	vb
a	at

with	in
a	at

of	in

late	rb
in	in

if	cs
business	nn
conditions	nns
recover	vb
as	cs
some	dti
recent	jj
forecasts	nns
suggest	vb
they	ppss
will	md
.	.

I	ppss
look	vb
for	in
TV	nn
sales	nns
and	cc
production	nn
to	to
be	be
approximately	ql
equal	jj
at	in
5.7	cd
million	cd
sets	nns
for	in
the	at

,	,
but	cc
I	ppss
look	vb
for	in
some	dti
decline	nn
in	in

from	in
the	at
high	jj

in	in
1961	cd

the	at

level	nn
of	in
15.0	cd
-	in
15.5	cd
million	cd

I	ppss
therefore	rb
believe	vb
it	pps
is	bez
realistic	jj
to	to
assume	vb
a	at
modest	jj
drop	nn
in	in
the	at

slightly	rb

above	in

It	pps

to	to

that	cs

Brakes	nns
